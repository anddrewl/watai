    "selftext": "# Single Cell Analysts and Investors are fucking wrong, and NVIDIA interest in INTEL proves it\n\nAI runs on GPUs, right? RIGHT?\n\nThe answer is it depends. And most people (including developers) don't know that, but they will know, eventually\n\nLet's begin with memory bandwidth from now on BW\n\nEach token generation requires accessing ALL model weights, that means for each output token you need to load the entire model so how fast you load that model in memory, for that bw was the major limitation of CPUs ultill the next gen\n\nThe current top xeon has 0.614TB/s which is a ton, and could be working on dual configuration with 6TB RAM at 1,7TB/s but Top GPUs like A100 have 2TB/s and H100 has 3TB/s, the next generation of Intel Xeon 18A is expected to have \\~2TB/s. Positioning near A100.\n\nBW tl;dr: \\*\\*Usually doubling bandwidth roughly doubles token generation speed  \nBW deepdive: \u00a0[https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1brcnps/is\\_inferencing\\_memory\\_bandwidth\\_limited/](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1brcnps/is_inferencing_memory_bandwidth_limited/)\n\n\n\nLet's keep going, usually big chunk papa models cannot and will not work on a CPU period, but advances in quantization(from now on Q\\_) made possible to run big papa models like gpt-oss 120b run on a CPU with a loss in accuracy near to 2%\n\nUsually models are based on 16B and Q\\_ down to 8 or 4, each time you half the number of bits, it halves the model size. For example GPT-OSS could run Q\\_8 with only 60GB what makes possible to run at any modern workstation CPU RAM. You have 2 modules of 32GB DDR5? Boom you can run Q\\_ big papa models\n\nQ\\_ tl;dr: CPUs can run big models on RAM now\n\nQ\\_ deepdive:\u00a0[https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/optimizing-llms-for-performance-and-accuracy-with-post-training-quantization/](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/optimizing-llms-for-performance-and-accuracy-with-post-training-quantization/)\n\n[https:\\/\\/developer.nvidia.com\\/blog\\/optimizing-llms-for-performance-and-accuracy-with-post-training-quantization\\/](https://preview.redd.it/xjqr7wqojcrf1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=7b50372aec5d17a684cfa3882534067d4bd58844)\n\nLet's talk about money, while a GPU is the king and surpasses the CPU in every metric possible, CPUs are crazy energy efficient and versatile, but what does it mean? It means that server providers are more prone to buy a CPU because they have a wider set of applications, and not only inference so they can have less idle time and more money back from their chips, since we discussed earlier, not everyone needs the biggest model available and token generation speed in new Xeon processors with CPU tokens per second sucks vs GPU they are not even close, but! Look at performance:\n\n[https:\\/\\/www.nscale.com\\/blog\\/cpu-inferencing-why-not](https://preview.redd.it/8h79t8kqjcrf1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=6e3f3f23a5491adf4064be81e5af3be9a53dd86c)\n\nOh boy, you can bet small to mid-sized businesses are going to notice this, since this graph is not suitable for large environments where inference is handled by a cluster using vLLM or other software that allows load distribution and pipeline parallelism.\n\nAnd they are not only crazy efficient but Intel is positioning at the most competitive chips for LLM inference per dollar:  \n[https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1jxwk05/intel\\_6944p\\_the\\_most\\_cost\\_effective\\_cpu\\_solution/](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1jxwk05/intel_6944p_the_most_cost_effective_cpu_solution/)\n\nLastly, the necessity of private LLM execution for small and mid-sized businesses is a niche that perfectly meets CPU inference.\n\n[https://openmetal.io/resources/blog/private-ai-cpu-vs-gpu-inference/](https://openmetal.io/resources/blog/private-ai-cpu-vs-gpu-inference/)\n\nOn top of all of this, Intel and NVIDIA reached an agreement which announcement literally says: \"For data centers, Intel will build NVIDIA-custom x86 CPUs that NVIDIA will integrate into its AI infrastructure platforms and offer to the market.\"  \n[https://newsroom.intel.com/artificial-intelligence/intel-and-nvidia-to-jointly-develop-ai-infrastructure-and-personal-computing-products](https://newsroom.intel.com/artificial-intelligence/intel-and-nvidia-to-jointly-develop-ai-infrastructure-and-personal-computing-products)  \nSo you can bet every board in a data center that works with Nvidia will have an Intel-manufactured CPU, which means that NVIDIA could be one of the first clients of the new Foundries that could be followed by other manufacturers and fabless chip designers.\n\ntl;dr: buy intel\n\npositons:\u00a0[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1fw14ev/in\\_intc\\_i\\_trust/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1fw14ev/in_intc_i_trust/)\n\n",

Well, in my experience market doesn\u2019t run on overvalued or undervalued, only on emotions. \nPrice seems pretty low currently so I bought in.\n\nThe Trade Desk (TTD) continues to demonstrate its strength as a long-term investment in the evolving digital advertising space. The company\u2019s robust demand-side platform enables advertisers to manage and optimize data-driven campaigns across various channels, including connected TV (CTV)\u2014a segment growing rapidly as traditional TV declines. CEO Jeff Green has previously stated, \u201cWe process more transactions in one day than Visa does in a year,\u201d underscoring the scale and efficiency of their real-time bidding architecture. TTD\u2019s platform is built on transparency and independence, positioning it well against walled gardens like Google and Meta.\n\nInstitutional confidence in TTD is also rising. Notably, Intech Investment Management LLC boosted its stake by over 5,700%, Los Angeles Capital Management LLC initiated a $68.6 million position, and ARK Invest (Cathie Wood) recently added 210,664 shares (~$29.5M) to its ARKW fund. LaFleur & Godfrey LLC and several others have also increased exposure. These large bets from respected hedge funds signal strong conviction in TTD\u2019s scalability and future cash flow.\n\nGiven its proven leadership, deep industry integration, and consistent innovation in programmatic ad tech, TTD is well-positioned for long-term growth\u2014especially as advertisers shift more spend toward measurable, real-time channels like CTV.\n\nMy positions included.

    "selftext": "If you\u2019ve seen my last couple posts I\u2019ve been pretty good at picking stocks near the bottom before a bull run. CRDO, NBIS, ENTG, GLXY and most recently MNDY which I did a DD on. The problem is I\u2019m a regard and mismanaged all of them for a loss except MNDY, but I\u2019m rolling those gains into what I present before you today: $TTD. \n\nTTD is an ad tech company that has received a series of aggressive prison beatings in the market on its way to becoming S&P 500\u2019s worst performing stock of 2025. They act as the Don Draper of advertising, so if you\u2019re a company that wants to advertise on platforms outside of the walled gardens you don\u2019t call each company individually you call TTD and they help you find the best spots for your money across the channels they have access to. Most of TTD\u2019s slide this year is in reaction to the walled gardens (GOOG, AMZN, META) getting bigger because TTD doesn\u2019t have access to youtube, prime video and ig.\n\n[Shanked by Google, jumped by Amazon, and left holding META's lunch tray. ](https://preview.redd.it/j4cdi2znn4qf1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=5a3a6bef7e1489a97126b63dca60e2c49fe2ff07)\n\nThey aren\u2019t taking this lying down, TTD bought back $647 mil between the first two quarters of 25 and have $375 mil left to use under that approval. Buybacks like this are bc the c suite is either putting their dicks on the table and saying \u201cwe\u2019re undervalued\u201d or they want to cook the books and boost eps. I don\u2019t care either way because I think they\u2019ll buoy the share price at the 52 wk low. The fed cuts also boost valuation models making future earnings look better for a growth stock like TTD. \n\nThe DOJ vs. Goog ad tech remedies case begins next week. Guilt for Goog has already been decided, this is now about how they will change their monopoly on digital advertising by controlling both the publisher and ad exchange. DOJ is pushing for a breakup of the stack, which would give TTD access to premium inventory and be a huge tailwind. Most of the c suite for TTD has testified at one point in this trial and the CEO said \u201cTTD managed to win in an unfair market, imagine what we could do in a fair market\u201d. Well I\u2019m putting my $$ on CEO Jeff Green\u2019s imaginings. \n\n[Got flamed last time for posting after my position was already up so this is hot off the press.](https://preview.redd.it/m6lu0fd3o4qf1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=7d54a33d6a6fbefca78b474a478c3e828bb6b776)\n\nFinal considerations are for their new AI tools and the possibility of M&A. Kokai and OpenPath will be fully launched by the end of this year, these are meaningful next gen innovations. Brands using Kokai so far have seen a 43% lower cost per household reach on ads and OpenPath has led to 39% bump in CTV revenue for clients like Vizio. If the remedies case forces Goog to make major changes, the rest of big tech could say fuck it and buy TTD given the current depressed valuation, giving better reach in the open internet and picking up a competitor. Big media like Disney or Roku could also integrate or partner to control supply path and reduce dependency, like what we just saw with Amazon and Netflix. \n\nAlso incredibly small flyer chance TikTok\u2019s walled garden is opened up in the US acquisition giving TTD further opportunity.",

I'm sure they can figure out a way to extract more than $20 in revenue from that market. Lots of people have streaks exceeding 1000 days.

    "selftext": "So Snap\u2019s stock has been in free fall \u2014 down over 90% from the $80 peak in 2021, now sitting around $7. At the same time, the company still has ~469M daily active users, mostly Gen Z, who treat it like an operating system for their social life (AR lenses, Bitmoji, Maps, AI assistant, etc).\n\nHere\u2019s the case for why people think Snap is a buyout candidate:\n\t\u2022\tValuation: Trading at one of the lowest price-to-sales multiples in social media. Dirt cheap compared to Meta, Pinterest, or TikTok\u2019s implied value.\n\t\u2022\tUser Base: Half a billion DAUs is nothing to sneeze at. Extremely sticky with younger demographics.\n\t\u2022\tStrategic Fit: Big tech (Google, Amazon, Apple, Disney, Netflix, etc) could bolt this onto their ecosystem. Rumors of Alphabet interest pre-IPO have floated before.\n\t\u2022\tMarket Sentiment: Polls show a lot of retail/institutional investors believe Snap gets bought out in the next 1\u20132 years.\n\nBut here\u2019s the catch:\n\t\u2022\tFounder Control: Evan Spiegel & Bobby Murphy still hold ~96% of the voting power. If they don\u2019t want to sell, it doesn\u2019t matter how attractive the numbers look.\n\t\u2022\tCurrent Strategy: Snap\u2019s been on offense, buying up smaller apps like Saturn (popular in U.S. high schools). That\u2019s not what you do if you\u2019re prepping for a sale.\n\t\u2022\tExecution Risk: Advertising headwinds, competition from TikTok/Instagram, and weak monetization continue to crush the stock.\n\nTL;DR: On paper, Snap looks like one of the most attractive acquisition targets in tech cheap, highly engaged user base, potential fit for multiple buyers. But with founder control and ongoing internal growth moves, it\u2019s far from a guaranteed outcome.

Alphabet finance chief Anat Ashkenazi, who joined the company last year,\u00a0said\u00a0in October that she would push cost cuts \u201ca little further.\u201d Google has offered buyouts to employees since January, and the company has slowed hiring,\u00a0asking\u00a0employees to do more with less.\n\nRegarding the buyouts, executives at the town hall said that a total of 10 product areas have presented \u201cVoluntary Exit Program\u201d offers. They\u2019ve applied to U.S.-based employees in search, marketing, hardware and people operations teams this year.\u00a0\n\nFiona Cicconi, Google\u2019s chief people officer, said at last week\u2019s meeting that between 3% and 5% of employees on those teams have accepted the buyouts.\n\n\u201cThis has been actually quite successful,\u201d she said, adding \u201cI think we can continue it.\u201d\n\nPichai said the company executed the\u00a0voluntary buyouts\u00a0after listening to employees, who said they preferred that route to blanket layoffs.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a lot of work that\u2019s gone into implementing the VEP program, and I\u2019m glad we\u2019ve done it,\u201d Pichai said. \u201cIt gives people agency, and I\u2019m glad to see it\u2019s worked out well.\u201d\n\n\u2018Wanting a career break\u2019\n\nCicconi said one of the main reasons employees are taking the buyouts is because they want to take time off from work.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s actually quite interesting to see who\u2019s taking a VEP, and it\u2019s people sort of wanting a career break, sometimes to take care of family members,\u201d she said.\n\nCNBC previously reported that the layoffs\u00a0hurt morale\u00a0as the company was downsizing while at the same time issuing blowout earnings and seeing its stock price jump. Alphabet\u2019s shares are up 10% this year after climbing 36% in 2024 and 58% the year prior.\n\nAt another point in the town hall, employees asked if Google would consider a policy similar to\u00a0Meta\u2019s\u00a0\u201crecharge,\u201d a month-long sabbatical that employees earn after five years at the company.\n\n\u201cWe have a lot of leaves, not least our vacation, which is there for exactly that \u2014 resting and recharging,\u201d said Alexandra Maddison, Google\u2019s senior director of benefits.\n\nShe said the company is not going to offer paid sabbatical.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re very confident that our current offering is competitive,\u201d Maddison said.\n\nMeta didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nOther executives jumped in to compare the two companies\u2019 benefits.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think they have a VEP at Meta by the way,\u201d Cicconi said.\n\nPichai then asked, to some laughs from the audience, \u201cShould we incorporate all policies of Meta while we\u2019re at it? Or should we only pick and choose the few policies we like?\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe I should try running the company with all of Meta\u2019s policies,\u201d he continued. \u201cNo, probably not.\u201d",

    "selftext": "Alright listen up you red crayon eaters. Because it is time to turn your -90% portfolios to +400%.\n\nCoreWeave has been bashed in recent times due to mounting debts. But not many billionaires would advise you to keep emergency cash in fact, borrowing is the meta to becoming rich. The printer never stops, you just need to outgrow inflation and grab all that newly minted benjamins. If CoreWeave was a soy boy, they'd be delisted in 2 years. To win, you need to take risks, and CoreWeave has done exactly that.\n\nSure their business model is absolutely asset intensive but 99% of men love assets. But enough yappers. Because I will show you some calculations on the breakdown on their CAPEX, and estimated OPEX.\n\nBefore we begin, as with most bullshit corporate documents, I will outline assumptions based on Gemini-able, GPT-able, GROX-able information. We will be assuming land cost, PUE, construction costs, and IT costs in estimates. Utility prices will be taken off latest available information off the net.\n\nCoreWeave has reported that they are on track to deliver up to 900MW in their 2025 guidance. This is almost double their current active capacity, sitting at 470MW. But oh boy those datacenters they are gonna erect will give many Wallstreet Buffets wannabe ED. Sure, datacenters are expensive but the premium of these bad boy Grace and Blackwell supercomputers can command gives me viagra on crack and Redbull. The following calculations are all based in USD.\n\n**First up CAPEX (on 430MW)**\n\nHard Construction Costs: $18M per Megawatt  \nSoft Construction Costs: 20% of Hard Construction Costs  \nLand Required/MW: \\~550m^(2)\u00a0(5,920ft^(2)\u00a0for retards)  \nLand Cost/m^(2)\u00a0: $20  \nJensen Baby Cost per GB300 NVL72: \\~$3M (each takes up 130kW)  \nAssume 80% Fit-out of GB300 NVL72: 2,646 GB300 NVL72s = $7,939M  \nOther supporting racks/IT (20% fit-out): $5M/MW = $430M\n\n**Total CAPEX = $7,939M + $430M + $4.73M + $7,740M + $1,548M = $17,661.73M**\n\n**Next up OPEX (on 430MW)**\n\nTotal IT Power = 430MW  \nAssumed PUE = 1.2  \nTotal Power Consumption = 516MW  \nCommercial Power Price = $0.1185/kWh  \nTotal Cost for Energy = $535.64M/year\n\nEstimated Water Consumption = 2m^(3)/hour/MW  \nCommercial Water Price = $6/m^(3)  \nTotal Price of Water = $45.21M/year\n\nAsset Maintenance for IT (including depreciation): 5% of IT Cost/year  \nTotal Maintenance cost for IT = $418.45M/year  \nAsset Maintenance for Electrical Systems: 3% of System Cost/year (41% of Construction Cost)  \nTotal Maintenance cost for Electrical Systems = $95.20M/year  \nAsset Maintenance for Mechanical Systems: 4% of System Cost/year (25% of Construction Cost)  \nTotal Maintenance cost for Electrical Systems = $77.40M/year\n\nHeadcount: estimated 806, prorated  \nEstimated average payroll/head: $150,000  \nTotal payroll: $120.9M/ year\n\n**Total Annual OPEX = $535.64M + $45.21M + $418.45M + $95.20M + $77.40M + $120.9M = $1292.80M (excl interest expenses and depreciation)**\n\nConsidering CRWV announced capital expenditure of $20 \\~ $23 billion, probably likely includes financing leases and acquisition of Core Scientific. But what the hell do they mean?\n\nBased on earlier Q2 earnings suggests, the revenue per Megawatt is \\~$11M. If we scale that up without considering any premium for the GB200/GB300, the revenue for just this 430MW is \\~$4.73B, logically speaking, we might be looking at almost $5.4B instead.\n\nTech refresh cycles that is gonna be 3/4 years for these chips, that's fair. But these chips don't just go obsolete / worthless because some accountant deems their \"useful\" life a certain number of years. They can be repurposed, if they retain even 30% of their value in 3 years, the ROI will look even better, and eventually, D&A becomes very misleading and conservative. The buildings and infrastructure are good for 10, 20 years so retrofitting them at fraction of the initial construction costs to suit future needs.\n\nConsidering EBITDA, the ROI is as low as 4.4 years, and based on GAAP, the ROI could be 10 years (4 years cycle). And if we consider 30% resale value of these chips at end of 4 years, the ROI can be 8.7 years.\n\nCurrently, the FY25 guidance are reporting a mix of Hopper racks and maybe just a quarter of GB200/GB300. As CRWV gain more contracts using GB200 & GB300, and if they can grab and monopolize much of the available Blackwell chips, CRWV can command a higher premium. NVDA's stake in CRWV allows them to get priority access to latest chips, and they are very likely to be first to deploy the Vera Rubin slated to launch in 2026.\n\nThe whole AI shenanigans is still at the infant stages, all these large language models is really just the beginning. CRWV having 2.2GW of contracted capacity after acquiring Core Scientific is a calculated and strategic step to ensure they have room to grow at the pace they want to meet the demand they see.\n\nPlease do fact check my numbers if you have actual industry knowledge in the US, but they should be in the higher range. I highly believe actual numbers are even more optimistic.\n\n**TLDR:**\u00a0CoreWeave is basically lighting money on fire today so it can sell compute at premium tomorrow. Their $20\u201323B capex plan is insane scale, but it checks out: racks of $3M GB200/GB300, $18M/MW concrete palaces, and power bills that could run a small country.\n\nYes, depreciation nukes GAAP, but that\u2019s just accounting cosplay \u2014 the GPUs don\u2019t turn to dust after 3 years, they still earn or can be resold. Interest costs are a real drag, but adjusted EBITDA margins (\\~60%+) show the core biz is printing.\n\nThe risk? Expansion outpaces demand or tech cycles compress faster than resale value. The upside? CRWV has Nvidia\u2019s golden ticket, first dibs on new silicon, and 2.2GW of contracted capacity locked. Revenue will double, as a low hanging fruit next year.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/betiouf7molf1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=2e039bec58f44e4e8a2e1af75594404327adf7b7\n\n**Position:**\u00a0175 shares @ $92.00 avg.\n\nNumbers go brrr, depreciation makes GAAP cry, but the growth story is very real.\n\n\\*EDIT 1: Regards calling this GPT generated is about maybe half right. The TLDR was generated by GPT. The rest, from my experience as a data center infrastructure designer. ",

There is a computing shortage for these AI companies and data centre companies who provide high power computing (hpc) and picking up hype.

    "selftext": "My positions: 1920 shares of $GOOGL. Kept on buying up so don't know what the average price is but around 190s.\n\nWhy: $GOOGL $GOOG is arguably one of the best AI companies out there. Google deepmind ( led by demis hasabis) is on par with openai and probably more better. Talent rich, cash rich, growing at scale and expanding.\n\nMoonshots: \n1)Everyone talks about how search will die because of chatGPT etc. No! Earnings for the last 3 quarters have proved re-acceleration in search at almost 11% YoY.\n\n2) YouTube now the most watched form of content. Almost all TV have it and YouTube shorts does 200b of views! Yotube is growing like crazy and content on it is proving to be better then most tv. The new generation will have also grown up on yotube and many have yotube subscription which is also a direct competitor of Spotify- you get free yotube music.\n\n3) GCP - Google cloud. Growing like crazy. Now at $55b run rate. Sundar said they signed more $1B+ deal in the CURRENT quarter, then all of 2024!!! Examples include Salesforce, oracle, OpenAi ( yes them) for compute and GCP. They are growing rapidly due to TPU being super cheap and and cost effective. Constant reinvestment and growth will see them end up with a 100b business in cloud by 2028!!!\n\n4) Gemini - google own LLm. On my benchmarks, this is one of the best models out there. This is being integrated into Google search view Ai overviews + Google ai mode search ( only india and usa have it) try it out. Not only that, they have the best video generation model and world models with Veo 3 & genie 3. Gemini is becoming an enterprise software that many companies are embedding alongside cloud and GCP.\n\n5) stabel growth segments - Google networks are not talked about. Android, play store, Google pixel,  watch and ear phone are in total $50b+ in annual revenue. The upcoming catalyst for this is Pixel 10 release with Google AI embedded in the phone. Google have also entered into the world of VR glasses that will be the most cost effective one. This will be in partnership with eye brand gentle monster who provide hardware for Google software. This will beat Apple ai vision pro and upcoming meta glasses on price point alone.\n\n6) investment - Google are constantly investing into other business and themselves. They have just announced a $9b investment for data centres in Oklahoma. This is in addition to $25b for data centes in usa. They have also announced $6b projection near completion in India- a multi billion industry. They have given all kids in college free google tools and gemini pro to the value of $1B, and have projects going for google fiber for underwater sea cable networks. Rapid expansion across all vertices. They are investing into ai for drug discovery which had began human trials for cancer cures (isomorpic labs) and have constant investments into waymo - which is set to launch outside of USA and begin operations in Japan very soon. A stand alone valuation of waymo is around $150b.\n\nRisk: The doj wants to break up google. They think it's a monopoly. The ruling is due anytime now. Given how unrealistic a break up is likely and could destroy google I don't see it happening. Even the prez of usa himself said he doesn't want them broken up,  he has said google is a innovative American company in tech conference a few weeks ago. I expect some remedial actions out of this which will life alot of risks from google.\n\nValuation: this is currently trading at cheapest valuation of 20x PE. OR 17x FWD P/E. The next mag 7 close go this is $meta at 29 PE.\nA re rating could send $GOOGL on an nvida like run all the way to $280. \n\nMy plays: common shares that I'm selling at $300 + 40k in various calls and leaps. \n\nPositions from a brokage located outside of Usa/ in nz.

    "selftext": "**Original DD:**[ 1.3m $RDDT Bet - Too Many Ways to Win](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1l37l3m/13m_rddt_bet_too_many_ways_to_win/)\n\n**Updated timeline:** At current execution pace, I expect $300+ within 6 months. The money machine is hitting on all cylinders, and we're still in the early innings of Reddit's transformation.\u00a0\n\nThree months ago, I laid out why RDDT is going higher and we are fucking winning! Congrats to everyone who joined in. As of last Friday, the stock is up 80%+ as management started executing on the points I stated in my last DD. They still haven\u2019t touched the speculative stuff yet and they probably won\u2019t for a few years. ARPU is up 47% yoy and they are just getting started.\u00a0\n\n**ARPU**\n\nARPU increased 47% to $4.53 this quarter. The CFO called this \"still very low\" and he's right. Even reaching half of Meta's $12+ yield would more than double current revenue.\n\nReddit's new ad products are printing money:\n\n* **Dynamic Product Ads (DPA):** 2x higher ROAS than standard campaigns (basically this means Reddit Ads add lots of value to advertisers compared to other sites)\u00a0\n* **Reddit Community Intelligence**\n   * Advertisers can query the collective knowledge from the billions of human conversations that take place on Reddit.\u00a0\n   * \u201cAn advertiser got an idea on the spot for a potential Super Bowl ad next year,\u201d from Reddit Community Intelligence\u00a0\n* Reddit hired enterprise sales people to get the word out on these new products.\n   * **This resulted in 50%+ growth in active advertisers.**\n\nYou obviously use Reddit. Turn off your ad blockers and start paying attention to ad quality and frequency because it is dramatically improving. If you don\u2019t believe me, go see for yourself.\n\n**Management Execution**This quarter proves management can execute flawlessly. Jen Wong that beautiful bastard is at the forefront for the advertiser product suite and is driving ARPU growth of 47%.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5wato4pnuzif1.png?width=1258&format=png&auto=webp&s=204eee5a3d8ff7bce7e9de24490f78b1836b5339\n\nReddit has barely started capitalizing on the potential they have and still have tons of runway with more shopping features, marketplaces, streaming and premium sub-reddits. Premium sub-reddits will be huge, but not as huge as being able to take market share from Google.\u00a0\n\n# Improving Search\n\nReddit wants users to stay. More eyeballs, more money, and this is an easy problem to solve. Reddit's search is so broken that users Google \"question + Reddit\" instead of searching directly on the platform. Reddit is fixing this by combining traditional search with AI-powered answers in one interface. This model is already proven by current AI products and Reddit is perfectly positioned to grab this pie. Instead of external search > quick answer > exit, users will search internally > find answers > discover communities > scroll.\n\nThe monetization impact is huge. Every seeker that becomes a scroller drives exponentially higher ARPU through increased ad exposure and deeper engagement. In the age of dying search engines, Reddit is building their own answer engine that keeps users on the platform and decreases their dependence on search engines for growth.\u00a0\n\n# Data Moat Monetization\n\nReddit has publicly announced that AI companies are rock hard for their data and now they have started to protect it. Reddit recently engaged Cloudflare to block AI webcrawlers from scraping. Microsoft already confirmed Bing is blocked while Google continues indexing due to their licensing deal. [https://searchengineland.com/microsoft-confirms-reddit-blocked-bing-search-444385](https://searchengineland.com/microsoft-confirms-reddit-blocked-bing-search-444385)\n\nEarlier this year Reddit sued Anthropic for unauthorized scraping. Regardless of legal outcomes, Reddit forced them to the negotiating table. Most LLMs still source Reddit data without compensation but that's changing fast. As Cloudflare's CEO perfectly stated: \"AI companies understand that original content is fuel for their engines. The assumption that content will be free is ending.\"\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ujgewd2quzif1.png?width=1230&format=png&auto=webp&s=75e8984758601e5d5f2d8cd9d99f484e655fe8e3\n\nReddit's about to manifest destiny the hell out of AI monetization.\n\nEach of the bots below is another potential contract for Reddit. As Reddit is such a unique and valuable source this gives them much more pricing power than in their previous deals. Now that Reddit\u2019s data is protected, Reddit can receive 10x their current licensing fees. AI companies are extracting billions in value from Reddit's data and soon Reddit will capture their fair share.\n\n# S&P 500 Inclusion\n\nAfter this last quarter\u2019s earnings report, RDDT is now likely to be added into the S&P 500. QQQ too if RDDT changes its exchange to the NASDAQ. Additionally, the S&P 500 committee will likely find RDDT a compelling addition to the index, as the committee strives to include companies from a diverse range of industries. Reddit is classified under the Internet Content and Information subsector, one of the smallest and least diverse sections of the index; currently there\u2019s only 3 stocks in this sector which makes it the least diverse subsector.\n\nReddit meets all quantitative criteria and offers the committee exactly what they want, a growing, profitable US company that enhances sector balance while representing emerging economic trends, making Reddit a natural fit for inclusion.\u00a0\n\n**Summary**\n\nManagement said ARPU growth \"will continue to be a significant opportunity,\u201d and they have proven they can execute on it. With the way management is hustling and executing RDDT still looks cheap.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jm5sj993xzif1.png?width=2634&format=png&auto=webp&s=871205da2d74601a0b0350db4e41336a6340a7d6\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q2lwp1g7xzif1.png?width=1206&format=png&auto=webp&s=98fbf9fd61f848d5f3655d73d2c5065b8c55716b\n\n  \n\n\n",

    "selftext": "**Position**\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n3000 call options for January 2026 with a 30 USD strike price; you can also see in my previous postings that I hadn\u2019t sold when we were at almost $40 and then when it went all the way down, I added to my Unity position.\u00a0\n\n  \n**Disclaimer**\n\nThis isn\u2019t financial advice. This is all just for your entertainment.\n\n**TLDR of the TLDR**\n\nUnity can do an AppLovin stock move if Unity\u2019s new AI-Powered ad Platform Vector succeeds. So far, Vector has \u201cfar exceeded our expectations\u201d according to the CEO Bromberg 1 week ago. My 1 year price target is $200. That would represent around half of AppLovin\u2019s current market cap; their main competitor in the ad space. Unity powers 70% of mobile games with their engine (Unity software is on 2.5 billion devices - you read that right, read it again and maybe one more time. This also includes the China market\u2026 ), but until Vector they haven\u2019t really capitalized on this potential moat. In the short-term gamma squeezes and even a short squeeze (9.28% shorted) are possible because various whales are buying OTM call options en masse and up to 88.26% of Unity is institutionally held and most positions have been made when the stock was over $100 (according to Fintel) which creates illiquidity as institutions likely won\u2019t want to sell a turn-around stock in a bull market when they are still in the minus. In other words, if you bet on Unity, you are riding together with the whales. And if you think gaming has a future and ads will play a role, especially on mobile phones and VR (60% of VR games are made with Unity), and you are still here, you might as well read my intro and the TLDR.\u00a0\n\n  \n[https://images.fintel.io/us-u-so.png](https://images.fintel.io/us-u-so.png) \n\n  \n**About me**\n\nI went from 27k to 5M+ in less than 2 years (see my previous posts on WSB), but I also lost 180k back in the SPAC days and had to start again from scratch. This taught me that I should only invest in undervalued\u00a0 companies that have some sort of actual moat. Previously I went with long-term calls into PLTR at around $8 and then into SOFI at around $7 (which btw at that time people also argued were overvalued). Unity is my third and only play. The rest I have in cash. My life hasn\u2019t changed much (only my parents know and 2 friends), but whatever happens, I\u2019ll be able to create an animal shelter for homeless dogs and other animals.\u00a0\n\n**TLDR**\n\nUnity is a turn-around, it has almost 0 interest from the retail community (try yourself and search on YouTube or X if anything received lots of interactions in the recent 1-2 years. This is good, because we are so early that no popular finfluencer is covering it), it\u2019s actually even hated among retail because of Unity\u2019s previous management and its runtime fee non-sense. Since their new CEO Bromberg took over 15 months ago, Unity not only reversed the runtime fee decisions, but also double beat on their earnings each time. Last week they did it again and analysts all upgraded Unity stock based on the most recent quarter. Still the stock is beaten down when you look at the 5 year chart (Unity used to trade above $200). I am not a technical trader, but I like beaten down stocks that are in the accumulation zone for years while the underlying company double beats each quarter and keeps growing. I like it even more when we are now witnessing the first great results of an AI product that hasn\u2019t even started yet - Vector. It reminds me of when Palantir introduced their AIP bootcamps, their game changer. Ok, I tricked you. The TLDR of the TLDR and this TLDR are actually just an introduction. You might as well read the rest now. At least try to read the next sentence and see if it gets you hooked for more.\u00a0\n\n**AppLovin, Unity\u2019s main competitor**\n\nAppLovin (Ticker APP - check out what their stock did in the last 12 months as inspiration) tried to buy Unity in 2022 for $58.85 per share and Unity rejected because they much rather wanted to compete with AppLovin in ads since Unity has the better moat (they provide the engine on which the games run). Based on some rumors they tried buying them a second time last year. However often AppLovin really tried to buy Unity, I am relieved that I could still invest in Unity.\u00a0\n\n**Secret whale(s)**\n\nIn the background there\u2019s an investor or multiple investors that have been putting $40M+ in the last few weeks on Unity OTM call options. Whoever that is, they got balls of steel as they are riding all ups and downs like a madman and keep accumulating. Yesterday alone around $10M was added to this Friday\u2019s options chain. If Unity holds above $37.50 until Friday, we might see a gamma squeeze. Also, with up to 90% institutional ownership, where the majority is way underwater, thus likely not selling (which makes the stock illiquid) and Unity being almost 10% shorted, we might see a short squeeze. It\u2019s not my main investment thesis, but definitely fun to watch this unfold. It\u2019s still a big if, so don\u2019t bet on it.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n**Unity and AppLovin experts**\n\nIf you don\u2019t believe me because I am just claiming to be a wizard and can\u2019t even write wizard, make sure to invest 3 hours of your time to watch 2 podcasts of the GameMakers (one is from Apr 8, 2025 and the other one is from June 10th, 2025; you can find it on YT) and watch how they are slowly changing their opinion full of skepticism towards Unity\u2019s new Vector platform to seeing some potential opportunity for Unity to then 5 days ago Josh Chandley, Co-Founder at WildCard (mobile) Games, posting this:\n\n  \n[https://www.linkedin.com/posts/joshchandley\\_%F0%9D%97%A8%F0%9D%97%BB%F0%9D%97%B6%F0%9D%98%81%F0%9D%98%86%F0%9D%98%80-%F0%9D%98%80%F0%9D%98%81%F0%9D%97%BC%F0%9D%97%B0%F0%9D%97%B8-%F0%9D%97%B1%F0%9D%97%BF%F0%9D%97%BC%F0%9D%97%BD%F0%9D%97%BD%F0%9D%97%B2%F0%9D%97%B1-%F0%9D%9F%B2-activity-7359210962823909376-VEah/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=member\\_desktop&rcm=ACoAAAGIzIkBUdZilpoVRXo18tu0TjDzcMZLfr8](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/joshchandley_%F0%9D%97%A8%F0%9D%97%BB%F0%9D%97%B6%F0%9D%98%81%F0%9D%98%86%F0%9D%98%80-%F0%9D%98%80%F0%9D%98%81%F0%9D%97%BC%F0%9D%97%B0%F0%9D%97%B8-%F0%9D%97%B1%F0%9D%97%BF%F0%9D%97%BC%F0%9D%97%BD%F0%9D%97%BD%F0%9D%97%B2%F0%9D%97%B1-%F0%9D%9F%B2-activity-7359210962823909376-VEah/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAAGIzIkBUdZilpoVRXo18tu0TjDzcMZLfr8) \n\n  \nAnd have a look who is liking this. Multiple employees in senior roles at Unity wouldn\u2019t outright confirm any numbers obviously (they like to sandbag and then doublebeat at the earnings). So, feel free to have a look at this LinkedIn posting and check for yourself how many Unity employees liked that posting. It\u2019s around 50+ Unity employees. Here\u2019s one senior employee:\n\n  \n[https://ibb.co/0RfpB8YB](https://ibb.co/0RfpB8YB)\n\n  \n**Unity partners**\n\nNot surprisingly as the biggest engine provider in the world Unity is partnered with Apple, Google, Microsoft, Nintendo, Meta (for the Oculus) and Sony (for the PlayStation), but also with Tencent to help developers bring more games to China. They are also partnered with lots of other companies, even multiple car manufacturers (Mercedes-Benz, Toyota etc.) to create 3D models.\n\n**Macro cycle**\n\nWe never know what Trump is up to and if we will get the next recession this year, next year or with the next president. But what we know is that we are at all-time-highs. Typically in all-time-highs the more speculative and smaller cap stocks go up. Unity fundamentally isn\u2019t a highly speculative stock, but it is perceived as one. So, even if you think that we will soon have a recession, Unity might as well go up in the short-term. For the intermediate term in case of a recession, millions of people losing their jobs would cause what? 4 years ago when people lost their jobs and were at home they were playing (mobile) games and many programmers also created games. This was the time when Unity stock was above $200. And now with generative AI it will be even easier to create new mobile games. Unity is still the best game engine for new developers. In short, I am not too worried about Unity even if a recession hits anytime soon.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n**Unity red flag:**\n\nYes, I am honest here. There\u2019s also something critical about Unity. I am fine with stock-based-compensation. That\u2019s normal for such companies to keep talent and attract more talent. But when I read through Glassdoor reviews, Unity employees emphasize the great work-life-balance\u2026 Sorry, but if any Unity employees read this: AppLovin has eaten your breakfast, lunch and dinner in the last few years. True, you previously had really bad management. But now with your CEO Bromberg and Vector you have a real chance to eat their dessert. That\u2019s the best food anyway. So, in the next 9-12 months keep pushing like never before to get it! I believe in unity. You have been waiting for this long enough.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0",

    "selftext": "**DD/TLDR Rocket Reason**\n\n1. NVIDIA and all big tech are customers\n2. 20% short interest - presumably because of financial reporting fears. SMCI went from 3 million shares short a quarter ago to 95 million shares short now (Fintel). I know finance and this is no longer a problem. SMCI clearly announced they Do Not Need to restate earnings and their auditors found no instances of fraud (given US laws, you don\u2019t casually declare this on an earnings call).\u00a0\n3. Meeting or even slightly beating earnings will squeeze the shorts\u2019 balls blue. OPEN had a short interest of 20.73%, look what happened when it squeezed.\n4. Massive expected INCREASE in AI spend. Ex: Recent Google earnings announced increase to $85 billion. X (Grok) working to launch millions of GPUs and shipping a \u201cpower plant\u201d from Europe to power it. Every AI player (MSFT, META, AMZN, Open AI etc) will do the same increasing spend to the 70-90bill range. TSMC also reported great earnings. Clear sign demand is accelerating not slowing.\n5. International expansion - SMCI won a Major Exclusive $20 billion DataVolt (Saudi Arabia) deal, Ericsson.\n6. Raised 2.3 billion cash and sold 1.79 billion in receivables for expansion. Big-brain move at 0% interest with capped calls. They are currently generating cash and not burning it, which means the money is primarily for planned massive growth and expansion.\n7. BofA Analist Ruplu Bhattacharya, has a $35 price target on SMCI, but had a price target of $1,090 at one point, which is a ridiculous joke. Big funds probably have major short positions and are now caught with their pants down and are using their Analist to beat prices down. They don\u2019t know computers. If SMCI reports spectacular earnings on 8/5/2025, and their tits get squeezed, she\u2019ll be relegated to OnlyFans.",

    "title": "$SNAP: Sneaky (undervalued) Agentic AI Player",
    "selftext": "SNAP is being valued like a struggling social media app, which it is. More importantly, as the last true social network it is a uniquely valuable dataset and data collection platform for the agentic AI era. \n\n**The Agentic AI Era**\n\n\"A person who thinks all the time has nothing to think about except thoughts. So, he loses touch with reality and lives in a world of illusions.\"\n\n-Alan Watts\n\nLLMs (ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude) at this point have essentially solved language. After advances in model training approaches and hardware, this was a lot easier to do than expected, largely due to the vast and varied amount of digitized written text on the internet. \n\nWhile these products are already revolutionizing certain professions, the industry and investors are already looking to the next thing. There\u2019s a couple ideas on the horizon. One is superintelligence (aka, Meta), turbocharged LLMs that are smarter than humans. The other is agentic functioning, AI that is designed to do things. Here, superintelligence is not as critical, performance is tied to social functioning as they interface with systems designed for people. \n\nAgentic AI can mean a few things and to varying degrees of complexity. Nearest to basic LLM, quasi-machine friendly systems, an AI agent may call your doctor's office for you and schedule an appointment with your receptionist. In more advanced but still mostly text-based forms, an AI agent may manage your calendar, negotiate simple purchases, or coordinate services with other AIs on your behalf. The larger stride in agentic AI is past digital and text based medium, into handling decision making on your behalf in real world contexts- think interacting with household objects, interpreting social signals, threat detection and protection.  This is the area of humanoid robotics, currently receiving massive investments from Telsa, and an inevitable target for the rest of the big tech players. \n\nLike with LLMs- sounds hard until it's not. The technical breakthrough will hinge in sourcing and leveraging ideal datasets. Tesla is currently training their Optimus robots on data streams like YouTube videos, but in terms of acting and behaving like humans, there is a non-public, unparalleled training dataset available. This is a dataset that will make humanoid robotic devices that need to be socially aware, navigate the world in context of social cues, and build trust relationships with owners. To be clear, it a critical piece to an LLM-sized breakthrough, and perhaps greater, in agentic AI. \n\nAnd unlike superintelligence (the nerdy kid who has read about how to be cool in books), performant agentic AI will be more impactful than superintelligence in the same manner as Chad, who has failed up his whole life due to his social prowess. \n\n**The Slow Death of the Social Network**\n\nBefore we look more in depth at SNAP, let's check in on the \"social media\" landscape. A social network is a platform where people who know each other use technology to improve or enhance their peer-to-peer or community engagements. Here's why they largely do not exist anymore:\n \nFacebook: Ad delivery system for youths with little / no natural actual real world social dynamics present. Maybe still something of a social network for boomers, but boomers Facebook experience is also fairly corrupted by AI / brainrot content that they can\u2019t distinguish from reality.\n\nTiktok/instagram: endless scroll, optimized for large content creators, little to organic peer to peer social aspects, not for people who know each other to talk with each other. \n\nReddit: terminally online autists exchange asynchronous messages largely around upvote farming and out-cringing each other. \n\nSnap: The only at-scale platform where people still communicate directly with people they actually know. Core experience still chat, video, voice, maps, streaks (read small, high-frequency, high-context exchanges). True to what social networks were originally envisioned as, it\u2019s a high-resolution behavioral mirror of human life, especially among younger generations, and still dominated by exchanges between socially adept individuals who have non-online relationships.\n \n**Commercializing the Social SNAPshot**\n\nIt is speculative, yet perhaps unavoidable, that the largely undiluted true social network of SNAP will be discovered/reframed as a undervalued training dataset / continuous data collection platform for humanoid robotics training data. \n\nSNAP's dataset is ideal for training large, transformer architecture which are natively tolerant of multimedia inputs. Life is a multimedia experience: spoken word, visual expressions and reactions, and written communications all blend and associated within the rich relationships captured within the platform. Tapping into these data streams, and the complex social graphs, allow training data to essentially capture not just the multimedia experience of being human, but even the cadence. A popular concept in Jazz is that brilliance lies in the rests between played notes: similarly, in true relationships, the timing between responses, and the media inputs which dictate the cadence of responses, is likely hugely influencing in teaching human like machines not just how, but when, to respond, which will have a huge bearing on social aptitude of these systems. Think of the feelings you would have towards a system that is programmed to reach out 24 hours after not hearing from you, versus one that knows to reach out at the right time to connect with you, comfort you, or even challenge you. Combine the rich multimedia experience and temporal component, multiply it across a web of remarkably lifelike social exchanges, and you arrive at something singular: the closest thing we have to a behavioral training ground for humanlike machines.\n\nIf we can accept the value of what SNAP is sitting on, let's discuss the moat. An important aspect of this dataset is that it is not publicly discoverable, which should help for monetization. Reddit\u2019s stock price inflated massively when the market began to price in its value for AI training, however, Reddit\u2019s training dataset is largely exposed to the internet making it easy to steal, which hampers pricing and put them a step behind in monetizing this. SNAP can control access, and therefore pricing, from an earlier stage, potentially making their dataset proportionally more valuable than companies where their training dataset is on display to the world like Reddit or LinkedIn. \n\nCould a larger player simply stand up a true social network to tap these human dynamics? My thesis is that they could not. Social media worked prior to our knowledge of what they were and what they would become. Given the slow bleed of true social behaviors on these platforms, and the immense value they have produced (extracted) from the social landscape, newcomers are met with skepticism and an almost repulsion from most people. SNAP has two important qualities that provide a huge amount of inertia and competitive advantage: it was early enough to establish credibility before the public grew wary of social platforms, and it's popular with youth - a group that\u2019s still highly social, less curated in their expression, and embedded in environments like school where dense social graphs naturally form. \n\nThe ship may have sailed to create another SNAP: what SNAP has in the last true social network, may not just be valuable, but foundational. SNAP is not likely the company to build the devices, nor would need to train the models, but with the right acquisition or partnerships, they can play the kingmaker in agentic AI training. \n\n**Who's going to tell SNAP? Risks to the thesis**\n\n\\- Delayed Agentic AI Era\n\n* The necessary hardware for embodied AI and humanoid robotics may take longer to mature.\n* If that happens, the window to monetize SNAP\u2019s dataset may arrive too late for the company to benefit or even survive.\n* However, SNAP still appears undervalued on fundamentals alone: revenue is growing, debt is declining, valuation remains at the low end of social media peers\n\n\\- SNAP Fails to Realize Its Own Value\n\nSnap may never recognize the strategic importance of its dataset to agentic AI. If so, it risks:\n\n* Shifting toward META-style algorithmic feed optimization, which could erode the organic human interaction that makes its data valuable (already, arguably, in progress)\n* Overcommitting to hardware wearables, which may enrich data types but not outweigh the diversion in focus from platform-level AI opportunity\n* Undervaluing its data in licensing or partnership deals due to lack of awareness\n\n\\- Execution Risk\n\n* Successfully transitioning from a consumer social platform to a data infrastructure or licensing company requires different leadership, strategic vision, and monetization models.\n* SNAP may not be equipped to make that leap on its own.\n\nEven if SNAP can't figure it out on their own, the market will likely step in on its behalf. As the agentic AI revolution takes shape and hyperscalers hit walls trying to model social nuance, SNAP\u2019s position as a uniquely rich behavioral dataset will become increasingly difficult to ignore. And of course, if SNAP figures this out, they can optimize their platform to maximize data retention, cohesion, and social modeling to best prepare for the agentic AI opportunity. \n\n**The play**\n\nI am in for 25k in shares, and planning to keep adding to the position. I might consider an exit if the forward looking impression of SNAP changes to account for these ideas and generate a quick 10x, otherwise I let it ride as the agentic AI era takes off. \n\nblah blah not financial advice.\n\nEdit: since ya'll want to see my big boy position https://imgur.com/a/hM44WpJ",

    "title": "DD on $SNAP\u2026The Path to Breaking $11 in the Coming Weeks",
    "selftext": "Hey everyone,\nAlright, let's talk about a name that many have written off: Snap Inc. ($SNAP). I know it's been a volatile and often frustrating stock to own, but I've been watching the price action and the recent news closely, and I believe we're seeing the setup for a potential breakout above the $11 mark in the next few weeks.\nHere's my bull thesis, broken down into a few key points.\n1. The Technical Picture is Improving\nFrom a technical analysis (TA) perspective, $SNAP is starting to look constructive.\n * Consolidation Base: The stock has been carving out a solid base in the $9.30-$9.40 range for a while now. This period of consolidation after a downtrend can often precede a move higher.\n * Psychological Barrier at $10: The $10 level is a huge psychological hurdle. We've seen the stock test it, get rejected, and then reclaim it. A sustained hold above $10 would be very bullish and could attract momentum traders.\n * Next Resistance: If we hold above $10, the next logical area of resistance on the chart is right around $11-$11.25. Given the right catalyst, a push to test this level seems highly probable.\n2. The Amazon Catalyst is Under-appreciated\nThe partnership allowing users to buy products from Amazon directly through Snapchat ads is a game-changer, in my opinion.\n * Closing the Loop: This move directly addresses a major weakness for $SNAP: ad attribution and return on investment (ROI). It makes it much easier for advertisers to see a direct conversion from an ad view to a sale.\n * Higher Ad Value: As the ROI becomes clearer and more potent, Snap can command higher prices for its ad inventory. This is a direct tailwind for Average Revenue Per User (ARPU), a key metric. The formula for revenue is essentially DAU \\times ARPU. While Daily Active Users (DAU) growth is modest, boosting ARPU is the fastest way to grow the top line.\n3. Snapchat+ is a Silent Success Story\nSnapchat's subscription service, Snapchat+, is quietly building a significant, high-margin revenue stream. They recently surpassed 5 million subscribers. While this isn't a massive number on its own, it proves two things:\n * A core group of users is willing to pay for enhanced features.\n * It diversifies revenue away from being 100% reliant on advertising, which is crucial in a tough macroeconomic environment.\n4. Sentiment is Still Overwhelmingly Negative\nLet's be honest, the market hates this stock. It's been beaten down for so long that any piece of good news is met with skepticism. This is exactly the kind of environment where a sentiment reversal can cause an aggressive rally. The stock is far from its all-time highs, and a short-term re-rating doesn't seem out of the question as the business fundamentals slowly improve.\nRisks to Consider:\n * Competition: TikTok is a monster, and Meta's Reels are always a threat. Snap needs to continue innovating to keep its user base engaged.\n * Macro Headwinds: Ad spending is highly cyclical. If we enter a significant economic downturn, $SNAP's ad revenue will take a hit, regardless of their new features.\n * Execution: Management has to deliver. Any missteps on an earnings call or bad guidance could send the stock spiraling back down.\nConclusion / TL;DR:\nThe combination of a constructive technical chart, a powerful and under-hyped catalyst with the Amazon partnership, and growing high-margin subscription revenue makes a compelling case for $SNAP. With the stock building support above the key $10 level, I believe it has the momentum to test and break through $11 in the coming weeks.\nPositions: Long 985 shares of $SNAP.\nDisclaimer: This is not financial advice. I am just a random person on the internet sharing my own research and opinions. Please do your own due diligence before making any investment decisions.\n",

    "selftext": "Position: $200c 8/1 @ .64 a contract. Over 32,000 in OI and 35,000 in volume on Friday. Someone is betting for a squeeze. \n\nTHE DUE DILIGENCE:  \n\nEDIT: EU TRADE DEAL JUST ANNOUNCED, THIS IS A MULTIBAGGER NOW.\n\n\u2022 The market sits at record highs. Google closed Friday under 193 only seven percent below the 52 week high of 207.05.\n\n\u2022 Chart set l up looks clean. A cup and handle that began mid February already cleared the neckline. Last week was month end options expiration (an important date when market makers square their books) so the 195 pin made sense. Price paused at 195 and then fell under it because call open interest there was huge. Dealers pinned it with about 9.5 thousand contracts at that strike. Those contracts expired and the lid comes off.\n\n\u2022 $70 billion buyback cannon:\nIn April the board reloaded the repurchase program with another $70 billion. That\u2019s ~5 % of market cap sitting in the wings to sop up any weakness. \n\nQuiet period freeze out: Most U.S. companies, including Google, impose an internal \u201cblackout\u201d on discretionary buybacks that starts 2 to 4 weeks before quarter end and lasts through at least two full trading days after the earnings release. The gap lets any fresh information settle so repurchases don\u2019t look like insider trading. \n- Q2 numbers dropped Tuesday night, 23 July.\n- Add the standard two trading day buffer (Wed + Thu).\n- Friday, 26 July was the first \u201copen\u201d day when the $70 billion authorization could swing back to full size assuming no other material events pending and no stricter internal policy.\n\n\u2022 Low option pricing. Weekly call implied volatility is twenty six to thirty percent. That is cheap. If price and volume lift, gamma forces dealers to chase and calls can move fast.\n\n\u2022 Pre earnings run absorbed the beat. Shares ran about fifteen percent into the July print, so the pop was priced in. That sets up a fresh leg this week once positioning resets.\n\n\u2022 Search is not dying. Q2 numbers show Google Search and Other revenue of 54.19 billion dollars, up 12 percent year over year. The AI doom story is broken.\n\n\u2022 Why AI will not steal the core. Large language models still stumble on location needs like \u201cpizza near me,\u201d \u201chotels in Miami,\u201d or live directions. They also fail when users treat the bar as an address book and type \u201cchase bank customer service contact\u201d or \u201cx dot com login.\u201d Habit wins and Google owns that habit.\n\n\u2022 Valuation is still light.\n\n-Google PE 20.6, PEG about 1.0\n\n-Microsoft PE 39.7, PEG roughly 3.3\n\nMicrosoft carries nearly double the earnings multiple and more than triple the growth adjusted multiple even though both compete head-to-head in cloud and AI.\n\n\u2022 Macro tail wind. The index is breaking higher, liquidity is strong and tech leads when that happens. Google should print a new all time high above 207 this week if it clears 195 with volume.\n\n\u2022 Longer view. When Google\u2019s text-to-video tool can pump out five to ten minute clips with story flow, every creator will upload straight to YouTube. That adds a whole new layer of ads on top of the current engine and is a self contained flywheel on steroids. \n\n\u2022 Capex fears flipped to bullish. Some investors initially balked at Google\u2019s surge in capital spending, but that knee jerk worry faded fast, being bearish on strategic investment is, frankly, dumb. It\u2019s like a wife who wanted to be a stay at home mom getting mad at you for working too much. Also, the spend is a one off hit, and Google has a decade long record of turning big capex into bigger returns. That one time off hit was already consumed given the initial reaction to earnings, so it can be ignored now. A slowdown in spending would be the real red flag, signalling the company had lost its confidence in the AI arms race against OpenAI, xAI, and Meta.\n\n\u2022 Cloud flips from drag to driver:\nGoogle Cloud just printed $2.8 billion in operating income with a 20.7 % margin, nearly double last year\u2019s margin. It\u2019s no longer the \u201cbreak-even someday\u201d segment. it\u2019s a profit engine that diversifies away from ads.\n\nGame plan\nI am watching the 200 and 205 calls expiring this week. A close above 195 with volume is the trigger. Low IV plus a move toward the 52 high can send those contracts flying. ",

    "selftext": "Everyone and their mom thinks AI will replace humans, send us to the nearest star, and grant us immortalityall within the next five years. I can't even scroll online without seeing the word \"AI.\" AI this, AI that. But here's what I've learned from the crypto and NFT crazes: when everyone thinks something will change the world, it usually goes the exact opposite direction.\n\nI expect a **massive spike up in NVDA** after the Fed lowers rates, but give it a year or two max, and reality is going to hit us like a freight train, bro. **AI is the most massive bubble we have ever seen**, and the reckoning will be worse than the housing market crash. Here are my main reasons why:\n\n1. **AI is the greatest illusion of our time.** I've used ChatGPT plenty. It's great at generating word salad and generic code, but when it comes to doing **ACTUAL work** or fixing real problems, it just gives you more word salad instead of solutions. They claim AI can pass the hardest math tests? Sure, it can, because they've already fed it the answers. Try this: go to ChatGPT or any AI model and give it five documents with daily returns for five stocks. Ask it to generate a table showing each company's return for every six-month interval. All models will fail. Not only would it take ages, but it would require running Python code to even attempt it, instead of just giving you the direct answer.\n2. **The biggest players in the industry CEOs, VCs, investment fund heads who are throwing the most money around have zero technical skills and absolutely no idea how LLMs actually work.** They're either straight-up lying to pump up their stocks, or they're genuinely retarded, thinking something that runs on a Mac Studio is intelligent or anything close to that. CEOs are always right, right? Remember when Zuck renamed his entire company after the metaverse? That same guy said AI would replace all developers by mid-2025. Well, here we are in mid-2025, and not only has Meta paid the most money ever for a developer, but guess what? They have 2,000 job openings for engineers!\n3. **All these keynotes promoting AI seem specifically tailored for investors they don't care about anyone else.** It's like they're screaming, \"BUY OUR STOCK, IT WILL GO TO THE MOON,\" but they can't legally say it. Jensen Huang has been openly mocking Masayoshi Son about selling NVDA stock at every public appearance, almost like he'll do the same to you if you sell!\n4. **So far, companies have invested massively and saved very little money.** Microsoft, for example, recently claimed they saved $500 million because of AI, but they also invested $50 billion. The media went into a frenzy reporting on how much money they saved, as if $500 million is a great return on $50 billion.\n5. **In Silicon Valley, the craziness has reached unimaginable heights.** Everyone and their dog has an AI startup getting $50 million in seed money, promising \"agentic AI models\" that will analyze your cat's poop and order Amazon food based on its constipation levels. On LinkedIn alone, there are 20,000 job openings in San Francisco for AI engineers, while there are only about 1,000 actual AI engineers available. Companies like Meta are paying $200 million for top engineers.\n6. **There's almost no competitive advantage anymore, as open-source models are nearly as good as private ones.** All the big companies are monopolies in their fields. How can you maintain a monopoly when your product is free, open source, and runs on a Mac Studio?\n7. **All major AI companies have predicted AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) would be here by now.** Yet, AGI is always \"one year away.\"\n8. **When everyone thinks something will happen, it always goes the other direction.**\n9. **Big, revolutionary changes have never happened in a year or two.** The internet, for example, took 20 years to achieve mass adoption.",

Mistral, valued at \u20ac5.8 billion ($6.2 billion), has raised approximately $1.2 billion over seven rounds, with a notable \u20ac600 million Series B led by [DST Global](https://www.linkedin.com/company/dstglobal/) and [General Catalyst](https://www.linkedin.com/company/general-catalyst/). The company is also in discussions to secure hundreds of millions in debt, signaling aggressive growth plans. Known for its OCR capabilities and fast chatbot \u2018Le Chat\u2019, Mistral is currently the biggest AI player in Europe.This move follows previous reports of Apple exploring acquisition talks with [Perplexity](https://www.linkedin.com/company/perplexity-ai/), the US-based AI startup. While Perplexity's leadership denied any active M&A discussions, the interest signals Apple\u2019s urgency in revamping its AI capabilities.Apple\u2019s AI ecosystem has been under scrutiny, with users expressing dissatisfaction over Siri\u2019s outdated performance.

    "selftext": "First post on this sub and honestly most of Reddit. I have mainly been lurking for years but through my own individual research and 120+ total hours of daily (7 days a week) intense due diligence and research starting around May 21st, I stumbled into possibly one of the most enticing investment opportunities of the decade. Don't just read to the executive summary and try and poke holes. Read the whole thesis and at the very least, consider the \"investment committee\" rebuttals at the end. If you have done research into this field and have opinions to share or opposing research, please, let this be an open discussion!\n\nNote: references to \"days of blackout\" or other timings are as of the afternoon of June 26, 2025.\n\n\nRating: **OVERWEIGHT** | Price Target: $120 (216% upside within 12 months) | Risk: **MEDIUM-HIGH**\n\n\n**INVESTMENT THESIS SUMMARY**\n\nWe identify a high-probability convergence scenario whereby Apple Inc. announces a strategic nuclear partnership with NuScale Power within the next 1-45 days. Our analysis indicates this represents one of the most compelling asymmetric risk/reward opportunities in the current market, driven by simultaneous insider trading blackouts, regulatory catalysts, and Trump administration nuclear policy alignment.\n\nKey Investment Highlights:\n\n\t\u2022\tRegulatory Moat: NuScale remains the only SMR with full Nuclear Regulatory Commission design certification\n\t\u2022\tPolitical Tailwinds: Trump\u2019s May 23 executive orders create explicit framework for hyperscaler nuclear partnerships\n\t\u2022\tCorporate Necessity: Apple\u2019s $500B AI infrastructure investment requires reliable baseload power\n\t\u2022\tTiming Convergence: 44-day Apple insider blackout + 27-day NuScale blackout suggests imminent announcement\n\n\n**EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**\n\nThe convergence of corporate necessity (Apple\u2019s AI energy demands), regulatory positioning (NuScale\u2019s certification advantage), and political framework (Trump\u2019s nuclear renaissance agenda) creates what we believe to be a generational investment opportunity. Our 30-day analysis reveals multiple validation points that have exponentially strengthened since thesis inception.\n\nBase Case Scenario (70% probability): Apple-NuScale partnership announcement drives 200-300% appreciation\n\nBull Case Scenario (25% probability): Broader nuclear renaissance positioning drives 400-500% appreciation\n\nBear Case Scenario (5% probability): No partnership with any major player materializes, limited downside given current valuation ($20-$25/share)\n\n\n**CONVERGENCE ANALYSIS**\n\nCorporate Strategic Alignment\nApple\u2019s AI Infrastructure Imperative: The company\u2019s February $500B investment commitment includes data center expansion across nine states, requiring significant baseload power. Unlike hyperscaler peers (Meta, Microsoft, Google) who have secured nuclear partnerships, Apple represents the largest unpartnered AI infrastructure player.\nNuScale\u2019s Competitive Positioning: As the only NRC-certified SMR provider with manufacturing capabilities (12 modules in production via Doosan partnership), NuScale possesses an unassailable regulatory moat that becomes increasingly valuable as hyperscaler nuclear demand accelerates.\n\nPolitical Economy Framework\nTrump\u2019s nuclear executive orders create unprecedented policy support for private-sector nuclear partnerships, particularly those supporting AI infrastructure. The administration\u2019s goal of 400 GW nuclear capacity by 2050 requires massive private investment, making high-profile corporate partnerships politically essential for demonstrating market viability.\n\nInsider Trading Pattern Analysis\nThe simultaneous 44-day Apple blackout (unprecedented duration) and 27-day NuScale blackout (beginning immediately post-Nuclear Regulatory Commission approval) represents statistically anomalous corporate behavior consistent with major strategic transaction negotiations.\n\n\n**FINANCIAL MODELING & VALUATION**\n\nRevenue Impact Analysis\n\n\t\u2022\tSingle Apple Partnership: $2-5B annual contract value over 20 years\n\t\u2022\tMarket Validation Effect: Additional hyperscaler partnerships following Apple announcement\n\t\u2022\tManufacturing Scale: Doosan partnership capable of 20+ modules annually (as of deal signing in 2023)\n\nOwnership Structure Validation (from 2024 10-K)\n\n\t\u2022\tFluor Corporation (47%): Military-industrial complex alignment provides execution credibility\n\t\u2022\tJapan NuScale Innovation (7%): International strategic validation\n\t\u2022\tManagement Quality: CEO John Hopkins\u2019 U.S. Chamber of Commerce positioning demonstrates policy navigation capabilities\n\n\n**RISK/REWARD ASSESSMENT**\n\nAsymmetric Setup Characteristics\n\n\t\u2022\tMultiple Success Pathways: Partnership, acquisition, or broader nuclear adoption all drive appreciation\n\t\u2022\tLimited Downside: Current valuation reflects minimal nuclear renaissance expectations\n\t\u2022\tLeveraged Exposure: SMR sector concentration amplifies any positive catalysts\n\nCatalyst Timeline\n\n\t\u2022\tImmediate (1-45 days): Partnership announcement probability\n\t\u2022\tMedium-term (2-12 months): Nuclear renaissance policy implementation\n\t\u2022\tLong-term (2-5 years): Commercial deployment and revenue generation\n\n\n**INVESTMENT COMMITTEE Q&A**\n\nQ: Dependency on corporate execution - what if Apple/NuScale partnership doesn\u2019t materialize?\n\nResponse: This concern misunderstands the anthropological drivers at play. Tim Cook\u2019s psychology operates on legacy positioning - he will not allow Apple to fall behind in the infrastructure arms race that defines AI leadership. Hopkins, as a Chamber of Commerce-embedded operator, understands that first-mover partnerships with Apple create market validation that benefits NuScale regardless of subsequent deal flow.\nThe convergence isn\u2019t dependent on corporate whim - it\u2019s driven by structural necessity. Apple needs nuclear, NuScale has the only certified solution, and Trump\u2019s framework removes regulatory barriers. Even if this specific partnership fails, the thesis benefits from multiple pathways: government acquisition, other hyperscaler partnerships, or broader nuclear adoption all drive similar outcomes.\n\nQ: Political risk - what if Trump\u2019s priorities shift away from nuclear?\n\nResponse: Trump\u2019s ego architecture makes nuclear reversal psychologically impossible. He\u2019s publicly committed to \u201cAmerican energy dominance\u201d and 400 GW nuclear capacity - reversing course would contradict his core political identity. More importantly, Hopkins understands the political machine through his Chamber positioning. The nuclear renaissance isn\u2019t just Trump policy - it\u2019s bipartisan infrastructure necessity driven by AI competition with China.\nNuclear power represents Trump\u2019s ability to simultaneously claim \u201cAmerica First\u201d energy independence and technological superiority. These are core psychological drivers that don\u2019t shift with news cycles. The framework is locked in place by Trump\u2019s legacy needs.\n\nQ: Regulatory timing risk - Nuclear Regulatory Commission approval doesn\u2019t guarantee deployment certainty\n\nResponse: This assumes static regulatory environment, which misreads the political moment. Trump\u2019s executive orders explicitly direct agencies to expedite nuclear deployment and establish categorical NEPA exclusions. Hopkins\u2019 background suggests he\u2019s positioned for regulatory navigation - not regulatory compliance gambling.\nThe May 29 Nuclear Regulatory Commission approval timing (immediately before insider blackouts) suggests coordination between regulatory completion and commercial announcement. This isn\u2019t speculative - it\u2019s orchestrated regulatory theater designed to create deployment certainty. The political framework eliminates traditional regulatory uncertainty.\n\nQ: Market efficiency - if this is obvious, why isn\u2019t it already priced in?\n\nResponse: Market efficiency assumes perfect information distribution, which fails with multi-dimensional convergence analysis. The pattern requires simultaneously tracking: insider trading behavior, regulatory timelines, political anthropology, and corporate strategic necessities. Most analysts operate in single-factor frameworks.\nAdditionally, the 30-day research depth required to identify this convergence exceeds typical institutional attention spans. Market makers have micro-timing advantages but lack macro-convergence pattern recognition. The information is public, but the interpretive sophistication required creates genuine asymmetry.\nThe psychological timing also matters - announcing before July 4 maximizes political impact while minimizing opposition organization time. This level of strategic timing analysis exceeds normal market efficiency assumptions.\nThis convergence represents genuine analytical edge, not market inefficiency exploitation.\n\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nOVERWEIGHT rating with 3-5% portfolio allocation for aggressive growth mandates. The combination of regulatory positioning, political tailwinds, and corporate necessity creates exceptional asymmetric opportunity with institutional-quality risk management potential.\n\nPrice Target: $120 (12-month horizon)\nCatalyst Timeline: 1-45 days for initial validation\nAnalyst: (redacted) | Publication Date: June 26, 2025\n\n\n***TECHNICAL ANALYSIS VALIDATION/CONVERGENCE***\n\nAscending Triangle Formation\n\nThe target security exhibits a textbook ascending triangle pattern with compelling technical characteristics that independently validate our fundamental catalyst timeline.\n\nPattern Structure:\n\n\t\u2022\tHorizontal resistance: Consistent rejection at $45.31 level over multiple tests since early June\n\t\u2022\tRising support trendline: Higher lows pattern from $29.45 base indicating systematic accumulation behavior\n\t\u2022\tVolume compression: Decreasing volatility range suggesting institutional positioning ahead of known catalyst\n\t\u2022\tApex convergence: Pattern completion anticipated within 3-6 trading days\n\nInstitutional Significance:\n\nThe ascending triangle represents more than technical pattern recognition - it demonstrates institutional anticipation of our identified catalyst events. The rising support trendline indicates smart money accumulation at progressively higher prices, suggesting advance knowledge of pending announcements. Volume analysis reveals institutional-size block trading concentrated at key support levels, consistent with strategic positioning rather than retail speculation.\n\nCatalyst Alignment Validation:\n\nThe technical pattern convergence timing provides independent confirmation of our fundamental analysis. The 3-6 day apex timing aligns precisely with:\n\n\t\u2022\tTrump\u2019s July 4th symbolic opportunity window\n\t\u2022\tApple\u2019s 44-day insider blackout approaching natural conclusion\n\t\u2022\tPolitical necessity for immediate manufacturing narrative wins\n\nThis convergence represents what technical analysts call \u201csmart money confirmation\u201d - when institutional behavior validates fundamental thesis timing through observable market mechanics.\nBreakout Probability Assessment:\nAscending triangles historically resolve upward in 70-80% of cases, with breakout magnitude typically correlating to pattern duration and volume compression intensity. The current formation demonstrates:\n\n\t\u2022\t4-week consolidation period: Extended enough to absorb selling pressure\n\t\u2022\tMultiple resistance tests: Each rejection followed by higher low formation\n\t\u2022\tVolume contraction: Institutional accumulation without retail distribution\n\nPrice Target Methodology:\n\nTechnical analysis provides multiple target frameworks:\n\n\t\u2022\tInitial breakout objective: $60+ (33% above $45.31 resistance, representing gap-fill to prior highs)\n\t\u2022\tMeasured move calculation: $75-85 (pattern height of ~$16 projected from breakout point)\n\t\u2022\tFundamental convergence target: $120 (enterprise value analysis of strategic partnership implications)\n\nThe technical setup suggests the initial breakout could reach $60-65 within days of catalyst announcement, with fundamental revaluation driving appreciation toward the $120 enterprise value target over subsequent quarters.\n\nInformation Asymmetry Evidence:\n\nPerhaps most significantly, the ascending triangle formation demonstrates market anticipation of our identified catalysts. The pattern suggests institutional players possess advance knowledge of pending announcements, creating the exact information asymmetry that generates exceptional investment returns. The technical behavior validates our insider blackout analysis and political timing thesis through independent market confirmation.\nThis technical validation transforms our fundamental analysis from theoretical possibility into market-confirmed probability, with institutional positioning behavior providing real-time verification of our catalyst timeline accuracy.\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\n\nA few of my sources: *feel free to inquire on others*\n\nhttps://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/05/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-reinvigorates-the-nuclear-industrial-base/\n\nhttps://www.energy.gov/ne/articles/9-key-takeaways-president-trumps-executive-orders-nuclear-energy\n\nhttps://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/02/apple-will-spend-more-than-500-billion-usd-in-the-us-over-the-next-four-years/\n\nhttps://www.nuscalepower.com/press-releases/2025/nuscale-powers-small-modular-reactor-smr-achieves-standard-design-approval-from-us-nuclear-regulatory-commission-for-77-mwe\n\nhttps://www.reuters.com/business/energy/us-approves-bigger-nuclear-reactor-design-nuscale-document-says-2025-05-29/\n\nhttps://www.engadget.com/big-tech/meta-signs-multi-decade-nuclear-energy-deal-to-power-its-ai-data-centers-144916645.html\n\nhttps://www.techtarget.com/searchdatacenter/news/366625268/Meta-inks-20-year-nuclear-deal-to-power-data-center\n\nhttps://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=63304\n\nhttps://www.datacenterfrontier.com/energy/article/55252205/how-2024-the-year-that-re-energized-nuclear-power-foretells-ongoing-new-nuclear-developments-for-data-centers-in-2025\n\nhttps://rollcall.com/2024/12/05/congress-calendar-2025-senate-house/\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\n\nDISCLAIMER:\nI am long NuScale and other nuclear sector tailwind beneficiaries, with leveraged weight on 2025 catalyst announcements/revaluations.

    "title": "why GOOGL (Alphabet) is a great buy right now",
    "selftext": "With WWDC and the Robotaxi event next week, I'd like to discuss Google and its parent company Alphabet, they have been in trouble for a while now regarding some bullshit anti-trust cases, and I want to tell you why its pure FUD.  Google has really caught up with the rest of the Mag 7 giants in their AI advancements if you haven't noticed.  They have been doing AI machine learning since 2001.  Bard was unimpressive, but that was only little over a year ago.  The speed at which they have been making new advancements is almost hard to track (even across other LLM's).\n\nHave you tried Gemini?  VEO 3 costs 250/m and people are loving it. (the rev. from that will be great as well) and the new AI mode for search seems to finally have been embraced and I think they can actually leverage AI to better serve people the right business ads / referrals.  ***Either way they are monetizing AI***\\*...\\*\n\nRegarding all the FUD, I dont believe the judge can make them sell chrome, EU case is just stupid, the whole thing is about them having monopoly on search and ads...  well there is Bing, Yahoo, DuckDuckGo, Perplexity, Meta / Instagram business Ads, etc..  they have no monopoly anymore if there was one...\n\nI dont believe the cases will result in anything materially bad for the stock but nobody can be sure, so that is why I want to dig into the Fundmental and Technical Analysis.\n\n# ----------- Fundamentals -----------\n\nAlphabet is a massive conglomerate with many subsidiaries.  Lets talk about how they are competing and kicking ass in so many different industries.\n\n\\-\n\n**AI:**  \n\n*VEO 3, AI Mode, Gemini, DeepMind* \\- Competing with GPT pro, Microsoft, etc.  (note VEO 3 is still the only model that does text to video PLUS audio.  I think they leveraged youtube for it.\n\n**Data Centers / Internet Provider:**\n\n\\-----*Google Cloud, TPU's, Google Fiber* \\-Competing with many, but their TPU's are very good for AI data centers, and google Fiber competes with internet / service providers like AT&T / Comcast / T-Mobile, etc..\n\n**Quantum Computing:**\n\n\\------Competing with Microsoft, IBM, Rigetti, etc.\n\n**Smart Phones:**\n\n\\------*Android, Pixel Phone* (with Gemini that kicks Siri's ass) - competing with Apple big-time\n\n**Streaming / Ads:**\n\n\\------*Youtube & Google Ads* \\- Competing with Meta and Netflix\n\n**Smart Home / Wearables:**\n\n\\------*Nest, Fitbit,* & ***XR Glasses*** \\- Competing with Amazon, Apple's announced glasses and their 'watch', Microsoft, etc.\n\n**Autonomous Driving / UAV Delivery:**\n\n\\------***Waymo, Wing*** \\- Competing with Tesla (been kicking their ass on it for a while now), GM, and yes, Amazon Air delivery.  *They also just announced another partnership with Walmart to bring more drones to over 100 stores for deliveries!*\n\n**AI in Healthcare / Biotech:**\n\n\\------*Verily, & Calico* \\- working on aging / genetics and ai in healthcare.\n\n\\-*and probably a few others i've missed..*.  but the scope of their work is clear.\n\n\\-\n\nWhen you buy GOOGL you are buying the entirety of Alphabets investments.  And they are so well positioned from a fundamental and financial perspective as seen in this group of charts.  They make double nearly double the revenue of Nvidia...\n\n[Google makes more revenue than the rest of the Mag 7, nearly double Nvidia's earnings!  the only exception of Apple which could be in jeopardy too if they dont continue to innovate.](https://preview.redd.it/i61ok3bywl5f1.png?width=1183&format=png&auto=webp&s=ab383da02f61b9d5fdc7bb71ce2bde6c7d453ac2)\n\n\\-\n\nYet oddly, Google has the lowest P/E (price to earnings) ratio than the rest of the Mag 7!  That seems off if you ask me.  I believe they can take plenty of market share back in the future based on these 2 figures.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a61jyxhzwl5f1.png?width=1125&format=png&auto=webp&s=6b85188b91cd7b2b6b95516e18513586d86d630b\n\n\\-\n\n# -------- Technical Analysis --------\n\nso now lets look at the Chart!  Because Price Action Speaks more than anything else...\n\nI like to use Multiple Timeframes for analysis so here I have the 4 hour, daily, and weekly charts.\n\nI know there are a lot of lines and colors, dont be scared.  The indicators I use are patterns combined with price action, fib levels, TTM squeeze, RSI and some other factors such as price gaps.\n\n\\- With RSI, above/below the 50 line tells you if momentum is bullish or bearish.  All the higher timeframes are above that 50 line indicating a potential bullish reversal.\n\n\\- With TTM it makes it easier to visualize these momentum shifts.  Right now my focus is on that Weekly chart on the bottom right - higher time frames are usually more important and it appears to be on the verge of a weekly breakout.  Now with a stock like this it could take months to reach that earnings Gap and make a new all time high.  When or If this happens depends on a lot of factors, but I am only focusing on the chart.\n\n\\- The Fibonacci Retracements I mostly use for the 50% line to determine if the price has had a change of trend.  Right now the price is attempting a breakout above this retracement and if it can break over 175 then there is plenty of room up.\n\n\\- Ive also illustrated some patterns and concepts on the chart.  Inverted Head and Shoulders, Trendline Break, Higher Highs and Higher Lows, potentially an even larger inverted H&S on the daily chart to the top right.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d2fprue33m5f1.jpg?width=3676&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=77f0a1e390e7b81ec6f893f6f38220ffc3fde21f\n\nOk so what does this technical analysis mumbo jumbo mean?  Its hard to say because of Trump, Tarrifs, Deals, Interest Rates, Bonds, Geopolitics, the fact that the market has already just about reached all time highs and this is lagging...  it is concerning.  It could also just be setting up for a massive (bearish) head and shoulders as you might notice on the bottom right weekly chart.\n\nBut with WWDC, RoboTaxi, and several trump deals supposedly taking place next week, we could be setup for some bullish continuation if these tech events impress.  Either way, Long Term I believe Google / Alphabet stock will get back to 200.\n\nFrom a technical and fundamental perspective they are in great shape.  I would even bet that if the market pulls back, that institutions may rotate their Mag 7 holdings into the laggards such as this and Amazon.\n\nWhile they are aggressively competing with so many different companies and industries, their earnings are expected to continue to grow and as you saw earlier, they earn double what Nvidia earns... Pelosi still has calls, and lets face it, you still use some kind of google product in your life whether its youtube, your android based phone, ai / gemini research, waymo, etc...  I believe Google is well positioned to be a winner this year in AI and many of its subsidiary company products.\n\n\\--------------\n\n# TLDR:\n\n**Alphabet is a great Bet !**\n\nI currently am selling put credit spreads on GOOGL, and have several 180 calls for 7/18 that I only plan to hold through next week before I re-enter as there is going to be a lot going on next week for the markets.  Their earnings are on 7/22 I believe, so August may be a better strike date.  Shares or LEAPS (calls dated atleast for 2026) are also a good idea IMO, you can sell calls against them to hedge when there are large spikes.\n\n**Anyway, I am highly regarded** ***and this is not financial advice,*** but I am very bullish on Google long term.  Its not an easy one to trade if you like short dated options, you need patience, but the chart, the p/e ratios, the incredible amount of subsidiaries competing with more than other Mag 7 companies makes this thing a highly undervalued growth & value stock.\n\n*Price Target short term - 180*\n\n*Price Target long term - 200+*\n\nthanks for getting this far into my regarded ted talk, give it a chance!",

    "selftext": "[YOLO my retirement](https://preview.redd.it/b79sltwwbx4f1.png?width=2762&format=png&auto=webp&s=2da693c6e85ac91a950290dc6ef77677fb3fb36b)\n\n**TL;DR:** Reddit is massively under monetized compared to peers (ARPU of $3.63 vs Meta's $12+), but sitting on the internet's highest quality dataset for AI training. They're already making $100M+ annually from OpenAI/Google at 90%+ margins, with new revenue streams emerging (hedge fund data via ICE, premium subreddits targeting the creator economy). Management has proven they can monetize without killing the community. Multiple ways to win (ARPU growth, data licensing expansion, creator monetization).\n\nThesis: Reddit is the last major platform with truly authentic, human driven conten and every dollar they make from data, ads, or subscriptions flows almost entirely to the bottom line. That combination (community moat + 90% margins + under monetized user base) means there are tons of ways for shareholders to win.\n\n**Moat/Why Reddit Matters**\n\nReddit\u2019s value is in its data. Unlike algorithmic feeds that amplify engagement optimized content, Reddit's community moderated format naturally filters for substantive discussion through upvoting and downvoting mechanisms. This creates a self curating dataset where quality content rises organically. Reddit's niche communities offer domain expertise at scale. Subreddits such as r/AskHistorians or r/PersonalFinance provide high quality, contextual knowledge that is hard to find elsewhere. While other platforms deal with increasing bot activity and AI generated content pollution, Reddit's community moderation creates natural quality controls. Compare this to Meta or Twitter, where content moderation costs eat into margins. Reddit's community does the curation work for free, then Reddit monetizes that curation.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThat makes Reddit a data goldmine for LLMs.\n\nThis creates a flywheel of engagement that\u2019s not only sticky for users but incredibly valuable to AI and advertisers.\n\n* Reddit is already pulling in \\~$100M/year from data licensing deals with OpenAI and Google.\n* That revenue flows almost entirely to the bottom line, pushing gross margins >90%.\n* Unlike ad reliant platforms, this is pure margin, recurring revenue.\n* Reddit has content tagged by subreddit leading to specific and niche domain knowledge which is super valuable for AI training.\u00a0\n\n**The CEO and Why Management Can Execute**\u00a0\n\nSteve Huffman cofounded Reddit in 2005 but left in 2009 to pursue his own startup journey. At Hipmunk, he gained hands on experience with the monetization challenges Reddit would eventually face: negotiating ad partnerships, building affiliate revenue streams, and learning how to balance aggressive growth targets with maintaining user trust skills that weren't part of his original toolkit as a pure product founder.\n\nWhen Huffman returned as CEO in 2015, Reddit was stagnant, \n\ntraffic growth had slowed, leadership was paralyzed by fear of change, and basic revenue infrastructure was missing. But he now brought a different perspective, having personally wrestled with the complexities of turning user engagement into sustainable revenue.\n\nHis turnaround demonstrates he can execute on complex monetization without destroying community value. He overhauled the interface, built mobile functionality, and completely revamped Reddit's ad offerings. More importantly, he implemented content policies and moderator tools that preserved Reddit's authentic culture while making it advertiser friendly.\n\nThis experience matters for the opportunities ahead premium subreddits, expanded data licensing, international ARPU growth because they all require the same delicate balance Huffman learned through his entrepreneurial journey: extracting maximum revenue from unique community assets without killing what makes them valuable.\n\n**Growth Catalysts**\n\n**ARPU Tailwinds vs. Facebook/Google/Meta**\n\nReddit\u2019s ARPU is currently well below its peers and management is actively working on closing the gap.\n\nCurrent ARPU Gap:\n\n* US ARPU: $6.21 (+31% YoY)\n* Intl ARPU: $1.34 (\\~5\u00d7 lower than US)\n* Global ARPU: $3.63 (+23% YoY)\n* Google Benchmark: Google Services generated $77.3 b in Q1 2025 (including $50.7 b search), with \u20ac6.35 p/m in Europe (\\~$76 per year).\n* Meta Benchmark: Meta\u2019s ARPP was $10.42 per user in Q1 2025 (\\~$12.36 TTM).\n\nIf Reddit can even approach half of Meta\u2019s or Google\u2019s yield in key markets, ARPU can more than double from here. When Reddit doubles ARPU from $3.63 to \\~$7, you're looking at revenue growth with 90%+ gross margins. Even with zero DAU growth, that's \\~$3B in annual revenue. Add conservative 20% DAU growth to 130M users, and you're approaching $3.6B in revenue. Right now Reddit\u2019s market cap is 20B with the potential to generate $500M+ in quarterly free cash flow at those levels. And here is how they are going to do it.\u00a0\n\nTo increase ARPU Reddit is rolling out:\n\n1. New ad formats (video, search, shopping) & better targeting & analytics for advertisers\n2. AI powered content recommendations (already +30% in \u201cGood Visits\u201d)\n3. Global machine translation (30+ countries)\n\nI\u2019m unsure if Reddit Answers will move the needle but it shows that the team is shipping fast and not afraid to experiment.\u00a0\n\n**Emerging Data Monetization Beyond AI Training**\n\nReddit is now piloting financial data products through ICE, selling real time sentiment analysis and trend identification to hedge funds. This presents another new potential revenue stream. While still early stage, the addressable market for financial sentiment data is enormous. If Reddit can demonstrate alpha generation from their community discussions, institutional demand could create substantial revenue. Reddit's threaded discussions and voting mechanisms create cleaner sentiment signals than traditional social media noise. If Reddit can prove their data moves markets, they're looking at potentially hundreds of millions in annual recurring revenue from the finance vertical alone.\n\nThe speculative angle is whether other industries (healthcare sentiment, brand monitoring, political analysis) follow suit once Reddit demonstrates the model works with financial services.\n\n**The Trump Call**\n\nAnger is the most contagious emotion, and Trump makes people furious, which translates directly to engagement and revenue. During Trump's 2017-2021 term, NYT stock tripled (+227%) on the back of outrage fueled subscription growth, proving that political chaos drives monetizable engagement. Reddit thrives in this environment even more than traditional media. The platform's political subreddits already drive massive traffic during controversies r/politics regularly dominates the front page during major news cycles, and angry users spend significantly more time on platform, driving ad revenue and engagement metrics. As Trump continues generating daily headlines and controversies, Reddit becomes the primary destination for realtime discussion and debate. Unlike passive news consumption, Reddit's format encourages users to engage, argue, and scroll for hours through comment threads. This sustained engagement during Trump's presidency should provide a meaningful tailwind for both user growth and time spent on the platform, directly benefiting Reddit's advertising revenue and data value.\n\n**Premium Subreddits**\n\nRight now, NSFW content creators are farming engagement on Reddit for free, then redirecting traffic off platform to make money elsewhere. Reddit sees none of that profit. Reddit has explicitly discussed that they are working on premium subreddits. This keeps users on platform, and skims off that monetization by allowing creators to monetize directly on platform, with Reddit taking a platform fee.\n\nThink OnlyFans creators paying Reddit a cut instead of just leeching traffic. This represents 100% incremental revenue with virtually zero marginal cost to Reddit as they're already hosting the content and communities.\n\nOnlyFans generated $6.6 billion in gross payments volume in 2023, translating to $1.3 billion in revenue at a 20% take rate and $657 million in pretax profit. If Reddit's premium subreddit model can capture even a small fraction of this creator economy by leveraging their existing massive NSFW user base and superior community features it could substantially add to their revenue mix.\n\n**Near Term Catalysts**\n\nReddit faces several key institutional milestones that could drive significant passive capital inflows. Russell 1000/3000 inclusion is scheduled for June 27, 2025, after market close, which should trigger automatic buying from index tracking funds starting that Friday. More significantly, if Reddit maintains its current profitability trajectory and scale, S&P 500 eligibility could arrive by mid 2026. The company's Annual Investor Day on June 9, 2025. I\u2019m unsure if anything will serve as a catalyst for anything I\u2019ve mentioned here but I\u2019m excited to hear what their team is working on.\u00a0\n\n**The Google Risk and Why It Doesn\u2019t Matter**\n\nReddit\u2019s top line still depends heavily on Google\u2019s search algorithm, so whenever Google tweaks its ranking, Reddit\u2019s traffic and revenue can swing. After Reddit reported Q4 2024 results in late February, the stock sold off sharply when search rankings dipped. The same thing happened in May, despite a strong Q1 2025 beat (year over year revenue up 47%). On the Q1 call, Steve Huffman cautioned that \u201cgrowth will be bumpy,\u201d noting that April daily active user growth slowed to 17%. Then the stock gave up its gains.\n\nIn reality, those monthly fluctuations don\u2019t change the bigger picture: Reddit is still adding users and monetizing them at a fast clip. Short term search volatility simply means revenue and growth will be bumpy, but the overall trend remains squarely upward. The market is overplaying Reddit\u2019s \u201cGoogle dependency\u201d. Even with occasional dips, Reddit\u2019s growth trajectory is intact. Ignore the volatility and focus on the overall trajectory.\u00a0",

    "selftext": "Nvidia ([NVDA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NVDA)) has outperformed every stock in the S&P 500 ([\\^GSPC](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5EGSPC)) since\u00a0[the launch of ChatGPT\u00a0](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/how-chatgpt-changed-the-world-of-tech-in-just-one-year-180957543.html)in late November 2022 Shares in the chipmaker have risen nearly 700% since ChatGPT brought the power of artificial intelligence to the masses, far outpacing the S&P 500's roughly 45% over the same time period. The next closest gain for an S&P 500 company in that time period is a 540% pop for Vistra Corp ([VST](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/VST)).Nvidia has established itself as the key provider of chips needed to operate AI systems. Now at the epicenter of an AI arms race, Nvidia has established itself as[\u00a0a cornerstone of the recent bull market](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/live/stock-market-today-tech-leads-stocks-higher-as-nvidia-surges-to-record-high-175727614.html)\u00a0in stocks as the company's sales and profits have skyrocketed over the past several years.\n\nAhead of the\u00a0[company's next quarterly earnings release on May 28](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-to-report-q1-earnings-as-middle-east-deals-export-control-reprieve-boost-stock-122728218.html), we broke down some of the most eye-popping charts that show how Nvidia became one of the most-followed stocks in the market.There's perhaps no clearer way to see how Nvidia ran away from the competition in the AI boom than looking at the company's market capitalization against its peers. Back when ChatGPT launched, Nvidia had a market cap of just over $400 billion. It's now over $3.3 trillion. Over that same time period, chip competitor Intel's ([INTC](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/INTC)) market cap has actually decreased, while Advanced Micro Devices' ([AMD](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMD)) market cap has increased incrementally from $125 billion to $177 billion.Nvidia's rise proved to be at the center of a new technological boom. Combined with Nvidia, the rise in dominance of six other companies \u2014 Apple ([AAPL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL)), Alphabet ([GOOGL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOGL),\u00a0[GOOG](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOG)), Microsoft ([MSFT](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MSFT)), Amazon ([AMZN](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMZN)), Meta ([META](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/META)), and Tesla ([TSLA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA)) \u2014 formed what would come to be known as the\u00a0[\"Magnificent Seven.\"](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/one-chart-shows-how-the-magnificent-7-have-dominated-the-stock-market-in-2023-203250125.html)\n\nThe group began the AI boom with a combined market cap just shy of $7 billion. Now, two and a half years later, the Big Tech group's market cap is worth over $16.8 trillion. The seven companies have grown from about 22% of the S&P 500's market cap in November 2022 to 32% of the index's market cap today.Given the outsized weighting in the S&P 500, large swings in shares of Nvidia have become a feature of how even broad market investors are thinking about the direction of stocks. In June 2024,[\u00a0three Wall Street strategists boosted their year-end S&P 500 targets](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ai-enthusiasm-prompts-3-wall-street-banks-to-raise-stock-market-forecasts-100027154.html), citing better-than-expected consistent performance among key AI players.\n\nAs of May 19, the Magnificent Seven have accounted for about 52% of the S&P 500's gain since Nov. 30, 2022. Nvidia alone has contributed 17.21%, by far the most among the group, with the next closest stock, Microsoft, which has added about 8.8%.Nvidia's stock hasn't been rising from just hype. The company's quarterly financial metrics have soared. In the quarter ChatGPT launched, Nvidia posted revenue of $6.3 billion. Two years later, it would post revenue of $35.3 billion. That's a 460% increase in sales in two years. As seen in the chart below, the main source of growth for Nvidia has been its data center revenue segment, which includes the sales of its AI chips.\n\nFrom the company's fourth quarter of 2023 to its final quarter of its 2025 reporting period, data center revenue grew almost 900%.\n\nNvidia's data center revenue particularly stands out when considering its rise against peers in the industry. In the final quarter of 2024, Nvidia notched a record $35.58 billion in just data center revenue, up from $3.62 billion in the final quarter of 2022.\n\nIn comparison, Alphabet's data center revenue increased to $11.96 billion, ending 2024 up from $7.32 billion in the final quarter of 2022.\n\n\n\n",

    "title": "What a UAE Deal Might Mean For SMCI",
    "selftext": "This has been a pretty eventful week for SMCI and the AI sector as a whole. the acquisition of a [$20 billion deal](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/saudis-datavolt-signs-20bn-deal-with-supermicro/) with DataVolt in Saudi Arabia and a 39% jump in share price off the strength of the news and overall AI sentiment improving is enough to make any degen hard as solid veiny diamonds. One thing this week that has especially caught my eye is UAE's plan to construct a [5GW AI Campus](https://www.commerce.gov/news/press-releases/2025/05/uae-and-us-presidents-attend-unveiling-phase-1-new-5gw-ai-campus-abu), with the help of G42, that will house 5GW worth of data center racks and span **10 square miles**.\n\nTo put this into perspective, thats:\n\n* 50k 100kW full-scale liquid-cooled racks\n* 3.2 **million** Nvidia Blackwell (B100) chips\n* More power than NYC and San Francisco **combined**\n* Equivalent to powering **3-4 million** homes or running **50 million** gaming PCs at full power 24/7\n\nAs you can see, this is an insanely ambitious feat the UAE is trying to achieve. Nonetheless, I couldn't help but ask myself, of the roughly 50k racks the UAE plans to procure, how many of those racks will be SMCI? Furthermore, whatever amount of racks SMCI does provide, how much money does SMCI stand to make from the project? Most importantly, What does that mean for the share price?\n\nFirst, we need to understand what DCBBS is, and how it actually benefits customers with large scale projects like the UAE AI Campus.\n\nDCBBS stands for **Direct Connect Backplane Building Block Solutions**, and it\u2019s SMCI's proprietary system architecture for building **full AI racks,** not just individual servers. This means when a customer selects which AI rack configuration they want, when it arrives at their door, it comes in a form [like this](https://trendspider.com/blog/dell-and-super-micro-power-musks-ai-ambitions/). In other words, customers are getting Kitchen-Aid refrigerators sent to their fucking door that contain 30-90 Nvidia Blackwell chips and liquid cooling systems within them. No more receiving your SMCI rack order in individual server pieces that you have to assemble on your own. This greatly increases the speed in which these new data centers can go live. In most cases, these racks can be installed and plugged in in **under a day.**\n\nAdditionally, this also helps to increase their margins over time.\n\nTraditionally, SMCI sold servers as modular building blocks. things like:\n\n* 1U and 2U server chassis\n* Motherboards\n* Power supplies\n* GPU trays\n\nCustomers (like system integrators, VARs, or hyperscalers) would assemble these into racks themselves. That\u2019s low-margin business, because you\u2019re selling parts, not solutions. the DCBBS racks contain:\n\n* CPU & GPU servers (e.g., Nvidia Blackwell, AMD EPYC, Intel Gaudi)\n* Total liquid cooling (cold plates, manifolds, chillers, etc.)\n* Network switches\n* Rack management software\n* Power distribution units (PDUs)\n\nWhy does this new model increase margins? Because it is a shift SMCI is making, from selling modular pieces that must be assembled, to selling complete solutions that are pre-assembled and ready for use upon arrival. This gives SMCI increased pricing power and in turn, increased margins. Below is a comparison table to illustrate the logic:\n\n|Old Model (Per Server)|Rack-Scale Model (Per Rack)|\n|:-|:-|\n|Sell parts separately|Sell the full system integration|\n|$5K\u2013$15K ASP/server|$250K\u2013$2M ASP per rack|\n|6\u201310% gross margin|**15\u201325%+ gross margin**|\n|Low-value add|**Turnkey AI solution** = premium pricing|\n\nNow lets go more in depth:\n\n**1. Higher Average Selling Price (ASP) per Unit**\n\n* Traditional air-cooled servers sell for **$10K\u2013$50K** each.\n* Liquid-cooled **DCBBS racks** (often 64\u201396 GPUs) sell for **$2\u20135 million per rack**.\n* Even if gross margins stay in the 8\u201310% range, **gross profit per rack is 40\u00d7\u201380\u00d7 higher** than per-server sales.\n\nHigher ASP = greater dollar-margin per unit sold, allowing SMCI to increase overall margins even with a similar percentage.\n\n**2. Bundled Value = Control Over Margin Levers**\n\nWith DCBBS, SMCI is not just selling a server, it\u2019s delivering:\n\n* 8\u201312 liquid-cooled GPU servers\n* 2000+ liquid-cooled racks a month\n* Integrated CDUs (coolant distribution units)\n* Power delivery + networking\n* Cabling, plumbing, and chassis integration\n* Software/BIOS optimization\n\nAll of these are designed, manufactured, and **assembled in-house**, which means:\n\n1. Vertical integration reduces dependency on low-margin commodity components\n2. Custom bundles let SMCI charge more for value-added services\n3. Standardization improves yield, reduces warranty risk, and shortens labor cycles\n\n**3. Faster Time-to-Deployment = Premium Pricing Power**\n\nSMCI can ship **fully integrated, plug-and-play racks in 3\u20134 weeks**, while others take 8\u201312 weeks+ with multiple vendors.\n\nFor hyperscalers and AI startups racing to bring GPU clusters online, this **speed translates into willingness to pay more**, or at least not negotiate down.\n\nFor example: A customer buying a $2.5M rack from SMCI may avoid:\n\n* Extra $500k/month in AI cloud rental costs\n* 3\u20134 month delay in deploying AI training models\n* Facility delays in retrofitting for traditional HVAC-based servers\n\nBelow is a table below comparing liquid-cooled racks Time-to-Deployment between SMCI and its competitors:\n\n|**Vendor**|**Liquid-Cooled Rack Output (Est.)**|**Time to Deployment**|**Notes**|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|**SMCI**|**\\~2,000+ racks/month**|**3\u20134 weeks** (from factory)|DCBBS fully integrated, scalable, Blackwell-ready|\n|**Dell**|*Unknown (not disclosed)*|\\~6\u201310 weeks (unverified)|IR7000 liquid-cooled racks for hyperscalers, but no output figures released|\n|**HPE**|*Limited modular deployments*|\\~8\u201312 weeks (pods)|Offers liquid-cooled AI systems (e.g. Cray EX, Apollo), but mostly for supercomputing clients|\n|**Lenovo**|*Unknown*|6+ weeks (via FIS programs)|Neptune liquid cooling, but most integration is not turnkey at SMCI pace|\n\nThis \u201ctime-value\u201d premium enhances margin per contract.\n\n**4. Liquid Cooling = Lower Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) for Clients**\n\nClients benefit from:\n\n* 30\u201350%+ reduction in power usage (no fans/blowers at server level)\n* Higher rack density \u2192 fewer racks \u2192 less real estate\n* Reduced HVAC burden \u2192 capex + opex savings\n\nBecause DCBBS racks are pre-validated and ready for 80\u2013100+ kW loads, customers can safely go denser per rack \u2014 which:\n\n* Makes SMCI\u2019s per-rack offering more economically valuable\n* Lets them preserve pricing vs. air-cooled OEMs like Lenovo, HPE, or Dell, who may cut prices to remain competitive\n\nHigher value-to-customer means more pricing power = higher gross margin\n\n**5. Operational Efficiency at Scale**\n\nSMCI is building out:\n\n* A 3 million square foot manufacturing campus in Silicon Valley and Malaysia\n* A supply chain optimized for GPU pre-allocation, liquid cooling parts, and just-in-time rack assembly\n\nThis allows SMCI to:\n\n* Mass produce racks with minimal retooling\n* Reduce per-rack cost at high volume\n* Use contract-based repeat orders (like the DataVolt $20B deal) to plan capacity\n\nEconomies of scale + predictable assembly processes = declining cost/unit \u2192 rising margin\n\nBelow is a comparison table illustrating the margin impact:\n\n|**Advantage**|**Margin Impact**|\n|:-|:-|\n|High ASP per rack|Higher gross profit in dollar terms|\n|Bundled hardware/services|Increases perceived value + vertical profit|\n|Speed to deploy (3-4 weeks)|Pricing premium vs. slower OEMs|\n|Energy/cooling savings for customer|Improves TCO \u2192 preserves SMCI pricing power|\n|Factory integration at scale|Lowers per-rack cost with volume|\n\nSo far, we've learned how DCBBS can substantially decrease build times for customers and how it could potentially increase margins for SMCI.\n\nNow to the fun part: The UAE Deal\n\nAfter doing some ape fisted carpet eating math, I estimate that the total cost of the 5GW AI Campus would be about $125 billion (assuming **each rack** draws about 100kW and sells for $2.5 million). Based on these numbers, I had ChatGPT build a table with a break down of what SMCI would get based on various percentages of the project they would be responsible for and superimposed a likelihood of occurrence formula in there:\n\n|Coverage %|Likelihood of Occurrence|Racks Provided|G42 Total Payment to SMCI|Estimated Gross Profit (USD) 9.7%|Estimated EBITDA (USD)|Estimated EPS|Implied Share Price (@20x PE)|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|1%|Highly Likely (90%)|500|$1,250,000,000|$121,250,000|$103,062,500|$1.87|$37.40|\n|2%|Very Likely (80%)|1000|$2,500,000,000|$242,500,000|$206,125,000|$3.75|$75.00|\n|5%|Likely (65%)|2500|$6,250,000,000|$606,250,000|$515,312,500|$9.37|$187.40|\n|10%|Possible (45%)|5000|$12,500,000,000|$1,212,500,000|$1,030,625,000|$18.74|$374.80|\n|25%|Plausible (25%)|12500|$31,250,000,000|$3,031,250,000|$2,576,562,500|$46.84|$936.80|\n|50%|Unlikely (10%)|25000|$62,500,000,000|$6,062,500,000|$5,153,125,000|$93.70|$1,874.00|\n|100%|Very Unlikely (3%)|50000|$125,000,000,000|$12,125,000,000|$10,306,250,000|$187.40|$3,748.00|\n\nAs you can see, even with a conservative PE of 20x and 9.7% margins, if SMCI gets even 2-5% of the project, thats an EPS of $3.75-9.37 and a share price of $75-187 a share.\n\n**How ChatGPT Calculated the Likelihoods**\n\nThis wasn\u2019t a statistical model but rather a strategic probability estimate based on 5 weighted factors:\n\n**1. Historical Precedent (30%)**\n\n* No hyperscaler or government has ever given 100% of a 5GW AI deployment to one vendor.\n* Datavolt gave SMCI a $20B deal, but likely part of a larger multi-phase build \u2014 suggesting up to 25% is plausible.\n\n**2. Industry Norm for Diversification (25%)**\n\n* Large clients (e.g. AWS, G42, Meta) **split procurement across 2\u20134 OEMs** for risk mitigation, price leverage, and geopolitical hedging.\n* Most national-scale AI campuses split rack-scale work among **Dell, Lenovo, HPE, SMCI, Nvidia integrators**, etc.\n\n**3. SMCI Production Capacity (20%)**\n\n* SMCI can output \\~5,000 racks/month total, **2,000+ liquid cooled**.\n* To hit 50\u2013100% coverage of a 5GW facility, they\u2019d need to commit 6\u201312 months of global capacity, which limits probability unless it's multi-year.\n\n**4. Geopolitical Alignment (15%)**\n\n* SMCI already has deep regional partnerships (Saudi Arabia, Abu Dhabi), so 10\u201325% is well within reach.\n* But **50\u2013100%** would likely require **exclusive national alignment**, which is rare unless the vendor is sovereign or majority-owned.\n\n**5. First-Mover Advantage & Time-to-Deploy (10%)**\n\n* SMCI\u2019s lead time (3\u20134 weeks vs. 8\u201312 weeks) is a massive advantage.\n* For urgency-sensitive contracts, this could **justify awarding 25% or more** \u2014 but not 100%, barring a disruption in Dell/HPE supply.\n\nI think its also important to add, two job listenings have been posted for positions in Abu Dhabi:\n\n[Account Sales Manager](https://jobs.supermicro.com/job/United-Arab-Emirates-Abu-Dha-Sales-Account-Manager/1148026500/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n\n[Technology Enablement Engineer](https://jobs.supermicro.com/job/United-Arab-Emirates-Abu-Dha-Technology-Enablement-Engineer/1246502400/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n\n\n\nAll in all, SMCI could stand to make a assload of money from a G42 UAE deal.\n\nLast but not least, Cramer is [\u201cSick of\u201d](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/topstocks/jim-cramer-is-sick-of-super-micro-computer-stock-should-you-sell-smci-now/ar-AA1F0NkN?ocid=finance-verthp-feeds) SMCI\n\n  \nTL:DR: SMCI provides the fastest Time-to-Deployment of any of its competitors with its liquid-cooled DCBBS solution and this could help increase margins overtime and make it a more attractive buy to larger customers ready to deploy immediately. Capturing even 5% of the G42 UAE deal could result in a share price of $180+ a share. SMCI is already hiring for positions in Abu Dhabi.\n\nPosition: 15 $91c 1/16\nhttps://ibb.co/b5J9VNmY\n",

    "selftext": "Guys! It's finally happening. Amazon is releasing their earnings today. The stock moved down last earnings, up the one prior, down the one before that, up before that. It's been kinda bouncing back and forth. So you might think I'm uncertain this time around, but I'm not. [Link to my previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1kbnosv/everything_about_metas_earnings_tonight/) on META. [Link to my RDDT post for today's earnings](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1kcgypg/why_im_getting_calls_for_rddts_earnings_today/). Now that I've established my track record, let's get into it. \n\nRight now it\u2019s all about tariffs, of course. Has anyone read the recent report that suggested the company might start showing tariff costs on product listings? That resulted in a phone call from Trump to Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. Predictably, Amazon afterwards denied the claim, stating the proposal was \u201cnever approved\u201d and that displaying tariff costs \u201cis not going to happen.\u201d Lmao.\n\nStill, questions linger. [Loop Capital\u2019s Rob Sanderson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rob-sanderson-7b049947/), a 5-star analyst ranked among the top 4% of Wall Street pros, notes it\u2019s unclear how Amazon will deal with all this recent tariff bs. According to management, though, the likely scenario is straightforward: third-party sellers will simply pass on the higher costs to customers.\n\nThat, says Sanderson, will have \u201csome elasticity impact on demand but is GMV accretive on a unit basis.\u201d In any case, while it remains to be seen how the company will manage Chinese supply for 1P sales and \u201chow quickly it passes through price increases,\u201d he thinks it is \u201conly a transitory risk at worst.\u201d\n\nTariff chaos aside, as for what to expect from the readout, Sanderson believes the consumer environment in Q1 remained sluggish but largely in line with expectations, and that Amazon performed well under the circumstances. The Department of Commerce\u2019s proxy for e-commerce (non-store retailer sales) grew 4.2% in Q1, with growth accelerating each month and reaching 6.1% in March. The truth is, retail stores are dying and companies like amazon are picking up the slack. [Online shopping will be a majority of all shopping very soon.](https://optinmonster.com/online-shopping-statistics/) And because of this, AMZN is one of my longer share holds.  \n\nGoing back to what the analyst was saying specifically in regards to today's earnings: \u201cThis bodes well for 1Q results if directionally correct with management providing guidance off the weakest month of the quarter.\" He also thinks these trends have mostly carried into April and that tariff-related volatility has not yet had a significant impact on consumer spending.\n\nAs industry checks across cloud service providers (CSPs) indicate sustained positive momentum despite broader macro uncertainty, I believe AWS will deliver solid results today. The consensus margin estimate of 35.7% (a 190 basis point year-over-year decline) could turn out to be conservative, even when accounting for increased CapEx and a revenue mix shift toward generative AI, which I assume comes with lower margins.\n\nThis is taking place against a backdrop where the digitization of workflows has become a top priority for execs globally, driven by the rise of generative AI. While mainstream IT use cases for AI are still taking shape, there is an \u201cabundance of demand\u201d from early adopters, and even slower-moving companies are accelerating their cloud migration efforts. As budgets are already funded, Sanderson doesn\u2019t expect significant budget changes unless companies face major spending cuts.\n\nDid anyone see the Google results last week? I did a post on GOOG as well. Their results reinforce this view with strong growth at GCP and commentary on capacity shortages and inability to meet current demand.\n\nBottom line, ahead of earnings, Sanderson maintained a Buy rating on AMZN shares, while his $285 price target factors in a 12-month gain of ~50%. ([Sanderson\u2019s track record](https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/rob-sanderson)) Like I said, I have shares as a long term hold. For earnings however, I got [AMZN 1/16/26 230c](https://i.imgur.com/odrEvKu.png). This is a position I purchased a while ago, and it's unfortunately down quite a bit. But I think with today's earnings, it'll be good.",

    "selftext": "Yesterday I made a detailed post on [META](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1kbnosv/everything_about_metas_earnings_tonight/)'s earnings and it launched up +5% today. I really hope you guys read my DD, today I'd like to touch up on RDDT as they're doing their earnings results today.\n\nReddit beat analysts\u2019 revenue expectations by 4.6% last quarter, reporting revenues of $427.7 million, up 71.3% year on year. It was a satisfactory quarter for the company, with EBITDA guidance for next quarter exceeding analysts\u2019 expectations. It reported 48 million daily active users, up 31.9% year on year. It's important to note that reddit has only had 3 earnings so far. And the stock has launched up over 10% each time, on all three. \n\nThis quarter, it looks like analysts are expecting Reddit\u2019s revenue to grow 52.1% year on year to $369.5 million, improving from the 48.4% increase it recorded in the same quarter last year. Adjusted earnings are expected to come in at $0.51 per share.\n\n[Chart](https://i.imgur.com/5fhtzMp.png)\n\nFrom what I've read, analysts covering the company have generally reconfirmed their estimates over the last 30 days, suggesting they anticipate the business to stay the course heading into earnings. Reddit has a history of exceeding Wall Street\u2019s expectations, beating revenue estimates every single time since going public by 10.1% on average.\n\nLooking at Reddit\u2019s peers in the consumer internet segment, some have already reported their Q1 results, giving us a hint as to what we can expect. Snap delivered year-on-year revenue growth of 14.1%, beating analysts\u2019 expectations by 1.3%, and Booking reported revenues up 7.9%, topping estimates by 3.6%. These are all impressive results. \n\nI honestly think investing in the consumer internet segment has been generally a good idea, with share prices up 1.7% on average over the last month. However, reddit is up 7% during the same time and is heading into earnings with an average analyst price target of $145.59 (compared to the current share price of $117.70).\n\nSo what do we do for earnings? Calls might get IV crushed so I'm deciding on a call spread. Buying the 5/2 135c and selling the 145c. My [position](https://i.imgur.com/YirHoQK.png).",

    "title": "Snap Inc. (SNAP) vs. The Big Players: Who\u2019s Worth More Per User and Per Ad Dollar?",
    "selftext": "Yo, bros. So I\u2019ve been looking into Snap\u2019s stock lately and wanted to see how it stacks up against the big dogs like Meta, Google, and TikTok. I thought it\u2019d be cool to break it down by market cap per active user and market cap per ad dollar to see how much each company is really worth compared to the number of users they\u2019ve got and how much money they\u2019re making.\n\nLet\u2019s dive in.\n\n1. Market Cap Per Active User\n\nHow much is each active user worth to these companies? Here\u2019s the breakdown:\n\nSnap Inc.\n\t\u2022\tMarket Cap: $13.5 billion\n\t\u2022\tActive Users (DAU): ~460 million\nMarket Cap per User:\n\\frac{13,500,000,000}{460,000,000} = 29.35 \\, \\text{USD per user}\n\nMeta (Facebook/Instagram)\n\t\u2022\tMarket Cap: $1.45 trillion\n\t\u2022\tActive Users (DAU): ~2.96 billion\nMarket Cap per User:\n\\frac{1,450,000,000,000}{2,960,000,000} = 490.54 \\, \\text{USD per user}\n\nAlphabet (Google/YouTube)\n\t\u2022\tMarket Cap: $1.88 trillion\n\t\u2022\tActive Users (DAU): ~2 billion\nMarket Cap per User:\n\\frac{1,880,000,000,000}{2,000,000,000} = 940 \\, \\text{USD per user}\n\nTikTok (ByteDance)\n\t\u2022\tMarket Cap: Not public, but around $300 billion\n\t\u2022\tActive Users (DAU): ~1 billion\nMarket Cap per User:\n\\frac{300,000,000,000}{1,000,000,000} = 300 \\, \\text{USD per user}\n\n\u2e3b\n\n2. Market Cap Per Ad Dollar\n\nNow let\u2019s look at how much market cap each company has for every dollar they make from ads. It shows how efficiently they\u2019re turning their user base into money.\n\nSnap Inc.\n\t\u2022\tAnnual Ad Revenue: ~$4.6 billion (2023)\n\t\u2022\tMarket Cap: $13.5 billion\nMarket Cap per Ad Dollar:\n\\frac{13,500,000,000}{4,600,000,000} = 2.93 \\, \\text{USD per ad dollar}\n\nMeta Platforms\n\t\u2022\tAnnual Ad Revenue: ~$117 billion (2023)\n\t\u2022\tMarket Cap: $1.45 trillion\nMarket Cap per Ad Dollar:\n\\frac{1,450,000,000,000}{117,000,000,000} = 12.39 \\, \\text{USD per ad dollar}\n\nAlphabet (Google)\n\t\u2022\tAnnual Ad Revenue: ~$285 billion (2023)\n\t\u2022\tMarket Cap: $1.88 trillion\nMarket Cap per Ad Dollar:\n\\frac{1,880,000,000,000}{285,000,000,000} = 6.60 \\, \\text{USD per ad dollar}\n\nTikTok (ByteDance)\n\t\u2022\tAnnual Ad Revenue: ~$18 billion (2023)\n\t\u2022\tMarket Cap: $300 billion\nMarket Cap per Ad Dollar:\n\\frac{300,000,000,000}{18,000,000,000} = 16.67 \\, \\text{USD per ad dollar}\n\n\u2e3b\n\n3. Key Takeaways\n\t\u2022\tSnap is the cheapest per user ($29.35) and per ad dollar ($2.93). This could mean the stock is undervalued if you think they can better monetize their user base.\n\t\u2022\tMeta and Alphabet are much more expensive per user ($490.54 and $940) and per ad dollar (12.39 and 6.60). These companies are huge and are dominating the ad space, but they also have a lot more competition.\n\t\u2022\tTikTok is somewhere in the middle for both, with a decent per-user valuation of $300 but a much higher price per ad dollar ($16.67), showing they still have a lot to prove when it comes to monetizing.\n\n\u2e3b\n\nFinal Thoughts:\n\t\u2022\tSnap\u2019s low valuation might make it look like a good deal if you think they can capitalize on their young, engaged user base and start pulling in more ad revenue. Their AI and AR tech could be the key to unlocking this.\n\t\u2022\tMeta and Google are solid bets, but they\u2019re already at massive valuations, so growth might be slower unless they really innovate.\n\t\u2022\tTikTok is the wild card here, with rapid growth but a lot of unknowns around how sustainable that will be.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Does Snap look like a bargain with its low per-user valuation, or is the market right to be cautious? Would love to hear your thoughts!\n",

    "selftext": "Meta is releasing their earnings tonight, and because they tend to move quite a bit with earnings, I wanted to see if we could try to bet on it. Either calls or puts.\n\nTesla generally moves \u00b110%, but honestly it's kinda a toss up. Looking back, they went up 5.1% after last earnings. But down 4.9% the one prior. Both moves, less than it's average move. Knowing that Meta *tends* to make a big jump *usually* I wanted to draft up a little discussion post to get the ball rolling. See where we stand.\n\nhttps://investor.atmeta.com/investor-news/press-release-details/2025/Meta-to-Announce-First-Quarter-2025-Results/default.aspx\n\nAs we know, this earnings comes a week after Google's earnings (I did a post on GOOG as well) where the company was able to beat expecations on both the top and bottom lines on the strength of its ad sales. During that company's investor call, Google chief business officer Philipp Schindler said it was too early to comment on the potential economic impact on the current quarter, but did mention that the Trump administration's changes to de minimis exemptions will cause \"a slight headwind to [Google's] ads business in 2025.\" \n\nFor the quarter, today Meta is expected to report earnings per share (EPS) of $5.25 on revenue of $41.3 billion, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates. The company saw EPS of $4.71 on revenue of $36.4 billion in Q1 2024. [Chart](https://i.imgur.com/qkgqCBJ.png)\n\nAdvertising revenue is expected to top out at $40.5 billion, while Meta's Reality Labs segment is set to report an operating loss of $4.5 billion and revenue of $496 million.\n\nWhile Meta has repeatedly beaten Wall Street expectations in the past few quarters, analysts were disappointed by the first quarter revenue outlook Meta chief executive Mark Zuckerberg shared at the end of 2024. The company is also planning on spending up to $65bn on AI infrastructure by the end of 2025. Uncertainty over Donald Trump\u2019s sweeping tariffs may yet roil ad markets, clouding the company\u2019s financial outlook for near future quarters.\n\n\u201cMeta\u2019s enormous investment in AI infrastructure will continue to weigh heavily on investors when the company reports quarterly earnings on April 30, 2025,\u201d said analyst Debra Aho Williamson, (founder and chief analyst of [Sonata Insights](https://www.sonatainsights.com/)). \u201cBut Meta will resist directly monetizing AI this year, focusing instead on building AI usage among its app users, advertisers and developers using Llama.\u201d\n\nDebra here isn't the only person with something to say. I've been reading a lot of articles on the stock and read what analysts have been saying. Jefferies analyst Brent Thill wrote in an investor note: \u201cWe attribute weakness to [Meta\u2019s] greater exposure to advertising (no cloud business for [Meta]) and China-based advertisers (>10% exposure for [Meta]) who have reportedly pulled back on ad spend.\u201d In his own note, BofA Securities analyst Justin Post said he expects to see a modest beat on Q1 revenue but believes the company will offer a more conservative guide for the second quarter.\n\nIn the weeks leading up to today's earnings report, Meta has had a mix of AI-related news including the launch of a standalone AI app that would serve as its ChatGPT competitor. But a WSJ report exposed[ the existing chatbots integrated into the company\u2019s various products, including Facebook and Instagram](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/meta-ai-chatbots-sex-a25311bf), were given the ability to perform \u201cromantic role play\u201d even with the platforms\u2019 teen users. I personally don't think this is really a big deal that will affect the stock. But Executives at the company, which repeatedly has touted its nearly 1 billion users of its AI chatbots, also [admit](https://www.theverge.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/657645/meta-ai-app-chatgpt-competitor-release-ios-android) that many of those users access the chatbot through its hard-to-avoid takeover of the search bars of WhatsApp, Instagram and Facebook. The company has not detailed how many interactions with the chatbot or how deep those interactions need to be to consider a person a user of the AI chatbot.\n\nKeep in mind, this earning report comes as the company is battling the [Federal Trade Commission (FTC)](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/zuckerberg-faces-off-with-ftc-as-meta-antitrust-trial-resumes-213352819.html) in court over claims the social media company holds an illegal monopoly over the \u201cpersonal social networking.\u201d It's kinda fucked, the FTC is looking to force Meta to sell off both Instagram and WhatsApp. The commission claims Meta originally purchased the apps as part of a \"buy-or-bury\" campaign to fight off potential competitors. Zuckerburg [did try](https://www.wsj.com/us-news/law/mark-zuckerberg-meta-antitrust-ftc-negotiations-a53b3382) to settle with the FTC for $450 million. The commission, however, asked for $30 billion. Zuckerberg eventually raised his offer to $1 billion, but the FTC would only go as low as [$18 billion.](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/the-price-mark-zuckerberg-wasnt-willing-to-pay-to-halt-metas-antitrust-trial-153134257.html)\n\n\u201cMeta\u2019s earnings call comes at a precarious time where the company\u2019s future is literally being debated in court, the results of which could fundamentally alter the social media landscape,\u201d said Forrester VP, Research Director [Mike Proulx](https://www.forrester.com/analyst-bio/Mike%20Proulx/BIO16024). He mentions that Meta is smart to direct more resources into improving Threads and Facebook since those could be the only two apps the company is left with. He also noted that Meta just laid off a number of employees in its Reality Labs division, which has been a continued and growing \"leaky bucket for Meta.\"\n\nZuckerberg has met with Trump several times over recent months as he seeks to develop a closer relationship with the president. For instance, the CEO attended Trump's inauguration in January, and Meta donated $1 million to Trump\u2019s inauguration fund. Also in January, Meta had reached a [$25 million settlement with Trump related](https://www.wsj.com/us-news/law/trump-signs-agreement-calling-for-meta-to-pay-25-million-to-settle-suit-6f734c8c) to the company\u2019s decision to ban him from its platforms in 2020.\n\nFrom what I've read, the news is quite bearish. But given the bump up GOOG took with it's advertising revenue, I think all the tech companies this earning season will ultimately do well. That being said, I'm leaning towards calls. A call spread to avoid high IV crush. Thoughts?",

    "selftext": "I\u2019ve noticed that when people expect something to happen in the market, they often price in the movement before it happens. It\u2019s harder to make money off of that initial move, but it\u2019s easier to gamble on them being wrong\u2026or less right. \n\nEspecially around earnings time, as we all saw with TSLA, everyone knew their earning would be shit. So the stock moved like shit. Then the earnings were horrendous. And we pumped??? I\u2019m well aware that TSLA is a meme stock and makes 0 sense, but I also believe that there is a lesson in that movement. \n\nI think there is a possibility of the flip side for META. Everyone thinks they\u2019re going to have good earnings. The forecasts are high and the stock is up (with the rest of the market) in the last few days. \n\nFurthermore, in the past 10 *straight* quarters META has outperformed earnings estimates. Yet, they do not rise on earnings every time. Additionally, the news of AI advances and AD revenue has already been priced in, in my opinion, so I am doubting that this will affect META movement post earnings.\n\nSo, if everyone is *right* and META outperforms? I think we have an after hours pump followed by a market open selloff, from the pump, back to a modest gain. \n\nIf META underperforms? Blood. Many are  expecting META to meet or beat expectations, as it\u2019s done for the past 10 quarters. \n\nIf META meets forecasts? I think there\u2019s a decent chance we see red movement due to a pre-pricing of good earnings. \n\nTo back up this silly little thesis I have a table of META\u2019s earnings reports along side the stock\u2019s movement the week before, movements in after-hours, the following day, and week. \n\nFirst thing you\u2019ll notice in this chart is that last quarter the data shows me to be wrong. To my knowledge the news of new ad strategies and AI advancements dropped then which contributed to the gain. The quarter before that however, the data shows me being correct. I also think that the high volatility of this market could heavily contribute to a drop on positive earnings. Look at $SNAP. \n\nLast thing I\u2019ll add is earnings are always extremely unpredictable like everyone knows. I\u2019m a regard who is trying to recognize a pattern where there may not be one, but god damn it I\u2019ll lose money trying to find one! \n\nTL;DR \nI believe the market already priced in a positive earnings for META. Looking at past data, it\u2019s possible that even if META exceeds estimates, the stock will drop. And if earnings meet or are below expectations META should be strongly red. I\u2019m not buying calls and would recommend being cautious. Puts could be the move but everything is a lotto around earnings. ",

    "selftext": "When I first wrote about ASTS [4 years ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o0czbg/dd_asts_a_binary_bet_with_deep_space_value/), it was the first DD on the stock to appear on this subreddit. I told you to dismantle your grandparents porch to sell the top of lumber and buy the stock. I was kinda right but also terribly wrong as you can see in my [gain post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ewg3t9/conviction_or_mental_illness_you_decide_asts/). Now I am older, wiser, richer, and with a hotter wife and better DD. So settle in and learn something. Or don\u2019t, it\u2019s whatever. When you last ignored me there was one key point in the ASTS Investment Thesis:\n\n1) ASTS Wholesale Model gives them access to billions of customers and thereby revenue.\n\n* All Satellite companies (save for SpaceX\u2019s Starlink) have failed because they cannot effectively monetize their service. Technology isn\u2019t a problem, it\u2019s the go-to-market strategy which fails. ASTS has solved this with its wholesale model working with existing telecoms under the FCCs rules for Supplemental Coverage from Space.\n\n* Iridium was one of the most incredible engineering accomplishments in history, everyone who used it loved it. It was the only way calls could be made in NYC on 9/11, the only way to call out of New Orleans in Hurricane Katrina, it\u2019s the first thing every person at the top of Everest reaches for, the list goes on.\n\n* The problem is that Iridium couldn\u2019t sell the service. It was expensive (for the specialized headset and by the minute in its use), people didn\u2019t know it existed (Iridium were engineers not marketers), a market didn\u2019t exist (maritime and remote villages and niche minute by minute sales does not a market make).\n\n   * ASTS solves this with its super wholesale model where AT&T, Verizon, Rakuten, Vodaphone, and others do all the marketing, all the sales, all the billing, and upsell their existing customer base for a service they want anyway (more on this later).\n\n      * ASTS does not need to find customers. Their agreements with the above give them instant access to 3B paying handsets overnight.\n\n      * ASTS does not need to sell the world a new device. Every cell phone just works.\n\nThat is the entire story that valued ASTS to its core investors since it started trading as a SPAC. While every single ASTS long term investor lost the love of their wives as the stock cratered to 1.98, the story changed. Five additional pillars have been layered on top of the above original thesis which makes me (and you if you are capable of reading) more bullish. They are as follows:\n\n2) Military Applications Non-Communications Use\n\n* The large array and patented technology have more uses than just communications with cell phones.\n\n   * They can be used as an alternative to GPS, for Missile Tracking, for PNT, and more.\n\n   * Any piece of military equipment that can accept a small wireless chip can use ASTS.\n\n   * The future of war is remote drone operations. They need connection. ASTS does that too.\n\n* ASTS was awarded (through a prime contractor) a United States Space Development Agency (SDA) contract worth $43 million\n\n   * This is for 6 satellites for one year and paid out linearly.\n\n   * Fairwinds advertisement for the service shows ASTS communicating with existing Military Satellites.\n\n   * This award will likely be expanded as more satellites come into service.\n\n* Hybrid Acquisition for proliferated Low-earth Orbit (HALO) program\n\n   * ASTS was awarded a starter contract as their own prime.\n\n   * The program can cover launch and parts costs on top of service payments.\n\n   * End game of this is ASTS use for missile tracking in the \u201cGolden Dome\u201d the Trump administration wants to build out.\n\n3) European Monopoly / Satco Joint Venture with Vodaphone\n\n* ASTS and Vodaphone created a joint venture for all of Europe where they will sell the service to other European Telcos. They will also be offering the service to the European Government much like the company is currently doing in the US.\n\n   * Importantly all the data will be sent and received entirely in the EU. All infrastructure will live in the EU. It will be an entirely European Company to be more marketable in Europe.\n\n* All of this has happened as Elon is nuking his rep in Europe with \u201croman\u201d salutes and threating to withhold Ukraine\u2019s access to Starlink. People are realizing that Elon is not dependable, and they need alternatives. ASTS is that alternative.\n\n4) The company has begun to acquire Ligado Spectrum to create their own data service which does not rely on the leasing of spectrum from AT&T and Verizon.\n\n* This Ligado spectrum has been unusable in the past due to interference with GPS and military spectrum in nearby bands.\n\n   * Ligado was using this Satellite Spectrum as Terrestrial with FCC waivers unsuccessfully.\n\n   * ASTS brings value to this spectrum through its beam forming which results in no interference.\n\n* Spectrum can be valued on a per mhz per population basis.\n\n   * At .40 - .80 /MHz-pop \\* 40 MHZ \\* 330M people in the United States we can value this spectrum at \\~8Billion dollars.\n\n      * This is the entire Market Cap of ASTS as it stands today.\n\n      * The company is acquiring the exclusive use of this spectrum for far below this cost. (350M + 4.7M penny warrants + 80M / year + small revenue share)\n\n      * The value of spectrum based on previous auctions likely discounts the future value of spectrum based on the number of connected devices we will be seeing in the future. There is more upside than the $8B figure represents (see point 5Bi).\n\n   * ASTS does its own design and manufacturing and is already designing a new satellite to work with its Ligado spectrum.\n\n   * This deal closing will allow ASTS to sell capacity to its partners or offer their own service ala Starlink.\n\n5) AI requires constant connectivity\n\n* [Facebook is spending $10B to put fiber underwater for bigger pipes for their own data](https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/29/meta-plans-to-build-a-10b-subsea-cable-spanning-the-world-sources-say/?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAB9Zn-QxaAgZypcTXZnX7qnT_XW8Gtm4Lo4e7AnQZD3d-HkWV24RLmg0B_RTon33a68Fc4NrzIVFSP-WXsOWjJOjFeE1wLz0KSRP2ZuVXG6ExThE5kmYcSVrb7JhUouBqIV1sWg4g1T-G7jWRobaSH1MIwaH3ANKhUl_xh4xsg7X). That\u2019s all that you need to know about where the biggest companies believe data is going with the introduction of AI. ASTS solves this and blankets the entire earth with data connectivity (albeit with less speed).\n\n   * However, building this giant globe spanning fiber still does not solve the issue of connectivity in the outer reaches of the planet. This is just for the easily accessible areas meaning ASTS still provides value in data delivery which may be of use to companies like Facebook.\n\n* Autonomous AI Agents need connection and backup connections to operate. Data delivery in all corners of the world matters to make use of AI.\n\n* Think of every time you have paid $20 for internet on a plane. You need it access to data too, even if you think AI doesn\u2019t (it does).\n\n   * Consider the number of connected \u201cthings\u201d you have now. Airtags, smart watches, phones, laptops, cars, trucks, fucking killer drones from Palmer Lucky, farm equipment, doorbells, your wife\u2019s WiFi Dildo that actually makes her cum unlike you, your WiFi buttplug, etc. All of this adds value to the ability to reliably deliver internet to all corners of the planet. That is ASTS\u2019 market.\n\n6) Space is strategic\n\n* When I first wrote about the company I thought Elon and Bezos were just playing with the new billionaires toy of rockets. It turns out they were just one step ahead of the game. Space is strategic and having access to your own internet is incredibly valuable given the need for constant connection with AI. They know this and are leveraging their launch capacity to build out their own private internet.\n\n* ASTS benefits from an increase in launch capacity by having these billionaires fight for ASTS billions of dollars in launch costs. ASTS can essentially play king maker. Every dollar which goes to Blue Origin isn\u2019t going to SpaceX and vice versa. ASTS future launch cadence with its \\~150 launches represents billions in launch costs. They can make the below fight for the lowest cost to get this future business. Note: ASTS already has agreements for 60 launches into the end of 2026. At 20 satellites the company expects to be at cash flow breakeven.\n\n* Don't bet against the below. The Space Trade will come.\n\n   * Elon Musk \u2013 Starlink SpaceX\n\n   * Jeff Bezos \u2013 Blue Origin New Glenn Kupier\n\n   * Eric Schmidt \u2013 Relativity\n\n   * Peter Beck \u2013 Rocket Lab\n\n   * Abel Avellan - ASTS\n\n  \nBefore one of you morons say \u201cwaaaaaa but what about starlink?\u201d shut the fuck up and get out of my DD. Thanks. Starlink proper does not speak to cell phones which is why they require end users to have a dish or a mini dish to use their service. Their direct to cell solution with T-Mobile is not purpose built and has failed to deliver simple text messages. Take some time to read reviews of their service. It is complete shit and has no hopes of delivering broadband speed like ASTS without a complete redesign (which is probably difficult given that their lead engineer for D2C just left the company. Not a great look innit?). Alright with that out of the way we can continue. The rest of this writeup I completed for school and is a technical writeup of the company. Enjoy or whatever. There is very little information about the business valuation because I am not smart like that (or in any other way but neither are you). **If you want to know more**, read u/thekookreport \u2018s DD [document](https://www.kookreport.com/post/ast-spacemobile-asts-the-mobile-satellite-cellular-network-monopoly-please-find-my-final-comp). ***It is incredible and if you take the time to read it you might have the conviction required to acquire generational wealth. Good luck!*** Anyways here ya go bud:\n\n**Company and Industry Background**\n\nAST SpaceMobile (ASTS) is pioneering direct-to-device satellite connectivity, enabling standard, unmodified smartphones to connect directly to satellites for broadband cellular service. This groundbreaking technology positions ASTS uniquely to deliver global mobile broadband coverage, especially in areas lacking traditional terrestrial infrastructure. Through large, powerful phased-array antennas deployed on satellites in low Earth orbit, ASTS creates \"cell towers in space\" which provide seamless connectivity without the need for specialized satellite phones or additional equipment like satellite dishes.\n\nGlobally, approximately 2.6 billion people lack internet access (World Economic Forum), primarily due to economic barriers in deploying terrestrial networks in remote or sparsely populated regions. ASTS addresses this significant digital divide by allowing these individuals to access broadband services using any existing smartphone.\n\n*According to Groupe Speciale Mobile Association (\u201cGSMA\u201d), as of December 31, 2024, approximately 5.8 billion mobile subscribers are constantly moving in and out of coverage, approximately 3.4 billion people have no cellular broadband coverage and approximately 350.0 million people have no connectivity or mobile cellular coverage*.\n\nThere are approximately 6.8 Billion smartphones in the world all of which would be compatible with ASTS service on Day 1 without any modifications required as their service purely mimics existing GSMA service. As global connectivity becomes increasingly essential, particularly with the rapid expansion and integration of artificial intelligence, the value of ASTS grows exponentially.\n\nASTS strategically targets underserved regions in both developed and developing markets, focusing on areas where conventional terrestrial infrastructure is economically impractical or geographically challenging. The company's approach aligns with the FCC's Supplemental Coverage from Space (SCS) framework (FCC-23-22A1), which outlines the means of providing cell phone coverage from space and necessitates spectrum leasing agreements with established Mobile Network Operators (MNOs). Recognizing this requirement, ASTS has secured strategic investments from industry leaders such as Google, AT&T, Verizon, American Tower, and Vodafone. These investments validate ASTS's technological and business approach, simultaneously offering traditional MNOs a beneficial partnership. Operators like AT&T and Verizon benefit by monetizing their spectrum in otherwise unused regions. This also benefits MNOs and American Tower by effectively hedging their terrestrial tower businesses against the propagation of space-based service and maximizing existing assets and valuable spectrum.\n\nUnlike conventional satellite phone providers or systems such as Starlink and Project Kuiper, which compensate for smaller satellite footprints by relying heavily on extensive ground infrastructure, ASTS's design is distinct. It employs significantly larger satellite antenna arrays, enabling direct communication with regular mobile phones without modifications. The large antennas generate a robust, \"loud\" signal from space, capable of directly reaching unmodified consumer devices\u2014contrasting sharply with traditional satellite phones, which rely on devices actively searching for faint satellite signals. Additionally, ASTS's larger arrays dramatically reduce the total number of satellites needed for global coverage. For instance, while Project Kuiper plans to deploy 3,236 satellites and Starlink already operates over 8,000 satellites, ASTS aims to achieve global coverage with approximately 168 satellites. This not only optimizes efficiency but also addresses growing concerns about orbital congestion and space debris.\n\nThe wholesale go-to-market strategy adopted by ASTS leverages existing customer bases from mobile network operators, providing a significant competitive advantage. Unlike previous satellite endeavors, such as Iridium\u2014which faced challenges not with technology but with market adoption due to high costs and complex marketing\u2014ASTS offers a straightforward, accessible solution that integrates seamlessly with existing mobile ecosystems. The model ensures rapid adoption and scalability, delivering reliable broadband service globally without the barriers encountered by traditional satellite communication providers.\n\nTo further enhance customer accessibility and peace of mind, ASTS offers flexible pricing options such as day passes and affordable monthly fees, ensuring users remain consistently connected wherever they travel. This model caters to the growing expectation of constant connectivity, as increasingly more devices\u2014including cars, smartwatches, location trackers, and other IoT gadgets\u2014rely on continuous internet access. Consumers regularly demonstrate willingness to pay for reliable connectivity, just think of every time you have paid or considered paying $24.99 for in-flight Wi-Fi.\n\n*In fact, early findings show nearly two-thirds of subscribers are willing to pay extra \\[for satellite connectivity\\], with about half open to \\~$5/month for off-grid connectivity*\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/686tx10740we1.png?width=805&format=png&auto=webp&s=76569830d31ca62109df32d826f844acd3d24de5\n\n**Source(s) of innovation**\n\nWhen a cell phone initiates a call or sends data, the signal travels through an uplink from the device to the nearest cell tower. At the tower\u2019s base station, this signal is processed and forwarded through a high-capacity connection known as backhaul, typically via fiber-optic cables or microwave links, toward the network core. The network core functions like the network's brain, determining the signal\u2019s destination and routing it accordingly. From the network core, the call or data is directed out through the appropriate aggregation points and backhaul connections toward the recipient\u2019s nearest tower. At this final cell tower, the signal is sent via a downlink directly to the receiving user\u2019s phone, completing the communication.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p4kc3cr740we1.png?width=493&format=png&auto=webp&s=fe5eb433f21ef132dd8abc60d8216506e65c150b\n\nIn contrast, ASTS' approach replaces traditional cell towers and terrestrial backhaul infrastructure with satellites positioned in low Earth orbit. When a phone communicates with AST's BlueBird satellite, the uplink signal travels directly from the user's phone to the satellite itself, acting as a \"tower in space.\" The satellite processes and beams the signal back down to strategically located ground gateways that connect to the terrestrial network core, bypassing the extensive network of ground towers and traditional backhaul. The core network then routes the call or data to the recipient, either via terrestrial towers or via another satellite beam. This approach effectively removes geographic barriers, delivering cellular connectivity even in remote or underserved areas where traditional terrestrial infrastructure is unavailable or economically impractical.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xwbphlj840we1.png?width=466&format=png&auto=webp&s=d87b8e32dabc983d52690b9cc247a75357722035\n\nStarlink has recently gained significant attention with its high-profile Super Bowl advertisement showcasing their satellite texting offering with T-Mobile, bringing public awareness to direct-to-device (D2D) connectivity (Mobile World Live). However, despite this increased visibility, Starlink faces inherent technological limitations in its beam-forming capabilities. The satellite's antennas generate broad, flashlight-like beams that cover large geographical areas but lack precision. This approach leads to increased interference with neighboring networks and limits Starlink's ability to efficiently reuse spectrum, ultimately restricting network capacity and data throughput for individual users.\n\nStarlink's beam design contrasts sharply with more advanced D2D satellite systems that utilize precise, narrowly-focused beams to minimize interference and maximize spectrum efficiency. Due to Starlink's broader beam coverage, each satellite can serve fewer distinct user groups simultaneously, which reduces overall service quality and speed per user. As a result, while Starlink's high-profile marketing has drawn consumer attention to satellite-based mobile connectivity, its practical applications remain constrained, particularly in densely populated or interference-sensitive areas where efficient beam management and high throughput are critical.\n\nComparatively, ASTS employs significantly narrower, laser-focused beams enabled by their large phased-array antennas, as detailed in FCC filings (FCC 20200413-00034). ASTS satellites can generate beams as narrow as less than one degree, precisely targeting coverage areas and significantly reducing interference. In contrast, Starlink\u2019s FCC filings (FCC 1091870146061) indicate beam widths that can span tens or hundreds of kilometers, with antenna gains around 38 dBi, resulting in broader coverage but increased interference and reduced spectral efficiency. ASTS's advanced beam-forming capabilities allow for precise, efficient frequency reuse and higher overall throughput per user, providing a notable advantage over Starlink in both performance and spectrum management.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xgl7egn940we1.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=b23b49ff581a6570c470fb5666a6006417d6fd50\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cfcf2mka40we1.png?width=541&format=png&auto=webp&s=cedc4388c33eef2189cebc720f5327cdf5091649\n\n\n\nThe top image taken from FCC Filings represents the antenna pattern for ASTS' system, akin to a laser pointer, with a very sharp, narrow central beam and significantly lower sidelobes. This tight focus ensures the energy is highly concentrated, minimizing interference with other areas and maximizing the signal strength in the intended coverage zone. Conversely, the bottom image illustrates Starlink's broader beam pattern, similar to a flashlight, with a wide central lobe and substantial sidelobes. The broader distribution of energy leads to greater interference and less precise coverage, reducing overall network efficiency and limiting the achievable throughput per user.\n\nASTS innovation is best shown in their extensive patent portfolio some of which protect this signal creation. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fzqf4ijb40we1.png?width=919&format=png&auto=webp&s=2112a61c00314bf51eb1de3a0837501f7067bc96\n\nASTS utilizes significantly larger satellites featuring advanced phased-array antennas that unfold in orbit, allowing them to generate stronger and more precise signals directly to standard mobile phones. The satellite itself employs a straightforward \"bent pipe\" design, which simply receives signals from phones and redirects them toward ground gateways without complex onboard processing. The sophisticated management of signals is handled by ASTS's proprietary software on the ground, ensuring seamless integration with existing mobile carrier networks and compatibility with current and future mobile technologies (including 6G). We can examine some key patents\u00a0 from the company to gain a better understanding of their technology advantage:\n\n**Mechanical Deployable Structure for LEO:** This patent covers AST\u2019s deployment mechanism for its large flat satellites\u200b. The satellite\u2019s antenna array is made of many square/rectangular panels (with solar on one side and antennas on the other) hinged together with spring-loaded connectors. These stored-energy hinges (often called spring tapes) automatically unfold the panels into a contiguous flat array once the satellite is in space, without needing motors or power to do the deployment. In essence, the satellite launches compactly folded up, and when it reaches orbit, it pops open on its own like a spring-loaded blanket. This is a core enabler for ASTS business: it allows them to fit a very large antenna into a small launch volume and reliably deploy it in orbit\u200b. The self-deploying design reduces complexity and points of failure (since fewer motors or controls are needed), lowering launch and manufacturing costs. Successfully deploying a massive antenna is critical for AST\u2019s service capability.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7iewd2jc40we1.png?width=823&format=png&auto=webp&s=6561e0f1bf475df91dddb0b405ce48f860b72ad4\n\n**Integrated Antenna Module with Thermal Management:** This patent describes the flat antenna module that integrates solar cells and radio antennas into one structure and includes built-in cooling features\u200b. In simple terms, each panel on ASTS satellite serves as both a power source (via solar cells) and a communication antenna, while also dissipating its own heat. This means the satellite can be made up of many such panels tiled into the huge antenna array above without overheating. This innovation allows ASTS to deploy very large, power-efficient antennas in orbit, enabling stronger signals and broad coverage for mobile users without the weight or complexity of separate cooling systems.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/igtsmgfd40we1.png?width=392&format=png&auto=webp&s=46f9469918898ad963dcaab50aa229f2ce8ffdc1\n\n**Dynamic Time Division Duplex (DTDD) for Satellite Networks:** This patent introduces a smart timing controller that manages uplink and downlink signals so they don\u2019t collide when using time-division duplex (TDD) over satellite\u200b. In layman\u2019s terms, because satellites are far away, signals take longer to travel \u2013 this system dynamically adjusts when a phone should send vs. receive so that echoes of a transmission don\u2019t interfere with new data. For ASTS, this technology is crucial: it lets standard mobile phones communicate seamlessly with satellites by fine-tuning timing, which improves network reliability and throughput. Without this patent the time between uplink and downlink would result in loss of signal as normal cell signals are not used to the latency experienced in space travel.\n\n**Geolocation of Devices Using Spaceborne Phased Arrays:** This patent outlines a method for pinpointing a phone\u2019s location from space using the satellite\u2019s phased-array antenna\u200b. The satellite first uses its multiple beams to get a rough location (which cell or area the device is in), then refines the device\u2019s position by analyzing Doppler shifts and signal travel time. The satellite can not only talk to your phone but also figure out where you are by how your signal frequency changes (due to motion) and delays, similar to how GPS works but using the communication signal itself.\n\n**Direct GSM Communication via Satellite:** This patent covers a solution that allows standard GSM mobile phones (2G phones) to connect directly to a satellite\u200b. The system involves a satellite with a coverage area divided into cells and a ground infrastructure that includes a feeder link and tracking antenna to manage the connection. A primary processing device communicates with the active users\u2019 phones, and a secondary processor adjusts timing delays for all the beams/cells. This tricks the GSM phones into thinking the satellite is just another cell tower by handling the long signal delay.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f8er6l9e40we1.png?width=777&format=png&auto=webp&s=abca83f58c82d29a8223d56ad0a26db503aecf2e\n\n**Network Access Management for Satellite RAN:** This patent describes a method to efficiently handle when a user device first tries to connect to a satellite-based radio network\u200b. The idea is to use a single wide beam from the satellite to watch for any phone requesting access across a large area of many cells. Once a phone\u2019s request is detected in a particular cell, the system then lights up that cell with a focused beam (and can broadcast necessary signals to other inactive cells as needed). Essentially, the satellite first yells \u201canyone out there?\u201d over a broad area, and when a phone waves back, the satellite switches to a more targeted conversation with that phone\u2019s sector. This on-demand beam switching is business-critical for ASTS: it conserves power and spectrum by not constantly servicing empty regions, allowing one satellite to cover many cells efficiently. It means the network can support more users over a wide area with fewer satellites, lowering operational costs and improving user experience by quickly granting access when someone pops up in a normally quiet zone.\n\n**Satellite MIMO Communication System:** This patent describes a technique for using multiple antennas on both the satellite (or satellites) and the user side to create a MIMO (multiple-input multiple-output) link for data\u200b. In simple terms, the base station on the ground can send out multiple distinct radio streams through different satellite beams or even different satellites to a device that has several antennas. By doing so, the end user (if capable, like modern phones with multiple antennas) can receive parallel data streams, boosting throughput.\n\n**Seamless Beam Handover Between Satellites:** This patent deals with handing off a user\u2019s connection from one low-Earth-orbit satellite to the next to avoid dropped calls or data sessions\u200b. It outlines a system where an area on Earth (cell) that is covered by a setting satellite (one moving out of view) is also in view of a rising satellite. The network uses overlapping beams: one satellite\u2019s beam and then the other\u2019s beam cover the same cell during handover. A processing device orchestrates two communication links and switches the user\u2019s session from the first satellite to the second as the first goes over the horizon.\n\n**Types/Patterns of Innovation**\n\n**Initial Testing**\n\nAST began its journey in 2019 with modest yet creative experiment. Their first satellite, BlueWalker 1 (BW1), placed the components of an everyday cell phone into space as a nanosatellite developed in collaboration with NanoAvionics. Instead of the conventional and costly approach\u2014launching a satellite to communicate with ground-based phones, AST reversed this arrangement. They connected a cell phone in orbit with a specialized ground-based satellite (BlueWalker 2). This unusual yet insightful solution significantly reduced the initial costs of launch deployment, enabling rapid and cost-effective R&D. This approach was innovative both economically and operationally, demonstrating practical, real-world viability of their core concept.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hkwipmdf40we1.png?width=586&format=png&auto=webp&s=e5c9f53577d14b69f873d75c4a3e98bfd039c361\n\n**Funding and Expansion**\n\nEarly on, the company attracted strategic backing from the telecom industry. In 2020, a Series\u00a0B round of $110\u00a0million was led by Vodafone and Japan\u2019s Rakuten, with participation from Samsung, and American Tower signaling broad industry confidence in AST\u2019s direct-to-phone satellite technology. Importantly, during this time these investors did their own due diligence on the business and verified the work up to this point and the business case. Rather than a traditional IPO, ASTS utilized a SPAC merger to go public: in April 2021 it merged with New Providence Acquisition Corp., raising a total of $462\u00a0million in gross proceeds including $230\u00a0million from a PIPE investment by Vodafone, Rakuten, and American Tower.\n\n**BlueWalker 3 Satellite**\n\nWith SPAC funding secured, ASTS increased their R&D spend to launch a fully functional satellite, BlueWalker 3 (BW3), featuring the largest phased-array antenna ever deployed in space (save for the international space station). The satellite was approximately 700 sq ft, roughly the size of a one-bedroom apartment. BW3 employed Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA), enabling in-orbit software upgrades and flexible testing to allow changes not captured with BW1 to be complete after launch. Successful demonstrations of BW3's capability included groundbreaking tests such as the first-ever 5G video call from space to an everyday smartphone in Hawaii, validating their ability to deliver advanced broadband connectivity directly from orbit.\n\n**BlueBird Block 1**\n\nIn September 2024, AST took critical steps toward commercialization with the launch of their first commercial satellites BlueBirds 1 through 5 (Space.com). These satellites further tested vital functionalities, including seamless handoffs between satellites, a key requirement for global continuous connectivity. These launches were strategically significant, marking the transition from proof-of-concept to scalable commercial operations. Demonstration video calls were conducted and announced through MNO partners Vodafone, AT&T, and Verizon for testing AST\u2019s technology in real-world networks. These tests were the result of the FCC granting a Special Temporary Authority (STA) to the company. This was particularly significant given its alignment with the broader regulatory landscape under the new FCC commissioner Brendan Carr (Trump Appointed) which shows the regulatory and market acceptance of AST's innovative business model. Further, this removed the Elon Musk sized elephant in the room wherein Starlink was thought to be the only satellite gaining the approval under the new administration.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/eug6ardg40we1.png?width=655&format=png&auto=webp&s=0ae60b0b69faf8b96915df1273f762cef6232861\n\n**Next-Generation ASICs**\n\nAST is also innovating on hardware performance through development of next-generation Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs). Replacing initial FPGA implementations, these ASIC chips promise a 100x increase in data throughput (as in total data deliverable). This dramatic efficiency improvement increases future satellite capabilities and economic performance, making their network even more attractive for commercial deployment.\n\n**Next-Generation Satellites**\n\nAST\u2019s innovation continues with BlueBird 2 (BB2), a significantly scaled-up satellite design of 2,400 sq ft. Incorporating next-gen ASIC technology, these satellites represent a major leap forward in performance and capability, scheduled to be launched through agreements with Blue Origin, ISRO, and SpaceX. Through increased size and performance from the ASIC, ASTS intends to increase the 30mbps download speed represented by Block 1 to 120 mbps in future iterations of their technology. By the end of 2026, AST aims to have a constellation of approximately 60 satellites in orbit, bolstered by substantial financial backing with over $1 billion in available capital.\n\n**Strategic Spectrum Acquisition**\n\nSee above Ligado. At character limit.\n\n**Military and Government Partnerships**\n\nRecognizing strategic opportunities, AST has advanced their military use cases, positioning its technology as a solution for the U.S. Department of Defense and Space Development Agency (SDA). With their satellite constellation able to integrate seamlessly with existing military satellite communication (MILSATCOM) infrastructure AST becomes highly relevant for sensitive government applications such as missile tracking, asset monitoring, and secure communications. A recent $43 million SDA contract further highlights AST\u2019s alignment with national security interests and confirms their technology\u2019s strategic importance.\n\n*As part of the U.S. Space Force, SDA will accelerate delivery of needed space-based capabilities to the joint warfighter to support terrestrial missions through development, fielding, and operation of the Proliferated Warfighter Space Architecture.*\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wo72i4ih40we1.png?width=670&format=png&auto=webp&s=dfcb2d233638254aaa7e9b114c9ffb64251c1bb0\n\n**Definition of \u201cValue-added\u201d for the Firm\u2019s Products/Services**\n\n**Resilience in Disaster Response**\n\nOne of the most compelling advantages of a space-based cellular network is its resilience during disasters. When hurricanes, wildfires, earthquakes, or other natural disasters strike, terrestrial infrastructure often fails. Cell towers can be knocked out by storms or burned in wildfires, leaving first responders and affected communities without communication exactly when it\u2019s most needed. ASTS satellite technology adds a crucial layer of redundancy: even if ground towers are down, the network in the sky and a single base station anywhere in the country remains operational. This capability can be life-saving in emergency scenarios.\n\nASTS has been working closely with AT&T to integrate its system with FirstNet, the dedicated U.S. public safety network for first responders. FirstNet, built by AT&T, provides priority cellular service to police, firefighters, EMTs and other emergency personnel. By extending FirstNet into space, ASTS ensures that first responders stay connected in real time, anywhere. The value added by ASTS in disaster response is clear: persistent coverage when conventional networks fail.\n\n**Cost Efficiency Compared to Subsea Cables**\n\nBuilding out global internet connectivity has traditionally meant expensive infrastructure projects, such as undersea fiber-optic cables to connect continents. These projects involve enormous capital expenditures and long deployment timelines. ASTS' approach \u2013 launching a constellation of low Earth orbit satellites \u2013 presents a potentially more flexible and cost-efficient path to worldwide broadband coverage. A rough cost comparison highlights this difference in strategy and scalability. ASTS plans to deploy a complete constellation of 168 satellites to achieve global coverage. Each satellite in AST\u2019s \u201cBlueBird\u201d series is estimated to cost on the order of $20 million to build and launch.\n\n*Brian Graft, Analyst, Deutsche Bank: Anything on the cost per satellite? Has that changed at all? Are you still in that $19,000,000 to $21,000,000 range? Abel Avellan: No. Yes, we\u2019re not changing the guidance on cost per satellite*\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ekodb1pi40we1.png?width=824&format=png&auto=webp&s=03caa476262231e043b928ceacdee51a854d05d0\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that satellite broadband isn\u2019t a wholesale replacement for fiber in terms of raw capacity \u2013 major cables can carry tremendous data volume at very low latency along their fixed routes, which is vital for the core internet backbone. However, from a business strategy perspective, ASTS' satellites offer a more economical way to extend the \u201clast mile\u201d of connectivity to users who would otherwise require huge investment to reach.\n\n**Enabling Always-On Connectivity for Emerging Technologies**\n\nBeyond simply connecting people, ASTS' continuous global coverage unlocks critical opportunities for emerging technologies that depend on uninterrupted internet access. For AI agents and cloud services, constant connectivity is essential. Autonomous robotics, including self-driving cars, drones, and agricultural robots, similarly benefit from AST\u2019s satellite service, ensuring seamless operation even in remote areas beyond traditional cellular coverage.\n\n**Strategic Independence and the European D2D Initiative**\n\nSee Above SatCo JV with Vodaphone. Need to cut word count.\n\n**Wholesale Model**\n\nNomadBets twitter shows the breakdown of subscriber potential with ASTS. This is where revenue will blow out all expectations. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6lr5z0xo40we1.png?width=1586&format=png&auto=webp&s=6c48c2596ef8e077b391cf1ac8121122604a86d8\n\nASTS competencies are built around its ability to design, manufacture, and deploy large and powerful satellites optimized for direct-to-device (D2D) connectivity. All of which are critical for maximizing signal strength, bandwidth, and data throughput directly to everyday smartphones. AST's expertise in large arrays is particularly advantageous, as bigger (and thereby heavier) arrays translate directly into stronger signals, increased power generation, and significantly improved data speeds to user devices. ASTS requires just 168 large satellites for global coverage, compared to 3,236 for Amazon's Kuiper and over 8,158 for SpaceX's Starlink, this greatly reduces CAPEX, collision risk, launch risk, and replacement costs for AST. With all this in mind, AST benefits greatly from falling launch costs enabled by leading space-launch providers such as Blue Origin and SpaceX. This is best displayed as a year-over-year pricing trend of launch vehicles on a per-kilogram basis:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4czj2u8q40we1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=6b1dc9937bf0e7f1da432fb69857d50618053670\n\nAs launch providers increasingly offer higher-capacity rockets at reduced costs, ASTS uniquely benefits from its strategy of deploying fewer, heavier satellites with large, high-performance antennas rather than numerous smaller satellites. The first successful flight of Blue Origin\u2019s New Glenn rocket notably demonstrated its capability to carry up to eight of AST\u2019s Block 2 satellites simultaneously, providing a clear cost advantage. Likewise, SpaceX\u2019s Falcon 9, recognized globally for its reliability and affordability, can accommodate four Block 2 satellites per launch. Additionally, the progress on SpaceX\u2019s Starship program offers further promise, potentially unlocking even greater launch capacities at lower costs.\n\nAST's operational competencies are further strengthened by its vertical integration.\n\n*Approximately 95% vertically integrated for manufacturing of satellite components and subsystems, for which we own or license the IP and control the manufacturing process*.\n\nBy controlling its own production processes and intellectual property, AST not only reduces dependency on external suppliers\u2014mitigating geopolitical and supply-chain risks\u2014but also achieves superior cost efficiencies and quality control. This vertical integration is crucial at a time when the United States is prioritizing domestic capability in strategic industries like space technology, positioning AST favorably to benefit from increasing governmental support and protective policies.\n\nThe company's production strategy is robust and ambitious, with AST targeting a monthly production rate of six satellites at its Texas factory. This consistent cadence enables rapid scaling and timely replacement of satellites, ensuring continuous, reliable service for customers. Given rising geopolitical tensions, particularly concerning competition with China in space exploration and technology, AST's fully integrated, U.S.-based manufacturing operation places it strategically to capitalize on potential government partnerships or contracts aimed at strengthening domestic space capabilities.\n\n**Organizational Structure/Culture/Leadership**\n\nThis section was about the leadership team of the company. It is just regurgitated from their own website and is not really valuable. Here is all you need to know: the CEO Abel Avellan is a certified bad ass. He has had a successful exit from his first company EMC and used that cash to fund this company. He takes no salary, he doesn\u2019t have a crazy stock based compensation that he extracts with, he is just a good dude who is aligned with the company and its investors. He doesn\u2019t spend his day on twitter trying to impregnate Tiffany Fong. He has not lied about his ability to play Diablo or PoE2. We like Abel. You should too.\n\nPositions Disclosure:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ra1e5a8v40we1.png?width=1435&format=png&auto=webp&s=9f600912d596eb2619a4a666c7b4b8b2ecfdf22f\n\n",

    "selftext": "***TLDR;*** *Analysts have emphasized the impacts of tariffs on commodities, autos, and tangible goods. However, the escalation of this tariff trade war will most significantly impact digital goods.*\n\n***The Play TLDR***; *Short tech (QQQ puts, SPY puts, SOXL puts)*  \n\n\nOn April 2nd, we will (allegedly) learn what Donald Trump's plan will be for \"rolling back unfair trade practices that have been ripping off America\". Currently, analysts are primarily focused on illustrating the impacts of these tariffs on commodities and industrials. Understandably, since these asset classes are most commonly included in U.S. top export metrics:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/azbupva7p4se1.png?width=477&format=png&auto=webp&s=38847b3d9ae4e0c455639abd44c036e1ec923be9\n\n  \n***THE POINT:***\n\n  \nIn 1998, the World Trade Organization (WTO) temporarily banned tariffs on a class of assets called \"electronic transmissions\" (digital goods). This decision was made due to the rapid and unparalleled emergence of a new medium of information exchange called **the \"internet\".**\n\n  \nThis ban prevented members from charging tariffs on goods provided electronically over the web. This temporary ban has been reviewed every two years by member countries, with the outcome being that it is mutually beneficial to keep the moratorium in place.  \nThis moratorium has played a ***critical*** role in U.S. tech's profitability:\n\n\n\n[Current framework of free digital trade](https://preview.redd.it/sfyu2o6gp4se1.jpg?width=768&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d4025959602f933ad83942912a6ffadfda84f97b)\n\nIn the example above, a company providing digital goods/services can trade freely with other countries. Digital transactions are not treated like physical goods transported internationally, where the goods must be declared at customs and taxes paid on their value.\n\n  \nThis framework has been deemed to be in the best interest of the world for **decades**, and all political parties have managed to put aside their differences to ensure this framework's survival for the greater good. However, ***Trump's current economic offensive has put this framework at risk when/if other countries decide to \"strike back\":***  \n\n\n[Framework for digital trade under tariffs](https://preview.redd.it/8ty1db2sp4se1.jpg?width=768&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c14880088e780e48b6796d64f5295d40e572fd0c)\n\n***THE PROBLEM:***\n\nNearly [$270B or 70% of U.S. \"services\" exports](https://project-disco.org/21st-century-trade/new-government-data-shows-digital-services-exports-continue-to-drive-u-s-trade/) come from digital goods. Referring to the first picture of this post, this is roughly $62B more than the current top U.S. tangible goods export (Cars/Car parts (implied)). \n\nThe problem, then, is derived from the following:\n\n[\\>50&#37; of the revenue of the S&P 500 IT sectors comes from foreign countries](https://preview.redd.it/7oxbsiqis4se1.png?width=520&format=png&auto=webp&s=7c978c1b69a7f9b22ee05f14060974c87508e801)\n\nNVDA, GOOG, META, AAPL, and other tech stocks would incur significant losses from the termination of the 1998 e-commerce moratorium.\n\n***The Endgame:*** \n\nThe tariffs proposed by the Trump administration will **invalidate** the 1998 WTO moratorium agreement **->** Foreign governments looking to push back against the U.S. tariffs will target U.S. tech and digital goods/services **->** U.S. tech margins will contract, as they are forced to account for taxes/tariffs on services provided internationally (i.e. Netflix pays tariffs on shows streamed by consumers in Europe) **->** U.S. economy will enter a recession due to the concentration of the top 10% of wealth (locked in the stock market) compromising \\~50% of all U.S. spending\n\n\n\n***Positions:***\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ujzs3n0hx4se1.jpg?width=839&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ffad43ac5e67af7df8b64e6347467ecc11118c38\n\nSources:\n\nDigital Services GDP: [https://project-disco.org/21st-century-trade/new-government-data-shows-digital-services-exports-continue-to-drive-u-s-trade/](https://project-disco.org/21st-century-trade/new-government-data-shows-digital-services-exports-continue-to-drive-u-s-trade/)\n\nOEC Tangible Goods Data: [https://oec.world/en/profile/country/usa](https://oec.world/en/profile/country/usa)\n\nWTO Moratorium: [https://web.wtocenter.org.tw/file/PageFile/386868/WTGCW889.pdf](https://web.wtocenter.org.tw/file/PageFile/386868/WTGCW889.pdf)",

Total GLP1 Total prescriptions in the US is estimated to be around 7.1MM adults, 2MM of which are for obesity. This represents 2% of obese US adults and even less internationally, and with LLY capturing \\~57% of share, this signals massive opportunities for growth. According to recent surveys, 1 in 8 consumers have used GLP1 products, while 26% of US consumers expect to use GLP1 in 2025. Massive demand for GLP1 is apparent, and the main bottleneck for growth is LLY\u2019s ability to meet demand. \u00a0  \nAs a result, major investor focus is on LLY GLP1 manufacturing capabilities, which LLY has been heavily investing in.\u00a0\n\nLLY Growth Challenges\u00a0\n\n1. Supply Constraints \u2013 supply cannot keep up with demand as there is not enough manufacturing capacity\u00a0\n2. High Prices \u2013 FDA approved GLP1 products are expensive, and most healthcare plans refuse to cover for obesity, customers unwilling to pay out of pocket\u00a0\n3. Cheaper Alternatives \u2013 supply constraints and high prices cause customers to seek compounded drugs as an alternative\u00a0\n4. Aversion to injection \u2013 current injectable format less attractive than oral drugs, dampening demand\u00a0\n\nCompetitive Landscape: LLY, NVO, and the Compounders\u00a0\n\nEli Lilly and Novo Nordisk (NVO, the producer of Ozempic) are direct competitors in what is currently a two-player obesity drug market. However, due to the exceptionally high demand for GLP1 products, the combined supply from both companies has been insufficient in meeting demand, causing the FDA to declare both Tirzepatide and Semaglutide to be in shortage in 2022. This allowed for the compounding of GLP1 drugs under Section 503A and 503B of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act). Compounders consisting of both licensed physicians and outsourcing facilities could legally produce non-FDA approved versions of GLP1 drugs for both medical and commercial purposes, selling to customers at significantly cheaper prices compared to the patented, FDA-approved drugs of LLY and NVO. For example, Zepbound (LLY\u2019s brand for obesity) costs $1000/month in 2024 while a compounded version could sell for as low as \\~$45/month on HIMS. However, in October of 2024, the FDA removed Tirzepatide and Semaglutide from the shortage list after over two years, leading to the Outsourcing Facilities Association filing a suit against the FDA, and the case in currently pending.\u00a0\n\n# LLY \u2013 A Combination of Short-Term Catalysts\u00a0\u00a0\n\nMajor Catalysts Overview\u00a0\n\nHere is an overview of the most important catalysts in the upcoming 1-2 months:\u00a0\n\n1. OFA v. FDA preliminary injunction and case results (expected March-April, [here](https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/69232675/outsourcing-facilities-association-v-united-states-food-and-drug/?filed_after=&filed_before=&entry_gte=&entry_lte=&order_by=desc))\u00a0\n2. Multiple Orforglipron (Orfor) Ph3 trial data (first expected in April, case [here](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05971940))\u00a0\n3. Final US Government Budget Decision (deadline end of April, article [here](https://www.usnews.com/news/national-news/articles/2025-02-26/the-house-passed-a-budget-blueprint-what-happens-now))\u00a0\n4. Pharmaceutical tariffs (25% and/or reciprocal, article [here](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/lilly-plans-invest-27-billion-new-us-plants-trump-threatens-pharmaceutical-2025-02-26/))\u00a0\n\nWhile we highlight four potential catalysts, 3 and 4 are macro-level catalysts. We will focus primarily on Catalysts 1 and 2 (OFA v. FDA and Orfor Ph3 trial data), with our significant confidence (ahead of market consensus) in both catalysts being positive for LLY as the core of our long thesis. Both catalysts de-risk and pull strong growth levers for LLY.\u00a0\n\nAdditional Levers for Growth\u00a0\n\nBeyond the Catalysts 1 and 2, we also briefly note additional tailwinds for LLY, though these are not the focus of our thesis:\u00a0\n\n1. Growing supply capacity and continued investment in infrastructure and manufacturing (news release [here](https://investor.lilly.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lilly-plans-more-double-us-manufacturing-investment-2020))\u00a0\n2. Pricing power with recent Zepbound and Mounjaro price cuts (news release [here](https://investor.lilly.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lilly-launches-additional-zepbound-vial-doses-and-offers-new))\u00a0\n3. Increasing coverage for GLP1 by healthcare insurance (slowly, article [here](https://www.healthcaredive.com/news/glp-1-drug-coverage-for-obesity-increasing/733596/))\u00a0\n\n# Catalyst 1: OFA v. FDA\u00a0\n\nThe FDA took Tirzepatide off the drug shortage list, in October 2024 and February 2025, respectively. The Outsourcing Facilities Association (OFA) subsequently filed a lawsuit against the FDA. The core of plaintiff's \\\\case argues that FDA\u2019s removal should be considered notice-and-comment \u201crulemaking\u201d under the APA, while the FDA argues that their actions fall under \u201cinformal adjudication\u201d and does not require notice-and-comment. Judge Pittman has stated that he intends to rule this case as a \u201cmatter of law\u201d; the case will be decided depending on whether he considers FDA\u2019s removal of Tirzepatide from the shortage list as adjudication or rulemaking according to legal precedent and relevant cases brought forward by both sides. All relevant court documents that can be found [here](https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/69232675/outsourcing-facilities-association-v-united-states-food-and-drug/?filed_after=&filed_before=&entry_gte=&entry_lte=&order_by=desc). A very helpful podcast with biopharma lawyer Julia Cantu summarizing the situation can be found [here](https://www.martilawgroup.com/post/update-on-tirzepatide-compounding-the-fda-lawsuit-and-the-february-18th-deadline).\u00a0\n\nGLP1 Compound Market Size\u00a0\n\nTo motivate why the OFA v. FDA case is significant for LLY, we project the potential revenue gain by estimating the current GLP1 compounding market.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nOne outsourcing facility, FarmaKeio (FK), has been selling roughly \\~1.75-2 MM worth of Tirzepatide every month at \\~$45/month. Hims and Hers (HIMS) reported 222 MM worth of revenue from compounding GLP1, also with prices around $45/month. With the total market for GLP1 estimated to be around 54 B in sales for 2024 and LLY and NVO representing \\~42 B, the compounding market could represent \\~12 B, or around 22% of the total GLP1 market. At the high end, up to 30% or \\~16 B of GLP1 sales could be from compounders (according to [Beckers Hospital Review](https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/glp-1s/30-of-glp-1-medications-acquired-via-compounding-pharmacies.html)).\u00a0\u00a0\n\nGiven that compound Tirzepatide is \\~10-20x cheaper than brand Tirzepatide and the logical assumption that demand is relatively inelastic, we claim absolute GLP1 sales would not be significantly lower without compounding. Taking the baseline of no change in absolute sales and assuming LLY takes 60% share (based on current LLY/NVO market share), an end to compounding is a one-time \\~20-30% boost to revenue, assuming LLY can meet demand.\u00a0\n\nMy Perspective on OFA v. FDA\u00a0\n\nThe result of this case lies purely in Judge Pittman\u2019s interpretation of the FDA\u2019s actions under the APA vis-\u00e0-vi legal precedence, particularly the following cases presented in court submissions (which I have selected for relevance):\u00a0\n\n* Safari Club Int\u2019l v. Zinke, 878 F.3d 316, 333 (D.C. Cir. 2017)\u00a0\n* United States v. Florida East Coast Ry. Co., 410 U.S. 224, 246 (1973)\u00a0\n* Perez v. Mortg. Bankers Ass\u2019n, 575 U.S. 92, 101 (2015)\u00a0\n* McDonald v. Watt, 653 F.2d 1035, 1042 (5th Cir. 1981)\u00a0\n* BNSF Ry. Co. v. Fed. R.R. Admin., 105 F.4th 691, 701 (5th Cir. 2024)\u00a0\n* Little Sisters, 591 U.S. at 683\u201384, 685\u201386 (citing 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 553(b))\u00a0\n* Bowen v. Georgetown Univ. Hosp., 488 U.S. 204, 221 (1988) (Scalia, J., concurring) (quoting Attorney General\u2019s Manual on the APA 14 (1947))\u00a0\n* City of Arlington, Tex. v. FCC, 668 F.3d 229, 243 (5th Cir. 2012)\u00a0\n* Qwest Servs. Corp. v. FCC, 509 F.3d 531, 536\u201337 (D.C. Cir. 2007)\u00a0\n* Am. Airlines, Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of Transp., 202 F.3d 788, 796\u201397 (5th Cir. 2000)\u00a0\n\nA quick meta-analysis shows that in administrative cases, conservative judges such as Judge Pittman tend to err on the side of allowing regulatory agencies to exercise their powers less striking legal transgressions. Intuitively, conservative judges would seek to intervene less in such disputes and refer to the experts and authorities; in this case, the FDA. Furthermore, closer scrutiny reveals Plaintiff\u2019s argument centered on Safari Club ignores marked differences between the rulemaking of the US Fish and Wildlife Services (USFWS) and the delisting by the FDA.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nIn Safari Club, USFWS concluded that killing of elephants did not meet the \u201cenhancement requirement\u201d under the existing Endangered Species Act (ESA), which stated that trophy hunting imports should be consistent with the conservation of the species. While the \u201cenhancement requirement\u201d was understood as a critical requirement, there was no specific mandate in the ESA categorically banning trophy imports that do not provide a net benefit to the species. Therefore, it was the USFWS\u2019s interpretation of the ESA that justified its policy to prohibit such imports and ban elephant trophy imports. This decision further involves the weighing of future conservation efforts because of trophy hunting, invoking a forward-looking, policy-oriented judgment as it weights future conservation efforts driven by future trophy hunting; prospective by nature and characteristic of rulemaking under the APA. Finally, the decision set a precedent for all future trophy imports, making it \u201capplicable across the board\u201d and \u201cgeneralized in nature\u201d, consistent with the rulemaking definition under the APA. We conclude the ruling of the USFWS decision as rulemaking is consistent with the APA.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nA comparison of the USFWS\u2019s trophy import ban in Safari with the FDA\u2019s delisting action then shows marked differences between the two, leading to the conclusion that the delisting action falls under informal adjudication. First and foremost, while USFWS made a prospective policy decision on future conservation and trophy hunting outcomes, and FDA\u2019s decision is fundamentally a factual decision based on current supply and demand dynamics. There is no prospective aspect related to the decision; the FDA\u2019s application of past data to existing drug shortage and compounding law to determine \u201ccurrent rights and liabilities\u201d is more consistent with adjudication under the APA. Furthermore, while the USFWS decision set precedence and created new policy applicable to all future trophy imports, the FDA\u2019s delisting directly alters current legal rights of compounders already outlined in existing legislation; no new, broad policy was created in the delisting process. Future drug shortages will still be determined by the FDA on a case-by-case basis. Again, this is consistent with adjudication under the APA.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe most intuitive argument is Perez vb. Mortg. Bankers Ass\u2019n, 575 U.S. 92, 101 (2015), which states that the APA \u201cmandate\\[s\\] that agencies use the same procedures when they amend or repeal a rule as they used to issue the rule in the first instance\u201d. Under the assumption that the delisting consisted of rulemaking, Perez guides that since the FDA did not engage in notice-and-comment when it listed Tirzepatide on the shortage list, it is not obligated to do so for the delisting.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe most convincing argument against Plaintiffs use of Safari Club is Vanda Pharms., Inc. v. FDA, 436 F. Supp. 3d 256, 270 n.4 (D.D.C. 2020), which rejected the argument that FDA\u2019s analysis of scientific literature in an adjudication applied to future cases such that it was a legislative rule, and noting that, unlike in Safari Club, the agency\u2019s analysis was \u201cin the context of adjudicating a particular set of disputed facts\u201d. Essentially, Vanda established that determinations of shortage status fit under adjudication of disputed facts.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe other core part of Plaintiff\u2019s arguments is how \u201c\\[t\\]he existence of a dispute concerning particular individuals is a distinguishing characteristic of adjudication.\u201d McDonald v. Watt, 653 F.2d 1035, 1042 (5th Cir. 1981). The key here is whether Tirzepatide compounders in general can be classified as \u201cparticular individuals\u201d. The FDA convincingly parries this argument using City of Arlington, Tex. v. FCC, 668 F.3d 229, 243 (5th Cir. 2012); Qwest Servs. Corp. v. FCC, 509 F.3d 531, 536\u201337 (D.C. Cir. 2007). The FDA argues that its delisting fits under a \u201cdeclaratory order\u201d, a type of adjudication which \u201c\\[has\\] binding legal effect and allow agencies to efficiently apply existing policy to a set of facts without the need for any particular party to risk penalty or sanction to resolve a dispute\u201d (FDA Opposition to PI, Case Doc 97, 2/20).\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nWeighing all the submitted records and arguments, the \u201csubstantial ink\u201d the OFA has spilled \"arguing that FDA should have engaged in notice-and-comment rulemaking\u201d (LLY Memo of Law in Opposition to PI Motion, Case Doc 89, 2/18) is exactly that \u2013 the odds are strongly against the OFA. We conclude that not only is the motion for preliminary injunction will likely not be granted by Judge Pittman, a non-zero probability exists for the injunction to be moot entirely should the entire case be decided within the month of March, before the compounding deadline of March 19^(th) set by the FDA.\u00a0\n\nSensitivity Analysis for OFA v. FDA (LLY)\u00a0\n\nLike the case itself, the implications for LLY depending on different ruling results are equally complex. To simplify, we designate two potential outcomes for LLY:\u00a0\n\n1. Courts grant motion for PI. Whether FDA/LLY appeals, compounders have another \\~6 months of legal compounding. We assign a \\~20% probability to this scenario. Stock trades down \\~0-3%, as the downside risk is the status quo, which we believe to be mostly priced into the stock (based on12/19 price action)\u00a0\n2. Courts deny motion for PI, or the PI is moot and the Judge rules in favor of FDA/LLY. Deadline of March 19^(th) becomes the effective end date of all legal compounding as the case plays out. We assign a \\~80% probability to this scenario. Stock trades up \\~5-10%, based on our SOTP valuation of LLY below in which we attribute around \\~75% of LLY market cap to its ex-Orfor GLP1 business, as well as our estimation of the GLP1 compounding market size to be \\~20-30% of the total GLP1 market (below).\u00a0\n\nWe view OFA v. FDA risks as mostly to the upside. While LLY supply capacity is a key area of focus, any de-risking of uncertainty around compounding is likely to benefit LLY. Quantitatively, we estimate the market compounders are currently capturing that will largely move under LLY\u2019s column under a positive ruling.\u00a0\n\n# Catalyst 2: Orforglipron Phase 3 ACHIEVE-1 Data\u00a0\n\nOrforglipron (Orfor) is an oral GLP1 agonist with potential to transform the diabetes and obesity market. Expected to reach market \\~2 years before any competitor orals, LLY will enjoy significant first-to-market advantage and further dominant share if successful. Top-line data from multiple Phase 3 (Ph3) trials are expected this year for Orfor, beginning with ACHIEVE-1 in April, which focuses on Orfor for patients with Type-2 Diabetes (T2D) (study [here](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05971940#study-plan)). The key metrics to focus on for the study are the:\u00a0\n\n1. Weight loss percentage: target of >7%, which implies weight loss for non-T2D obesity patients in the mid-teens, based on Tirzepatide T2D/Obesity comparison\u00a0\n2. Discontinuation rate, specifically due to adverse effects (AEs): target of <10%\u00a0\n3. HbA1C lowering profile (): target of >1.5%, which implies effectiveness in controlling blood sugar levels for T2D patients\u00a0\n\nTable 1. Trial Results and Targets for Oral/Injectable GLP1s\u00a0\n\n|| || |\u00a0|Weight Loss\u00a0\u00a0|Discontinuation Rate (due to AEs)\u00a0|HbA1C Lowering Profile\u00a0\u00a0|Weeks (Total, Titration)\u00a0| |Orfor Ph2 (T2D)\u00a0|8.2%\u00a0|15%\u00a0|1.8%\u00a0|26 (2-6 weeks)\u00a0| |Orfor Ph3 Targets (T2D)\u00a0|>7%\u00a0|<10%\u00a0|>1.5%\u00a0|40 (16 weeks)\u00a0| |Tirzepatide Ph2 (T2D)\u00a0|9.7%\u00a0|25%\u00a0|1.8%\u00a0|26 (2-6 weeks)\u00a0| |Tirzepatide Ph3 (T2D)\u00a0|9.1%\u00a0|7%\u00a0|2.0% (later trials up to 2.5%)\u00a0|40 (20 weeks)\u00a0| |Rybelsus Ph2 (NVO Oral)\u00a0|7%\u00a0|12%\u00a0|1.8-2%\u00a0|52 (26 weeks)\u00a0|\n\nMost critical to Orfor Ph3 success is being able to outperform a weight loss percentage of 7% while maintaining a discontinuation rate lower than 10%. There is reason for investors to be confident in Orfor Ph3 data at least meeting expectations considering precedence with comparable Tirzepatide Ph2 and Ph3 trials. LLY management has indicated that increasing the titration period in Tirzepatide Ph3 trials helped reduce discontinuation rates from 25% to 7%; Orfor Ph3 sees a comparable increase in titration from 2-6 weeks to 16 weeks. Furthermore, strong HbA1C and weight loss percentages readings in Ph2 data has been a strong indicator of consistency in Ph3 trials as well; a 5% deviation from the Ph2 8.2% weight loss puts Ph3 well above our target of 7%.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nAdditional confidence can be found in LLY management stockpiling a \u201cpre-launch inventory\u201d of over 550 MM worth of Orfor (article [here](https://www.tipranks.com/news/eli-lilly-lly-stockpiles-weight-loss-pill-ahead-of-regulatory-approval)) even before the first Ph3 trial data readout. The current stockpile would represent over 10 B in Orfor sales.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nSensitivity Analysis for Orfor Ph3 ACHIEVE-1\u00a0\n\nLike the OFA v. FDA catalyst, the market reactions for Orfor Ph3 data in April will be complex and nuanced. To simplify, we model it with three most likely scenarios:\u00a0\n\n1. Beating expectations. Weight loss >7%, HbA1C reduction >1.5%, and discontinuation rate due to AEs <10%. We assign a 70% probability to this case. Stock trades up \\~5-10% as we shift to an Orfor bull-case in addition to de-risking.\u00a0\n2. Meeting expectations. Weight loss \\~5-6%, HbA1C reduction \\~1-1.5%, and discontinuation rate due to AEs >10%. We assign a 20% probability to this case. Stock trades even at around \\~0-3% due to de-risking of Orfor.\u00a0\u00a0\n3. Missing expectations/failure. We assign a 10% probability to this case. Stock trades down \\~5-10%.\u00a0\n\nWe assign stock movements for Orfor Ph3 based on our SOTP valuation for LLY below, in which we attribute around \\~10% of LLY market cap to the Orfor pipeline.\u00a0\n\n# LLY SOTP Valuation\u00a0\n\nTable 2. LLY SOTP Valuation at $930/share implying an enterprise value of \\~860B.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n|| || |Business\u00a0|Enterprise Value\u00a0|Percentage of EV\u00a0|Equity Price/Share\u00a0| |Ex-Obesity/Diabetes\u00a0|170 B\u00a0|20%\u00a0|186\u00a0| |Orforglipron\u00a0|90 B\u00a0|10%\u00a0|93\u00a0| |GLP1 Ex-Orfor\u00a0|600 B\u00a0|70%\u00a0|651\u00a0| |Total\u00a0|860 B\u00a0|100%\u00a0|930\u00a0|\n\nWe break down LLY into three key segments for our SOTP valuation:\u00a0\n\n1. Ex-obesity/diabetes. Excluding obesity and diabetes, LLY pipelines and drugs, such as Kisunla for early-stage Alzheimer's, are also promising. This segment represents around \\~57% of FY24 revenue and around \\~20% of the enterprise value.\u00a0\u00a0\n2. GLP1 Ex-Orfor. Excluding Orfor, we price LLY to have \\~60% of the total GLP1 market across biopharmaceutical companies.\u00a0 OFA v. FDA is the main catalyst for this segment of the business, which can increase the total market by \\~20-30%. A conservative projection of LLY capturing 60% share of a GLP1 compound market shrunk by \\~50-75% due to price-demand elasticity gives between an \\~8-15% increase in GLP1 Ex-Orfor segment valuation, reflecting a \\~5-10% increase in share price on the conservative end.\u00a0\u00a0\n3. Orfor segment. We estimate that the market currently prices Orfor at 90 B, which implies LLY capturing \\~60% of the oral GLP1 market by 2033 with 12 B in Orfor sales at a probability of success (POS) of 70%. With a Ph3 de-risking of Orfor POS to around \\~90%, Orfor segment valuation in the base-case increases by \\~30% or around 27 B EV, reflecting a \\~3% increase in share price. However, it also increases the probability of the bull case in which LLY captures upwards of 75% share in the oral GLP1 market, which would command at least a 175 B valuation assuming conservatively that total oral GLP1 market does not increase as well, adding 85 B EV, reflecting a \\~10% increase in share price.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n# Price Target \u2013 Catalyst-Adjusted Valuation\u00a0\u00a0\n\nGiven significant confidence ahead of market consensus in both Catalyst 1 and 2 being positive for LLY, we use our SOTP and sensitivity analysis to drive our price target:\u00a0\n\n1. Catalyst 1 gives \\~5-10% share price increase at a POS of 80%, \\~0-3% share price decreases at a POS of 20%, reflecting a probability weighted \\~5.7% price increase.\u00a0\n2. Catalyst 2 gives \\~10% share price increase at a POS of 70%, a \\~3% share price increase at a POS of 20%, and a \\~10% share price decrease at a POS of 10%, reflecting a probability weighted \\~6.6% price increase\u00a0\n\nCombining these two catalysts, we derive a base-case upside of \\~12.5% for LLY, with a bull-case upside of \\~21%, reflecting a base-case PT of $1046 and a bull-case PT of $1135. We derive the bull case using a POS of 100% for both Catalyst 1 and 2.\u00a0\n\n# Other Considerations\u00a0\n\nGiven the current regulatory environment and political landscape, it would be imprudent to not address sector and market risks impacting LLY. Fortunately for LLY, their business and sector are not at the center of any significant prospective tariffs, making biotechnology relatively attractive from a market-risk perspective. Healthcare and biotechnology have been traditionally defensive plays during times of uncertainty, reflected in LLY\u2019s 0.47 beta despite its high valuation. A cursory comparison of the movements of LLY and the broader market in the past 1-2 weeks will demonstrate the low-beta nature of LLY. In fact, I believe a 0.47 beta overstates LLY\u2019s exposure to market risks.\u00a0\n\nThe pharmaceutical tariff of 25% as the Trump administration has floated would certainly impact LLY. However, LLY is also investing significantly (50 B pledged) in domestic manufacturing, and North American currently represents \\~73% of their total revenue. CEO David Ricks cites regulatory tailwinds, such as additional tax cuts on the 2017 Trump Tax Cut, as main motivators for the 50 B investment in the US. As a result, it is unclear whether the Trump administration will be a net benefit or detriment to LLY.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nLone Pine Capital\u00a0\n\nAs an interesting aside, Stephen Mandel\u2019s Lone Pine Capital, a hedge fund with both a Long Only and Long/Short arm, added a new, sizable position in LLY in 4Q24 according to their 13F filing [here](https://13f.info/13f/000090266425001072-lone-pine-capital-llc-q4-2024), and more clearly visualized [here](https://hedgefollow.com/funds/Lone+Pine+Capital). A long position of 782k shares at an average price of 828/share representing a position of 604 MM and 4.5% of their total portfolio indicates confidence in the company.\u00a0\n\n# Constructing the Trade\u00a0\n\nGiven our bullish stance on two significant catalysts in the upcoming \\~1-2 months, we position ourselves long with slightly OTM May25 1000c calls at \\~27 for maximum exposure to these catalysts. If we hold until expiry, the base-case PT of 1046 and the bull-case PT of 1135 represent a \\~72% and \\~405% return, respectively.\u00a0\n\nMy LLY Positions\u00a0\n\n[Positions from 3\\/3 - LLY down today to \\~910](https://preview.redd.it/4ce3n0cvstme1.png?width=1141&format=png&auto=webp&s=277bb0046528663948efd66c915953ba8f664956)\n\n\u00a0",

    "selftext": "TLDR:  WMT paints bleak picture of 2025, market goes down\n\n\nAlright guys, I\u2019ve got my FD\u2019s locked and loaded.  It\u2019s not a huge play, only 3K worth, but they\u2019re out the money and very short expiry.  I think WMT is going to tank the market tomorrow.  Walmart has historically been the \u201ccanary in the coal mine\u201d when it comes to the US economy.  Being the largest retailer, it gives a good snapshot into the overall health of the American consumer.  Because of this, I think Walmart\u2019s forecast tomorrow will be far bleaker than people are expecting, and the extremely out of touch stock market will get a reality check.  Here\u2019s why:\n\n\n1.  Consumers are tapped out.  Debt is at an all time high.  Delinquencies on credit cards and loans are at an all time high.  You may say, \u201cdoesn\u2019t this benefit Walmart since they are a discount retailer?\u201d  Absolutely, and we\u2019ve seen Walmart killing it for the last year for this reason.  Even higher income individuals have turned to Walmart to save money.  But at some point, people just don\u2019t have enough to spend on non-essentials.  So while Walmart continues to do fairly well, every other business begins to struggle and we start to hear rumblings of the R word.\n\n\n2.  Slowing retail sales.  We saw a 1% drop in sales in January when only a 0.2% drop was expected.  Thats fairly significant, especially for the most important retailer in the US.  Just another piece that says that people aren\u2019t spending nearly as much.  \n\n\n3.  Inflation.  It\u2019s back, and will get worse with the current administrations policies.  You may say \u201cwont that benefit businesses?\u201d.  Yes it can, but if no one has any more money to spend, it wont.  Remember, during Covid everyone was saving money.  We couldn\u2019t spend on experiences like bowling and cruises and what not.  Well over the past couple years, we HAVE been spending on experiences. A lot.  And not many people have much money left to spend on anything else.  So prices rising will mean greater costs for businesses, and they wont see the same spending patterns that they\u2019ve been seeing since 2021. \n\n\n4. Tariffs.  This is a known, but we don\u2019t know what they\u2019re going to say about their forecast regarding tariffs.  About 60-70% of Walmart\u2019s goods are imported from China.  Walmart accounts for 11% of ALL US imports from China.  These tariffs absolutely will affect them in some fashion.  Did they increase prices late last year to offset the cost?  Are they planning to increase soon?  We\u2019ll find out.  But one things is for sure: they will be increasing prices to strain an already overstrained consumer. \n\n\n5. Higher rates for longer.  I don\u2019t think we will see a cut this year.  We simply cannot.  The new administration will fight tooth and nail for it, but i dont see Powell budging.  Inflation will continue to rise as more workers are deported and business increase their prices to combat tariffs.  Higher rates means M2 will continue to decline, reduced borrowing, and reduced spending.   \n\n\n6.  Layoffs.   Walmart has recently cut over a thousand jobs.  This will probably be good thing for the company simply in terms of less costs, but they are one of many companies(Porsche, Salesforce, Workday, Amazon, Meta\u2026) that have laid off a very significant number of employees recently.  Again, good for the particular business, bad for the overall economy.  \n\n\n7.  Valuation.  Walmart has been on an insane tear all year.  It has been absolutely killing earnings, and honestly i think they\u2019ll kill this one.  But their guidance will be much softer than analysts are expecting.  Walmart\u2019s P/E ratio is 42.88, that multiple will likely have to be reset if guidance is not stellar enough to justify the current stock price.  \n\n\n8. Astrology.  For those that like crayons as much as i do, I\u2019ve included a few charts.  The main thing i want you to notice is the massive bearish divergences on WMT\u2019s daily AND weekly charts, as well as SPY and QQQ(which looks like the weaker of the two).   Volume on the indices has been non-existent as well.  By market close today, 24 million shares of SPY had been traded(more were traded after market).  I could only find 3 instances of the volume being that low since 2010.  And it\u2019s been like that for a few days.\n\n\nAll the signs of an impending recession are there, but the market has ignored everything so far.  I\u2019m betting 3K in FD\u2019s that the market starts taking those warnings seriously tomorrow and into Friday.  It is very likely I will lose this money, and that\u2019s ok, it\u2019s just for fun.  But I\u2019ll be very happy if I was able to put the pieces together and see this before it happens.   If you made it this far, I appreciate you reading.  ",

They did beat expectations, and beat by a lot. However, CONSECUTIVE multi-day post-earnings streaks historically don\u2019t tend to last, since all information is now public, and some investors choose to take profits. We\u2019re not talking about a post-earnings uptrend that lasts for weeks/months, but CONSECUTIVE GREEN days reacting to the SAME earnings release, with no further news. (Today\u2019s layoffs were also announced weeks ago.)\n\nThe other peculiar thing about this stock is it follows a similar chart pattern each day. It tends to rocket up first thing in the morning, followed by a steady mid-day/early afternoon selloff that takes it back to flat or even slightly negative. Then it gets bid up again in the last few hours for a positive close.\n\n[Look at the huge daily morning spikes!](https://preview.redd.it/g0ojl4oodeie1.jpg?width=1284&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1038843bea03b4f66c02c66ae3599bb9a17312c2)\n\nWe know Markie Z has been selling shares - tens of millions\u2019 worth every day, in fact, based on a preset executive trading plan: [https://in.benzinga.com/trading-ideas/long-ideas/25/02/43527542/meta-stock-soars-but-zuckerbergs-cashing-in-should-investors-worry](https://in.benzinga.com/trading-ideas/long-ideas/25/02/43527542/meta-stock-soars-but-zuckerbergs-cashing-in-should-investors-worry) But if markets were efficient, wouldn\u2019t they let him finish selling his shares before swooping in? They\u2019re paying a higher price than they\u2019d otherwise have to by bidding up the stock only so he could cash in at the best price. \n\nDoes anyone have a clue what\u2019s going on with this stock?",

    "selftext": "TL;DR: Estimating NVIDIA's Q4 FY2025\\* revenue from the capex of its four largest customers using linear regression results in an estimated revenue that is significantly higher than Wall Street's expectations.\n\n*\\*Note: Although it may sound confusing, NVIDIA is in fiscal year 2025 and will report its* [*Q4 FY2025 results on February 26, 2025*](https://investor.nvidia.com/events-and-presentations/events-and-presentations/default.aspx)*.*\n\n*This is the author\u2019s opinion only, not financial advice, and is intended for entertainment purposes only. The author holds a beneficial long position in NVIDIA Corporation. The author receives no compensation for writing this article and has no business relationship with any of the companies mentioned. The following analysis has been carefully conducted, but numbers or calculations may be incorrect, leading to potentially incorrect results.*\n\nNVIDIA will report its\u00a0Q4 FY2025 financial results on February 26. The consensus estimate for NVIDIA's Q4 revenue is\u00a0[$38.13 billion](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NVDA/analysis/?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAANOTJUpcAKXWdLKLCN4HDOw3xKM2mpDinXbx-3Ru72Xm5RtzQ8Qf0ruVaAPw61jJOwPbZHkqX9X2SRQvZJqafxEFMyTmQoFXdmxWLKJ-26YBEwQoOy5EcgpCEHOlmOzeyyZXGeSD-90RiaVAj_H8nFt0DtbA37mKFQUC-eGlN5tA). In the past two weeks, Microsoft, Meta, Alphabet, and Amazon, NVIDIA's largest customers, have reported earnings.\u00a0[One of the biggest headlines](https://www.ft.com/content/634b7ec5-10c3-44d3-ae49-2a5b9ad566fa)\u00a0was the announcement that these four companies plan to spend approximately $320 billion in capital expenditures (capex) through 2025:\n\n|Year|Meta|Alphabet|Microsoft|Amazon|Sum|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|2024 ($bn)|39.2|52.6|75.6|77.8|245.2|\n|2025 (planned, $bn)|65.0|75.0|80.0|100.0|320.0|\n\nMuch less attention was paid to the significant increase in capital expenditures by these companies last quarter:\n\n|Category|Meta|Alphabet|Microsoft|Amazon|Sum|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Last quarter reported ($bn)|14.425|14.276|15.804|27.834|72.339|\n|Previous quarter ($bn)|8.258|13.061|14.923|22.620|58.862|\n|Change from previous quarter|\\+74.7%|\\+9.3%|\\+5.9%|\\+23.1%|\\+22.90%|\n\nSince these 4 companies are the largest buyers of NVIDIA's GPUs, it makes sense to examine a correlation between these companies' quarterly capex and NVIDIA's quarterly revenue. For the last 7 quarters, we get a strong correlation coefficient of 0.95 (Pearson correlation). Now, if we use linear regression to estimate NVIDIA's revenue for the yet-to-be-reported Q4 2025 based on this data, we get quarterly revenue of $49.265 billion, which is more than $10 billion above the consensus analyst estimate.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fuwtgc4iv9ie1.png?width=2000&format=png&auto=webp&s=477315081203fddfa64c4744f2429c371c4a8041\n\nOf course, NVIDIA's GPUs account for only a portion of these 4 companies' reported capex. However, given the recent disappointing results from NVIDIA's competitor AMD, that portion may have increased. It could also be that a lot of datacenters have been built now and these costs were already incurred in previous quarters, leaving more capex for NVIDIA's GPUs - and the newly built datacenters should now have plenty of room for the upcoming Blackwell generation. Of course, companies like Alphabet are also building their own AI chips, but\u00a0they are much less cost-effective\u00a0than NVIDIA's Hopper generation and especially the upcoming Blackwell generation. Or as\u00a0[Amazon CEO Andy Jassy put it on an analyst call last week](https://www.barrons.com/articles/nvidia-stock-price-87ccceac?mod=RTA): \"*most AI compute has been driven by Nvidia chips, and we obviously have a deep partnership with Nvidia and will for as long as we can see into the future.*\" All in all, one could assume that the share of capex from these 4 companies going to NVIDIA may have even increased in the last quarter.\n\nIn addition, there are other major buyers of NVIDIA's GPUs: xAI, for example, has also purchased tens of thousands of NVIDIA's GPUs and built the massive supercomputer\u00a0[Colossus with 100,000 NVIDIA Hopper GPUs](https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/spectrum-x-ethernet-networking-xai-colossus). Another massive buyer of NVIDIA's GPUs has just formed with Project Stargate, which plans to invest a staggering\u00a0[$500 billion in new AI infrastructure](https://openai.com/index/announcing-the-stargate-project/)\u00a0over the next four years. All of this should continue to be a strong wind in NVIDIA's sails.\n\nMy positions: 200 NVIDIA shares.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j0g34hamv9ie1.jpg?width=1149&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e0f3896af535ba99a9f1c040540704712323d0ef",

    "selftext": "In the fiscal year 2024 Google\u2019s net profit was more than Apple. Google\u2018s revenue grew double digit while Apple was below 5%. It is the only AI company that is vertically integrated - from chips to compute to distribution. If TikTok didn\u2019t get banned, there is no chance in hell that US is breaking Google\u2019s Monopoly. \n\nIt behaves like a mature company. The stock isn\u2019t as volatile as Meta. The CEO doesn\u2019t abruptly change plans and plunge billions of dollars into random personal projects.\n\n\nIt is the only company that has self driving cabs running for probably almost 2 years now in multiple cities without any major issue . And let me be clear there is no second option till date. Every other company is just training or experimenting. A big assumption is that Elmo will change regulation to benefit from it for their Robo taxi operation, but the regulation isn\u2019t what is stopping Tesla from becoming a robot taxi company they haven\u2019t proven their tech yet. \n\nYes, AI might be something that could be disrupting or changing a lot of Google\u2019s original business. But it\u2019s not like their AI is completely shitty. It\u2019s still amongst the top and they have an ecosystem which can easily leverage this. I suspect Apple losing out on the market because of Apple Intelligence being subpar. Google will end up creating a personal AI because of the amount of personal data it has from all of us. No other company can do that because they just don\u2019t have access to all of this. \n\nGoogles search business was still growing at 10% per year. Even if the number of searches go down because people start using AI, we haven\u2019t seen any meaningful difference in Google usage so in the worst case, I would just assume that this business isn\u2019t growing for my calculation. But its AI would still accelerate Google cloud and YouTube. And the advertisers are not really going to AI company because they haven\u2019t figured out their business yet and for the time being it\u2019s going to be like a subscription based business. \n\nApple and Google are still going to benefit because of their ecosystem. It makes harder for anyone to leave them. This hasn\u2019t historically existed in my opinion when we look at other companies like yahoo or IBM.\n\nAnd the cherry on top is, it\u2019s the most undervalued big tech right now. ",

    "title": "Let's talk about META's earnings.",
    "selftext": "Zuckerberg's earnings are today and I wanted to drop my 2 cents and see if anyone's up to discuss. I'm re-writing to better along with WSB's rules. I recently tried to make a post about Tesla but it was taken down too by an AI bot for being too political? This is my first discussion post so I'm really testing out the waters on this sub. \n\nMeta Platforms is set to announce its fourth-quarter results after the market closes and from what I've read analysts are predicting earnings of $6.76 per share, up from $5.33 a year ago. Revenue is expected to hit $47.04 billion, marking a 17% increase year-over-year. Right now it seems like people are particularly keen to see how Meta's hefty investments in artificial intelligence are paying off.\n\nUnfortunately for Meta, DeepSeek has been making waves with its R1 model. It's a Chinese competitor that matches the capabilities of models from U.S. giants like OpenAI and Meta but was developed at a fraction of the cost. DeepSeek's success has sent shockwaves through the tech industry, causing significant stock drops for companies like Nvidia. It's pretty common for China to steal proprietary tech and incorporate it into their own creations, but their AI is entirely open source, unlike OpenAI. This would allow American companies to, in turn, take their new research and work with it. For those who don't know, Meta themselves has an Open-Source Strategy. Their Cheif AI Scientist, Yann LeCun isn't sweating it, though. DeepSeek's R1 is open-source, just like Meta's own Llama model, which in turn validates Meta's open-source approach. Collaboration and transparency might be the goal in the AI race. However, people are wondering how such advancements could be made with such a low budget. This puts into question the amount of funding and money that's currently going into AI.\n\nDespite the DeepSeek-induced drop, Meta's stock has shown resilience. Analysts at Citi argue that Meta could actually benefit from DeepSeek's innovations by incorporating them to enhance its own AI tools, potentially leading to more efficient operations and better returns on investment. As Meta prepares to unveil its earnings, everyone wants to see how the company plans to monetize its AI investments and respond to the rising competition from players like DeepSeek. The tech landscape is shifting, and Meta's next moves could set the tone for the industry's future.\n\nBut the earning call won't be entirely about AI. They obviously own Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. Advertising remains the cornerstone of Meta's revenue, accounting for approximately 98% of its total income. I believe Meta's significant investments in artificial intelligence have enhanced its advertising capabilities. AI-powered tools like Advantage+ and generative AI enable advertisers to create highly targeted campaigns, leading to increased return on ad spend. The company reported a 7% year-over-year increase in ad impressions and an 11% rise in average ad prices. Over a million businesses utilized Meta's generative AI tools to produce 15 million ads in a single month, resulting in a 7% uplift in conversions.\n\nMeta's platforms continue to see robust user engagement. The company boasts 3.29 billion daily active users, a 5% increase from the previous year. AI-enhanced content recommendations have driven higher engagement, particularly for video content, thereby boosting advertising opportunities. However, Despite these positive indicators, Meta faces several challenges. The company's Reality Labs division, focused on metaverse initiatives, is expected to report a $5 billion loss for Q4, continuing to weigh on overall profitability. Additionally, regulatory scrutiny, such as the European Union\u2019s Digital Markets Act, poses risks to Meta's data-driven advertising model, potentially leading to increased compliance costs and fines. Competition from platforms like TikTok, Google, and Amazon remains intense, with TikTok's popularity among younger users particularly threatening Meta's growth in key demographics. Although Tiktok's impending ban might really help them monopolize the social media industry.\n\nEverything is telling me that earnings will be bullish. Thoughts?",

    "selftext": "> Microsoft Corp. and OpenAI are investigating whether data output from OpenAI\u2019s technology was obtained in an unauthorized manner by a group linked to Chinese artificial intelligence startup DeepSeek, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\n> Microsoft\u2019s security researchers in the fall observed individuals they believe may be linked to DeepSeek exfiltrating a large amount of data using the OpenAI application programming interface, or API, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential. Software developers can pay for a license to use the API to integrate OpenAI\u2019s proprietary artificial intelligence models into their own applications.\n\n> Microsoft, an OpenAI technology partner and its largest investor, notified OpenAI of the activity, the people said. Such activity could violate OpenAI\u2019s terms of service or could indicate the group acted to remove OpenAI\u2019s restrictions on how much data they could obtain, the people said.\n\n> DeepSeek earlier this month released a new open-source artificial intelligence model called R1 that can mimic the way humans reason, upending a market dominated by OpenAI and US rivals such as Google and Meta Platforms Inc. The Chinese upstart said R1 rivaled or outperformed leading US developers\u2019 products on a range of industry benchmarks, including for mathematical tasks and general knowledge \u2014 and was built for a fraction of the cost. The potential threat to the US firms\u2019 edge in the industry sent technology stocks tied to AI, including Microsoft, Nvidia Corp., Oracle Corp. and Google parent Alphabet Inc., tumbling on Monday, erasing a total of almost $1 trillion in market value.\n\n> David Sacks, President Donald Trump\u2019s artificial intelligence czar, said Tuesday there\u2019s \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d that DeepSeek leaned on the output of OpenAI\u2019s models to help develop its own technology. In an interview with Fox News, Sacks described a technique called distillation whereby one AI model uses the outputs of another for training purposes to develop similar capabilities.\n\n> \u201cThere\u2019s substantial evidence that what DeepSeek did here is they distilled knowledge out of OpenAI models and I don\u2019t think OpenAI is very happy about this,\u201d Sacks said, without detailing the evidence.\n\n> In a statement responding to Sacks\u2019 comments, OpenAI didn\u2019t directly address his comments about DeepSeek. \u201cWe know PRC based companies \u2014 and others \u2014 are constantly trying to distill the models of leading US AI companies,\u201d an OpenAI spokesperson said in the statement, referring to the People\u2019s Republic of China. \u201cAs the leading builder of AI, we engage in countermeasures to protect our IP, including a careful process for which frontier capabilities to include in released models, and believe as we go forward that it is critically important that we are working closely with the US government to best protect the most capable models from efforts by adversaries and competitors to take US technology.\u201d",

    "selftext": "ALTERNATIVE SOURCE \u2014 Bloomberg: Nvidia Corp.\u2019s plunge, fueled by investor concern about Chinese artificial-intelligence startup DeepSeek, erased a record amount of stock-market value from the world\u2019s largest company. \n\nNvidia shares tumbled 17% Monday, the biggest drop since March 2020, erasing $589 billion from the company\u2019s market capitalization. That eclipsed the previous record \u2014 a 9% drop in September that wiped out about $279 billion in value \u2014 and was the biggest in US stock-market history. \n\nThe drop rippled through the rest of the market due to how much weight Nvidia has in major indexes. Including Monday\u2019s slump, Nvidia selloffs have caused eight of the top ten biggest one-day drops in the S&P 500 Index, based on market value, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The S&P 500 fell 1.5% Monday and the Nasdaq 100 tumbled nearly 3%.\n\nThe semiconductor maker led a broader selloff in technology stocks after DeepSeek\u2019s low-cost approach reignited concerns that big US companies have poured too much money into developing artificial intelligence. The Chinese firm appears to provide a comparable performance at a fraction of the price. \n\nThe latest AI model of DeepSeek, released last week, is widely seen as competitive with those of OpenAI and Meta Platforms Inc. The open-sourced product was founded by quant-fund chief Liang Wenfeng and is now at the top of Apple Inc.\u2019s App Store rankings. \n\n\u201cConcerns have immediately emerged that it could be a disruptor to the current AI business model, which relies on high end chips and extensive computing power and hence energy,\u201d Jefferies analysts said in a note to clients.\n\nNvidia has been the biggest beneficiary of the influx in spending on AI because they design semiconductors used in the technology. While that heavy spending looks poised to continue, investors may grow wary of rewarding companies that aren\u2019t showing a sufficient return on the investment. \n\nMeta announced plans on Friday to boost capital expenditures on AI projects this year by about half to as much as $65 billion, sending its shares to a record high. That came on the heels of OpenAI, SoftBank Group Corp. and Oracle Corp. announcing a $100 billion joint venture called Stargate to build out data centers and AI infrastructure projects around the US. \n\nIn a bid to stall China\u2019s progress in AI, the US has banned the export of advanced semiconductor technologies to the country and is limiting sales of advanced Nvidia AI chips to others. But DeepSeek\u2019s progress suggests Chinese AI engineers have found a way to work around the export bans, focusing on greater efficiency with limited resources.\n\nNvidia said in a statement Monday that DeepSeek\u2019s model is an \u201cexcellent AI advancement\u201d and indicated that the Chinese company didn\u2019t violate US restrictions that limit access to advanced US chips in creating its technology. It also added that inference, or the work of running AI models, requires \u201crequires significant numbers of Nvidia GPUs and high-performance networking.\u201d\n\n",

    "selftext": "BofA: 'DeepSeek Concerns Overblown in AI Semis; but Foundational Models Keep Demand High'\n\n \"On January 20, China-based AI lab DeepSeek created a mini-flurry in the AI semiconductor space by releasing a free, open-source R1 model that reportedly outperforms leading Western AI models, such as OpenAI's GPT-4. The model's creators claimed it took only two months and less than $6 million to build using older-generation NVIDIA H800 chips.\n\nIf accurate, this advancement suggests model usefulness and accuracy might not scale directly with compute/memory/networking, potentially reducing the demand for expensive AI chips. However, we believe this concern about slowing AI scaling is overstated. Based on available data, DeepSeek's model appears to be a 'distilled' model relying on larger foundation models like Meta's open-source Llama.\n\nIt is these foundational LLMs where significant and rising infrastructure costs are incurred, as evidenced by Meta's plan to raise CY25E capex by over 56% year-over-year to $60-$65 billion. In our view, we will continue to see increasing compute demand driven by a mix of large foundational models (both proprietary and open-source), derivative models (leveraging techniques such as knowledge distillation, sparse attention, and low-rank factorization), and inference at scale across diverse cloud, enterprise, and sovereign AI customers.\n\nWe maintain our Buy ratings on NVIDIA (NVDA), Broadcom (AVGO), and Marvell Technology (MRVL).\"\n\nJPMorgan analyst Sandeep Deshpande: \"Investors are concerned that rather than impede China's progress in AI, the US restrictions have engendered innovation that has enabled the development of a model that prioritises efficiency. ... The news over the past few months has been about the huge capex announcements of Microsoft, which is spending $80bn in '25, while Meta recently announced investments between $6bn and $65bn. Open AI also announced that the Stargate project intends to invest $500m over the next four years building new AI infrastructure in the US. Thus, with these considerable sums flowing into AI investments in the US, that Deepseek's highly efficient and lower resource-intensive AI model has shown such significant innovation and success is posing thoughts to investors that the AI investment cycle may be over-hyped and a more efficient future is possible.\" \n\nJefferies analyst Edison Lee: \"Re-evaluating computing power needs could cause 2026 AI Capex to fall (or not grow)...We believe DS's success could drive two possible industry strategies: 1) still pursue more computing power to drive even faster model improvements, and 2) refocus on efficiency and ROI, meaning lower demand for computing power as of 2026.\" \n\nBernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon: \"Is DeepSeek doomsday for AI buildouts? We don't think so...we believe that 1) DeepSeek DID NOT \"build OpenAI for $5M\"; 2) the models look fantastic but we don't think they are miracles; and 3) the resulting Twitterverse panic over the weekend seems overblown.\" Though Rasgon acknowledged DeepSeek's models are good. The analyst kept his outperform ratings on Nvidia and Broadcom, advising clients not to buy into the doomsday scenarios. \n\nCiti analyst Malik: \"While the dominance of the US companies on the most advanced AI models could be potentially challenged, that said, we estimate that in an inevitably more restrictive environment, US' access to more advanced chips is an advantage. Thus, we don't expect leading AI companies would move away from more advanced GPUs.\" Malik maintained a buy rating on Nvidia . \n\nRaymond James' semiconductor analyst Srini Pajjuri: \"If DeepSeek's innovations are adopted broadly, an argument can be made that model training costs could come down significantly even at U.S. hyperscalers, potentially raising questions about the need for 1-million XPU/GPU clusters as projected by some...: A more logical implication is that DeepSeek will drive even more urgency among U.S. hyperscalers to leverage their key advantage (access to GPUs) to distance themselves from cheaper alternatives.\" Pajjuri reiterated buy ratings on Nvidia and ASML. \n\nCantor analyst C.J. Muse: \"Following release of DeepSeek's V3 LLM, there has been great angst as to the impact for compute demand, and therefore, fears of peak spending on GPUs. We think this view is farthest from the truth and that the announcement is actually very bullish with AGI seemingly closer to reality and Jevons Paradox almost certainly leading to the AI industry wanting more compute, not less.\" Muse said buy Nvidia on any weakness.",

    "selftext": "If you were following the Supreme Court yesterday, the message was pretty clear: they\u2019re unlikely to step in and reverse PAFACA to save TikTok. Without their intervention, the only way for Trump to save TikTok would be through lobbying Congress to change legislation\u2014executive orders alone won\u2019t cut it. While META (Instagram Reels) and GOOG (YouTube Shorts) might see some short-term benefit, I\u2019m betting that ILLR/ILLRW will be the biggest winner in the long run. Their low share price, combined with the potentially massive impact on their business, positions them perfectly to fill the TikTok-shaped gap in the market. With their leadership under Sean Kim and their ability to replicate much of TikTok\u2019s experience, Triller could be the closest thing to a true replacement.\n\nSean Kim, the former Head of Product at TikTok, is now leading Triller as its CEO, and his vision for the platform couldn\u2019t come at a better time. Kim was instrumental in developing TikTok\u2019s groundbreaking algorithm and monetization system, two features that made TikTok the platform of choice for content creators. Now at Triller, he\u2019s leveraging that expertise to build a platform designed to empower creators with similar (and potentially improved) tools for content discovery and revenue generation. This week, Triller launched a new app that helps creators seamlessly migrate their TikTok content directly to Triller, signaling a bold move to capture creators and their audiences amidst the uncertainty surrounding TikTok\u2019s future.\n\nWith TikTok potentially banned in the U.S. as early as next week, platforms like YouTube Shorts and Instagram Reels will likely see an influx of users. However, creators and audiences will quickly notice these platforms are more censored and lack the strong monetization systems they\u2019ve come to expect. That leaves Triller perfectly positioned to fill the gap. By offering a less restrictive environment and a focus on creator earnings, Triller has the tools, leadership, and timing to become the go-to alternative. Beyond the app, Triller\u2019s other solutions add even more value: TrillerTV offers live-streamed content including influencer-driven shows and sports events like Bare Knuckle Fighting Championship, while its AI-driven Brain Suite provides creators with data and tools to optimize content performance and grow their audiences. Together, these features create a robust ecosystem for creators to thrive.\n\nRight now, Triller\u2019s stock (ILLR) is trading around $2.50, with its warrants (ILLRW) available at an even lower cost, offering leveraged upside for investors willing to take a chance. Buying both the stock and the warrants could be a strategic move for those betting on Triller\u2019s success. With its combination of innovative leadership, a creator-first approach, and diversified offerings like TrillerTV and Brain Suite, Triller presents a unique opportunity to capitalize on the rapidly changing social media landscape. For investors, the potential upside is hard to ignore.",

    "selftext": "Edit: people seem to be misunderstanding my post I mainly intend to do paper trading until I can get my skills to be a bit better. The goal is just to understand the market more.\n\nWell to tell my tale I should start by saying I have been investing for a while. Started with penny stocks with 2k, dwindled it 0. And then put it in long term in 2022 and made a shit ton on nvda, meta and few other stocks. \n\nAt some point I started observing NVDA closely and also got indocrtianted to options. So during the earnings in May/June 2023, I put 7k into NVDA on an OTM contract, made shit ton. And then lost a shit ton on other earning plays and made everything and a bit more on AVGO a month later, making my net worth 48k. \n\n48k is pre crazy, and I made some dumb trades and eventually got that close to 0. And to get everything back quickly I pumped 6k more, and pretty soon lost it all. While I am working and this is my savings this doesn't in anyway affect my daily life. But it hurts my ego quite a bit. \n\nI wanted to do more revenge trading, but losing 18k puts things into perspective, so I decided maybe not doing what I am doing is probably something to consider.\n\nSince September I have been just looking at charts and reading patterns, and I have basically gotten good at reading NVDA to a certain extent. And over the last month (since early dec) I invested another $1000 and I am on a goal to make it to $18,000. Which I have done well with and its close to $2500. \n\nBut I realize I need to be able to understand and learn a bit more about the market to scale this, and have a better idea on when to do what.\n\nSo I am coming with a plan for myself to kind of understand the basics, so far what I have in the pipeline to look into:\n\n1. What really is a stock, what dictates its movement?\n2. Understand what the many stats you see in we bull/fin viz and etc about a stock and how they affect a stock. (Not sure how to correlate them, but that's part of the challenge)\n3. Look into observable and recurring patterns I can take advantage of:\n   1. Trying to make a quick buck out of IV dropping post earnings.\n   2. See indicators of what make the market move up.\n   3. Predicting if strong stocks can move the entire industry and if there are affiliates that move along side it to take advantage of unrealized gain from them.\n   4. Understanding Options better, calls, puts, and selling them. And how the greeks affect them.\n\nThis is just me spitballing, but if anyone who has been successful with short term trading in the long term wants to give me tips, or any changes to what I have above or have resources to offer, I would very much appreciate it.\n\nNow along side this I am a computer science grad so this is something of a side project to me, I am looking to see if I can build an app for myself mainly to see if I can emulate a time for any stock from months ago and let the stock move in real time but from a time you set into the past.\n\nFor example set NVDA to Jan 2nd 2025 at 9AM and watch it move second by second for practice with pattern analysis when doing weekly. Alongside that possible scrapping to see data from months ago and seeing if I can create something of a algo to predict stock movements from months as if it hasn't yet happened. \n\nMost of  the ideas are very unrefined but this is my honest effort to do better than the gambling I lost in. Any advice is appreciated.",

    "selftext": "Right now, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, and Meta are all spending more than Nvidia on R&D and are developing their own AI chips. Tesla, and AMD are also developing AI chips. Right now, tech companies are only buying Nvidia's chips to get started and build market share, because they do not want to fall behind their competition. \n\nUsing Nvidia's chips at current prices is not profitable, even successful AI companies such as OpenAI fail to achieve positive operating margins despite a highly popular product with paid features. Large tech companies are reluctantly buying Nvidia's hardware to avoid falling behind their competition in market share. But relying on Nvidia long term is never the intention, these companies need to be profitable eventually, Nvidia is just there to get them started.\n\nThe thing is, Nvidia's 74.56% gross margin is a strength, but its also a vulnerability. It demonstrates that any AI company that can cut out Nvidia can significantly reduce their costs, and that's why everyone is building their own chips. They don't need to be faster than Nvidia to succeed, they just need to be fast enough to provide services at a lower cost, which is quite a low bar. Developing new products takes time, which is why Nvidia's windfall has lasted. But give it 1-3 more years and you'll start to see the impact on Nvidia's sales.\n\nWith everyone rushing to develop their own chips, and all of them relying on TSMC, TSMC has the true windfall. They will certainly be able to hike their prices on wafers due to increased demand, which will hurt Nvidia's margins.\n\nIntel was once a dominant and unstoppable player in the semiconductor space, but then they got too comfortable and started spending their cash flow on dividends and stock buybacks instead of reinvesting in R&D. We see how that played out, with AMD catching up and stealing market share, and now Intel is struggling. No moat is impenetrable.\n\nNvidia is following in Intel's footsteps with their $50 Billion stock buyback plan at 50x earnings. Despite facing competition from the largest tech companies with deep pockets, they are spending their record windfall just to buy back less than 2% of their shares outstanding. This will be their downfall. They are not hedging their reliance on TSMC by seeking to acquire or develop their own fab business, they are not increasing R&D sufficiently to stay ahead of their competition. This will be their downfall.\n\nIn 5-10 years, Nvidia will almost certainly have thinner margins and less market share in the AI space as their customers develop their own in-house solutions. At best, Nvidia will be relied upon for niche applications where performance is essential.",

I\u2019m not sure if this is already a strategy so my bad if it is.\n\nit\u2019s self explanatory but waiting for a golden cross (or death cross) and buying a LEAPS.\n\nI was basically wondering what are some issues with this strategy if anyone\u2019s tried something similar, apart from the obvious like the lagging affect because it\u2019s an AVERAGE indicator\u2026that\u2019s obvious and is a very glaring issue but has anyone tried this strategy and found ways to get around the lag? or is this strategy just not viable if not paired with other indicators/TA\n\nthe reason i thought about this was growth stocks like meta, apple, google and most recently costco had golden crosses and have gone up so high. costcos last golden cross was at like $887 or so and it\u2019s now trading at \\~$980 to $1000.\n\nObviously the longer you let a LEAPS run solely based off an AVERAGE indicator, the more risk your taking on cause it could very well cause a late exit and loss in profit. but what about doing maybe a month of price movement, and exiting?\n\nwould a golden cross LEAPS strategy not be viable? why or why not? i\u2019d love to hear everyone\u2019s thoughts!",

    "selftext": "https://preview.redd.it/hbzkp23fz26e1.png?width=3840&format=png&auto=webp&s=698c4992c16ee91fc7afc47c3a28e81add772ebc\n\nUnity Software Inc. (doing business as\u00a0**Unity Technologies**) is a technology company that specializes in developing and operating a platform for creating real-time 3D content and experiences. Unity is primarily known for its game engine and development tools, which allow creators to build, run, and monetize interactive 2D and 3D content across various platforms.\n\nTheir engine and development tools is used in wide range of industries including Video game development , architecture and design , automotive , film and animation , and virtual and augmented reality.\n\nThey are a duopoly in the game engine market with Epic Games (Unreal Engine). Unity holds approximately 40-50% of the game engine market share, while Unreal Engine accounts for 10-20%. As of 2023, over 70% of the top mobile games globally were developed using Unity's platform. In 2024, mobile gaming is expected to generate approximately $92.6 billion in revenue compared to $51.9 billion for console gaming and $40 billion for PC gaming. As of 2024, a significant portion of VR apps in the Apple Store are likely created using Unity, with estimates suggesting that\u00a0over 60%\u00a0of AR/VR content across platforms is made with Unity.\n\nUnity's stock have been doing poorly ever since the great 2022 bear market , the John Riccitiello fee incident (2022) , and the dreadful IronSource purchase (2022) under his tenure. They have since fired him in 2023 and appointed Matthew Bromberg as Unity's new Chief Executive Officer, President, and a member of the Unity Board of Directors, effective May 15, 2024. Bromberg has since replaced all the C-suites with competent people. They did a reset on their portfolio to put their focus on their core business which they refer to as their \"Strategic Portfolio\": the Engine, Cloud and Monetization.\n\nThe Strategic Portfolio consists of two main segments:\n\n* Create Solutions: This segment encompasses Unity's game development platform and tools. In Q3 2024, Create Solutions revenue grew 5% year-over-year, driven by subscription growth. The Create segment includes:\n\n1. Unity game engine and development tools\n2. Unity 6, the latest version of the engine with over 500,000 downloads\n3. Expansion into non-gaming industries (Industry segment), which grew **59% year-over-year and represents 18% of Create revenue**\n\n* Grow Solutions: This segment includes advertising and monetization tools. In Q3 2024, Grow Solutions revenue declined by 5%. It focuses on:\n\n1. Advertising technology\n2. Monetization services for game developers\n3. Development of a new advertising model set to launch in 2025\n\nLet's discuss the mobile gaming monetization and advertising space and their competitor AppLovin (the stock that is up 768% YTD) . AppLovin wanted to buy Unity for $20B back in 2022 to form a monopoly but got rejected. Unity has since failed to keep up with AppLovin who is now the third largest mobile gaming in-app advertising network after Google and Meta. Unity-ironSource platform couldn't compete with AppLovin's platform but things are about to change because the new CEO hired Jim Payne to join the company as Chief Product Officer for Advertising effective August 12, 2024. Payne co-founded MoPub, the world\u2019s largest mobile in-app ad server and exchange, and MAX Advertising Systems, a mobile header bidding platform (both acquired by AppLovin and are essential pieces to their success). In their latest earning's call Bromberg said they have a new machine learning model in their new neural network that is being tested on their live data that will be ready to launch when it's ready (probably sometime next year). APP's current mcap is $111B while Unity is at $10.78B , if their new ML model is competitive , the stock can easily **10x from here just from the Grow Solutions business**. This is why some people are looking to short AppLovin and long Unity.\n\nOn the Create Solution side Unity recently announced on Oct 30, 2024 they hired Ex-King CTO and Havok Co-Founder Steve Collins as CTO which will add key technical leadership to accelerate product innovation, quality, and stability.  In 2023, Havok products were used in twelve of the top twenty best selling video games in the United States. Their 3D engine is utilized not only for game development but also by a diverse range of clients in non-gaming industries for real-time product visualization, virtual prototyping, AR customer experiences, digital twins and other 3D applications. This segment grew 59% year-over-year and is expected to become an increasingly significant contributor to their Create revenue in the future.\n\n[Palantir's Mixed Reality offerings are built with Unity's 3D engine. They are just one of several partners from industries outside of gaming. https:\\/\\/www.palantir.com\\/offerings\\/mixed-reality\\/](https://preview.redd.it/zw7w2aj2z26e1.png?width=2379&format=png&auto=webp&s=f4f900c7489db3c6841321cb494c66a8c0035add)\n\nUnity's engine and development tools is also utilized by the The Department of Defense (DoD). They primarily use the Unity engine to create realistic, immersive virtual training simulations for military personnel, allowing them to practice complex scenarios in a safe and controlled environment across various domains like combat tactics, vehicle operation, war simulations and situational awareness, all within a 3D digital world.\n\nUnity Technologies Corporation (UnityTec) has been awarded two significant contracts related to the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD):\n\n* [JETS 2.0 Contract](https://govtribe.com/opportunity/federal-contract-opportunity/dla-j6-enterprise-technology-services-jets-2-dot-0-sp470923r0001-45) : UnityTec secured a position on the Defense Logistics Agency's J6 Enterprise Technologies Services 2.0 (JETS 2.0) multiple-award, Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity contract. This contract has a maximum value of $12 billion and will provide a broad range of IT-related services to the entire DoD for up to 12 years.\n* CACI Contract: Unity signed a \"multi-million dollar\" contract with enterprise technology firm CACI to become the \"preferred real-time 3D platform\" for U.S. government defense projects.\n\nNow back in 2015 [Mark Zuckerberg sent a four page internal email](https://sriramk.com/memos/zuck-unity.pdf) to key executives to get in early on the AR and VR future. In that email , Mark Zuckerberg wanted to purchase Unity because he believes AR/VR is the major computing platform after mobile and they will gain control over a key development platform for AR/VR content. He believes the acquisition of Unity would also mitigate the risk of a competitors like Google and Apple from acquiring them and limiting Meta (Facebook then) access to the platform. One of the possible reasons the acquisition fell through is antitrust concerns because Meta would be a monopoly in VR/AR if they own Unity.\n\nI believe the future is XR (extended reality) and that XR will be next major and **final computing platform** after mobile. I believe Meta could potentially become the largest company in the world within the next 10-20 years if Apple/Google/Microsoft don't catch up in XR especially in AR which Meta is leading. Regardless of who wins, **Unity will be a key pillar driving the XR gold rush**. In conclusion, I\u2019m highly optimistic about Unity, as they hold a vital role in the XR ecosystem. This is a long-term investment for generational wealth.\n\nThis post is made for posterity.\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/ohx7bzjg16ie1.gif\n\nPositions:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/73iy0b8qu6ce1.png?width=2431&format=png&auto=webp&s=7996f5bdb6e650c8f398c1b41fa3bb103d38bd41",

    "selftext": "Hear me out. I'm not coming at this from a technical or fundamental perspective, so there are some things to explain for those that don't understand. But also want to hear others perspectives, even the bears (respectfully if possible hah)\n\nI'm not a trader by any means. I'm in Reddit because my background is giving me some new perspective on the potential. \n\nMy background is in SEO (search engine optimization). I know the search engines. I know how websites are monetized. I've seen hundreds of millions of dollars pass through the hands of clients, bloggers, ecom stores I've owned, CPA offers and leveraging social media, etc etc \n\nThere's an endless supply of money on the web via ad revenue, product referrals, and money to be had without actually selling a thing. If you don't understand how ad revenue is generated on the web, it similar to traditional advertising models. Traditionally you would charge by CPM (cost per 1000 impressions). An impression is simply someone seeing an ad. For example if a billboard company sells you an ad space it's based on the amount of people that travel down the freeway. So if the freeway has 10k traffic everyday thats 10k impressions a day and the advertising company sets a price for the CPM. \n\nWith the web you have more avenues to monetize. But the majority of monetizing with ads is via CPCs and CPM. CPC = cost per click. We can get into marketing funnels and offers and yada yada but thats not how a company like Reddit is going to monetize. I've seen little dinky websites that leverage ranking web pages for keywords in Google make big $$. One example is a DUI attorney I worked with in Phoenix who had a blog. So you understand how blog monetization works just go to any blog and look at their ads on the page, and possible affiliate links inside of the content. Anyhow, for the DUI attorney his ads in the side bar of his blog were earning him on average $40 per click. Everytime someone clicked an ad on his page he made approx $40. \"dui attorney phoenix\" currently has a range of $30 - $225 per click and get and avg of $82 per click as one example. His adsense account made $10k a month roughly on a blog that was getting about $20k in monthly traffic. Reddit has 1.2 billion in unique organic visitors every month. And growing\n\nReddit is in it's infancy when it comes to monetizing their traffic and really leverging their ads such as a company like Facebook/Meta.\n\nHowever, it has more organic traffic than Amazon. Last I checked Reddit was fluctuating between #5 and #7 in terms of sites with the largest traffic. \n\nAmazon IPO'd at $18 a share. They adjusted shares 480x (not sure if that number is 100% correct, but I think it is) which means the current share price since IPO without splits is about $99k per share. \n\nIf Reddit closes the gaps in 3 areas...\n\nDials in their ad monetization  \nLaunches a Marketplace  \nCapitalizes on local search traffic\n\nIt's my opinion this could easily be $1000+ a share. Market cap is a measly 25 bil. \n\nNOT FINANCIAL ADVICE this is only my outlook based on the possibility with leveraging search traffic and monetizing it, the possibility that being the 5th largest traffic driver on the web brings, and why I'm invested.

Also I bought on the dip today and if the stock rises until end of day I'll probably sell before close because what's better than maybe making more money from earnings?

Companies see this, and will spend whatever it takes to build AGI. This creates a generational investment opportunity, particularly in two key areas: foundation model companies and datacenter infrastructure plays. I'm deploying \\~$100K with this thesis. I'd love your thoughts on this, and am looking to incorporate feedback.\n\n**The Thesis:**\n\nWe are witnessing the early stages of perhaps the most significant technological revolution in human history. The evidence suggests we're approaching an inflection point in artificial intelligence that will reshape the entire economy. Here's why this matters for investors:\n\n**Key Technical Developments:**\n\n* Transformer architecture has fundamentally solved previous algorithmic and data constraints\n* Larger models consistently demonstrate superior capabilities\n* Critical breakthrough in reasoning capabilities (building on techniques from game theory/poker)\n* Major capability jumps expected with upcoming models (GPT-5, Gemini-2)\n\nBusiness Implications:\n\n1. The Prize: Human intelligence and agency have historically been the greatest constraints on economic growth. AGI would effectively remove these constraints.\n2. Follow the Money:\n   * Current AI capex spending at big tech companies is >$150B annually\n   * For comparison: The tech bubble peak saw $250B/year in broadband infrastructure in today\u2019s dollars\n   * Unlike the tech bubble, today's AI investments are being made by cash-rich tech giants with fortress balance sheets\n   * Training next-gen models will require hundreds of billions in compute investment\n3. The Economics Are Compelling:\n   * Leading tech companies each generate $100B+ in annual revenue\n   * They can invest off their balance sheet with extremely low cost of debt\n   * Early evidence shows strong ROI on AI investments (e.g., Microsoft/OpenAI revenue growth)\n\n  \n**Investment Strategy:** I'm deploying $100K across foundation model companies and datacenter infrastructure, with a small allocation to energy. Here's the detailed breakdown:\n\n[Overall Portfolio](https://preview.redd.it/9atytvnu6lxd1.png?width=1900&format=png&auto=webp&s=9da96520090f2e014f5f1bd82af30eb67c1a8fca)\n\n* Foundation Model Companies (50%): Based on comprehensive benchmarking data from [LiveBench.ai](http://LiveBench.ai), weighted by demonstrated capabilities across reasoning, coding, mathematics, data analysis, language, and instruction following:\n\n[Foundation Model Weighting](https://preview.redd.it/qs43dkgc7lxd1.png?width=2900&format=png&auto=webp&s=04ed97a4b7e9f0111f944633fbf12f3ea9995ea7)\n\n   1. Google (Gemini-1.5-Pro): 11.77% \n   2. Microsoft (OpenAI Partnership): 10.66% \n   3. Amazon/Google (Anthropic Investment): 9.79%\n   4. Meta (LLaMA): 9.49% \n   5. Tesla (xAI): 8.30% \n* Datacenter Infrastructure (42%): Weighted according to typical datacenter capital expenditure breakdown:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u14rf0vi7lxd1.jpg?width=1126&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=de34b7cdd3d81b7e017b0a06eed7a6102f8c2ddf\n\n   1. Servers/Compute: 31.47% Primary exposure through NVDA\n   2. Networking: 4.53% Split across CSCO, ANET, JNPR\n   3. Construction & Components: 5.99% Including:\n      * XLI ETF: Exposure to industrials that will be involved in building these datacenters\n* Energy Infrastructure (7.33%):\n   1. XLU ETF: Exposure to utilities that will power this buildout\n   2. This is based off datacenter variable (energy + colo) costs being approx 15% of the monthly cost of the datacenter, with the remaining being the capital costs of standing up the datacenter.\n\n  \n\n\n **An interesting catalyst for why I think now is the time to buy into this:**\n\nThere's going to be some foundation models that will be released over the next few months that will reconfirm the returns to scale for these models. [\\[1\\]](https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/24/24278999/openai-plans-orion-ai-model-release-december)[\\[2\\] ](https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/25/24279600/google-next-gemini-ai-model-openai-december) The truly exciting thing is that these models will be able to take actions to do tasks on your computer. The main issue in the current iteration of models is that they are not reliably able to do long running goal oriented tasks, but the release of o1 changed my perspective on this problem. That model has been trained to go through chain-of-thought steps to get to the right answer, and its data will be used to train larger models on the entire reasoning sequence. This unlocks a whole bunch of learnable training data. Things are going to get even more exciting.   \nI've been working on language models since GPT-1/BERT/etc, and the main thing is that every time a model comes out, we're all surprised at how much better it gets. I've learned to not be as skeptical of the returns to scale, and I'm finally putting (more) of my money where my mouth is. ",

    "selftext": "Hello Everyone,\n\nTrading is a journey filled with **wins and losses**\u2014it\u2019s all part of the game. Someone recently asked me how I protect my capital on the downside, and if my **\u201cdirectional gambling addiction\u201d** always pays off. Well, let\u2019s be honest: If there were a secure, foolproof way to bet on the market, we wouldn\u2019t be sitting here doing this, right? I'd probably be **hiking somewhere in Wengen or Interlaken, Switzerland**, enjoying the view.\n\nFor those of you who don\u2019t know me, let me introduce myself briefly. I\u2019m **not a financial advisor**\u2014far from it. I\u2019m a **brain tumor survivor**, and trading equities has become both my **passion and hobby**. Any gains I make, I donate to my **non-profit organization**.\n\nNow, let\u2019s dive into my next analysis on the upcoming **META earnings report**. Will this be the moment where **Zuckerberg-a-ta** grins with joy\u2014or not? Here's my take.\n\n# Trend and Channel Analysis:\n\n* **Ascending Channel**: META is currently trading within a well-defined **upward channel**, indicating a strong **bullish trend** over the past few months. The stock has been consistently making **higher highs and higher lows**.\n   * **Upper resistance**: Around **$600\u2013605** (near the top of the channel). The stock recently hit **$602.95** before pulling back slightly.\n   * **Lower support**: The lower boundary of the channel is currently near **$540\u2013550**. This suggests that if the stock sees any pullback, it could find support at those levels.\n\n# Moving Averages:\n\n* **8-day EMA (Exponential Moving Average)**: Currently at **$581.16**, META's price is slightly below this level at **$573.25**. This suggests the short-term trend might have weakened temporarily, but not broken.\n* **21-day EMA**: This moving average provides stronger support around **$573.29**. The price is **hovering close to this EMA**, meaning that a rebound from here would signal continued bullish momentum.\n* **200-day SMA**: Sitting at **$496.64**, far below the current price, indicating that META is well above its long-term support and remains in a **strong uptrend**.\n\n# Stochastic RSI (Momentum Indicator):\n\n* **Current level**: 23.79, which indicates **oversold conditions**. This suggests that the stock might be near a **reversal point**, with potential for an upward bounce if buyers step in soon. However, it\u2019s not yet confirmed, so the next few days will be crucial.\n\n# MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence):\n\n* The **MACD line** is still above the **signal line**, but the histogram shows signs of weakening momentum (declining green bars). This could indicate that bullish momentum is slowing, and there may be a period of **consolidation** or minor pullback unless strong earnings or catalysts boost the stock.\n\n# Key Levels to Watch:\n\n* **Support**:\n   * Short-term: $570 (near the 21-day EMA).\n   * Lower support: $540\u2013550 (bottom of the channel).\n* **Resistance**:\n   * Immediate resistance: $600\u2013605 (recent high).\n   * If META breaks above $605, it could lead to a strong **breakout** with the next target in the **$620+** range.\n\nWith earnings coming soon, the stock is likely to experience **volatility**. Given the current position within the ascending channel, the **risk/reward** looks balanced. A move above **$600** on positive earnings could extend the rally, but any disappointment might lead to a pullback to the **$550** level.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ihfrhwwxb7xd1.jpg?width=1534&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5975255afc9240c3f0b785113a57dd448507617f\n\n",

    "title": "Quick Stock Memo: Long GRND",
    "selftext": "**Analyst / Author Background:** Hi, this is my first ever post on Reddit / WSB. Pleasure to meet everyone. For background on myself, I'm a 35 year old male, worked in investment banking for one year and have been working in private equity for the last \\~15 years (middle market buyouts, growth equity, etc.). I am straight, however a close friend of mine who has been a user of GRND told me about the Company which led me to read up on the stock.\n\n**Revenue Model:** The Company primarily generates revenue through a freemium subscription model as well as targeted advertising.\n\n**Business / Product Overview:** GRND is a two-sided marketplace mobile app that provides social networking / social media solutions on a global basis to the LGBTQ community. Users primarily use the app for dating, or more so \"casual encounters\". Other than having a similar revenue model, GRND is fundamentally a different business from all other dating apps in that its users regularly use the app to find sexual partners. \n\n**Product / Service:** Users on average are on the app for 60+ minutes per day, compared to \\~10 minutes for Tinder and other dating apps. On average, GRND users spend 7-10 hours per month on the app. This significant difference in engagement highlights how the GRND product is different from all other dating apps, and therefore a \"stickier\" solution (price inelasticity of males looking for sex) and a more loyal userbase (GRND is already the de factor gay app and due to its scale, there is no reason for new LGBT individuals do go on any other app due to the number of users - this is the beauty of a two-sided marketplace at scale). Also, the velocity of engagement is reoccurring - while other dating apps have embedded user churn (built to delete the app), gay men use the app with velocity, on a repeat basis, and rarely delete the app.\n\n**Capitalization / Ownership:** The Company has \\~3x EBITDA total debt, which is prudent for this type of business. The Company was previously Chinese-owned, IPOd via SPAC, and subsequently acquired by a small consortium led by George Raymond Zage III, a former hedge fund manager, who now privately owns \\~45% of the Company. Balance is owned by individuals, employees, hedge funds / asset managers, etc.\n\n**Financials:** The Company is expecting $332M Revenue with $141M EBITDA for FYE 12-24. The Company has grown top-line Revenue more than 30% YoY for the last 5+ years and Gross Margin steadily increasing from 70% in 2020 to 74% in 2024E. \n\n**Market Segmentation:** The LGBTQ segment of the market is the fastest growing segment of the population. Serves the LGBTQ market, which as a portion of the total population has doubled in the last decade. In 2023, 9.8% of Millennials identified at LGBTQ, while 22.3% of Gen Z identify at LGBTQ. With each younger generation, a larger mix of the population identifies as LGBTQ- as these cohorts graduate high school, college etc., this will rapidly accelerate GRND's already rapid user growth. I imagine their CAC / LTV is attractive and getting even better as they scale (all growth word of mouth).  \n\n**Valuation:** Currently trading at \\~7x 2024E Revenue and \\~18x 2024E EBITDA.\n\n**Competition / Misunderstood Asset:** GRND has zero viable competition. GRND is incorrectly categorized as a dating app. Why should GRND not be viewed as a participant in the highly competitive / saturated and commoditized dating app market? The user engagement (GRND is 6x compared to any other dating app) tells us that it is a different service being offered than that of Tinder, Bumble, Hinge, etc. The value prop of GRND is sex, which gays care about, and there is no other app with the scale / number of men as GRND. The business should be looked at as part (1) two-sided marketplace (uber/lyft, etc.), (2) part dating app, and (3) part social media site (FB/Meta). The rest of the dating app landscape is purely swipe left/right commoditized tech and many offerings in the market therefore no pricing power.\n\n**Quick Model:** Assuming consistent but decelerating growth over the next five years (22.5% YoY), current leverage (3x), margin trend in line with historical, same O/S shares, etc. gets you a 5-year stock price target of $34 dollars/share, 165% upside from current level and \\~22% annual IRR. This is a conservative case given market trends, accelerating growth, competitive dynamics, etc. Also, I'm sure if you did a run-off DCF with what I believe to be very good retention metrics for this business, a DCF would indicate it is materially undervalued.\n\n**Summary / Thesis:** For gays looking for casual encounters / sex, not only is GRND the best place to go, it is the only place to go. GRND has no alternatives, whereas the swipe left/right dating tech is antiquated / a commodity / no barriers. GRND's value proposition is sex (gays are more open/less traditional), whereas tinder/bumble/match/hinge's value proposition is a drinks/dinner date. We will see accelerated growth in the coming years as the total LGBTQ population rapidly expands driving an acceleration of user growth, powering continued strength of value proposition (more men to choose from) coupled with a significant lack of viable alternatives (gay social media app at scale / with millions of users). The market / Wall Street Analysts have been slow to appreciate the asset (dating apps are a troubled, commoditized category, and it was a neglected security because it is the offspring of a SPAC). Wall Street Analysts over the next year or two are likely to initiate coverage of the stock (only two large banks cover it currently). \n\nNOTE: I wrote this up in \\~20min, so please forgive any typos, etc. Let me know any questions.\n\n\n\n   ",

    "selftext": "Elon Musk's net worth is estimated to have grown by tens of billions of dollars on Thursday, when Tesla ( TSLA ) shares hit their highest price ever. With Friday's trading volatility, his wealth is expected to increase even further.\n\nOn Thursday, Tesla reported mixed earnings, but the results were encouraging, with investors focusing on several factors including strong margins, earnings per share, net income, and the company's lowest-ever cost per item sold. This was Tesla's first earnings growth in seven quarters.\n\nMuch of this growth may also be attributed to Musk's new round of promises.\n\nHe predicted that Tesla will start offering carpooling in at least two states next year (California and Texas), where he plans to get approval from \u201cfully unsupervised\u201d Fully Self-Driving (FSD) regulators. Musk also revealed his \u201cbest guess\u201d for 2025 deliveries, which he said will increase by 20 to 30 percent, as Tesla plans to start selling more affordable models in early 2024. Tesla plans to sell more than 1.81 million electric vehicles in 2024.\n\nIn an earnings call with analysts, Musk said, \u201cI predict Tesla will be the most valuable company in the world, and probably by a long shot.\u201d\n\nMusk controls nearly 13 percent of Tesla's outstanding shares, but could buy more at a steep discount if his compensation plan is approved by the courts. He also owns a majority stake in SpaceX, which he leads, as well as artificial intelligence startup xAI and social media platform X (META) (formerly Twitter).\n\nTesla's gains on Thursday boosted Musk's net worth to about $270 billion, up $33.5 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. The index is updated at the close of the New York market. The Forbes Real-Time Billionaires Index is expected to grow by $26 billion on Thursday to about $269 billion. Musk's net worth increased by another $3 billion to nearly $273 billion as of Friday, Forbes reported.\n\nThe second-richest person on the list is Oracle Corporation ( ORCL ) founder and Musk ally Larry Ellison, with a net worth of $213.8 billion, according to Forbes. He was followed by Amazon (AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, with $207.7 billion and $200.5 billion, respectively.\n\nTesla shares were up more than 2 percent in regular trading Friday morning at about $266 a share, up 55 percent in the past six months. The stock is up just 6 percent so far this year.",

    "selftext": "\nTL;DR - Dad got cancer - so I went ham on investing \n\nI've been a long time lurker of this sub (and I never really post on reddit in general), but I didn't know where else to post this. I don't do options so maybe this is the wrong place lmao.\n\nI moved back home to my parents place when my dad was diagnosed with terminal brain cancer. Truthfully this has been the worst year of my life (and his obviously) in a lot of ways, but I've been investing since I was 16 (I'm 25 now). My dad worked in equities, so when he lost his ability to communicate effectively with me (and since I had significantly more income because I'm not paying rent) - I truthfully went ballistic on investing.\n\nPretty much said fuck it, I'm living at home I don't need a 6 month emergency fund till I move out and went all-in. Granted 40% of my portfolio not listed here is in a 401k account entirely in the S&P 500 (set & forget just in case my equities went to hell as with the rest of my life lol).\n\nI believe in the margin of safety when investing. I like to invest in high-quality companies that generate lots of cash as the backbone of my portfolio. Since 2021 (before my dad got this cancer shit), I spoke with him and he basically said just look at the fundamentals of a company and invest in growth companies that you think will be around in 5-10 years. I look for value within growth stocks (i know paradoxical). Some of my icons in investing are David Tepper & Michael Burry. Again below is all my own experience and reflects **only** my own views and are not a recommendation of my company (corporate. disclaimer).\n\n* My portfolio is heavily weighted (85%) between several stocks: AAPL, META, MSFT, GOOGL (So fucking cheap r u kidding me sorry), NVDA, AMZN, AMD, CRM, COST, RIVN (RIP), AVGO, VOO (ik not a stock) <-- I know semi(s) are very cyclical but i believe in holding all of these companies for 5-10 years, so I don't have to worry about temp. earnings beats/misses etc. Much easier to pick a stock and hold it for a while then it is to get the timing right. Roughly at 175% return in the past 3 years. (hammered META at $100's, NVDA at $200 both in 2022)\n* Roughly 15% of my bets are moonshots (note the word bet hehe) with promise but objectively could be overvalued/bad investments: CCL/RCL (both are crushing it and between them own 75% of the cruise line market), LCID/RIVN (going to 0 bc they can't scale profitably or will make u a very happy person 3 years down the line bc R2/Atlas at 45k/50k should capture a significant portion of model y demand), TTD, DKNG/FLUT - gambling hasn't even been legalized in Cali/Texas (the biggest markets in the U.S. come on), RBLX (feels like betting against youtube in the early innings w/o realizing how much rev. they're actually recognizing), PYPL (value - cheap af (bought at $60) should turn around in a couple years)\n\nI joke I allocate like google's budget where it's 90% bread&butter and the rest are moonshots.\n\nWas very depressed (still reasonably depressed) because I'm not sure how much time my dad has. I hope in a way I can pass some of these stocks to my kid in a better place than I found it. I don't know I'm crying as I write this. Fuck my life. It is what it is. \n\nCheers\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j8ym4lkamdvd1.png?width=1198&format=png&auto=webp&s=70c707919d6301944c8ff8cbbcb33ed03c9e6837",

    "selftext": "Hi all,\n\nI think that AI and esp. Semiconductor Stocks have a couple of strong weeks ahead. Starting on Tuesday, October 15th 2024, the [Open Compute Project (OCP) global summit](https://www.opencompute.org/summit/global-summit) takes place in San Jose, California. Between 9 AM and 11:30 AM there'll be short keynotes (each 12 mins) presented by Meta, NVidia, AI Clusters, Intel, AMD, Microsoft and Google (full schedule [here](https://2024ocpglobal.fnvirtual.app/a/schedule/#)). Now, I don't think that there'll be any big surprises. But the Summit still presents an opportunity for public remarks about how strong the demand is or what so ever. Also, there's an [article ](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/broadcom-inc-avgo-showcase-cutting-104612051.html?guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly9maW5hbmNlLnlhaG9vLmNvbS9xdW90ZS9BVkdPLz9fZ3VjX2NvbnNlbnRfc2tpcD0xNzI4ODU0NDU2&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAKqTmr_oqY7_RMid-YuYH-NWHYEacoobdBjWziLlvZPiA7iILBRd-lo7X9KXAZjgy5w-h3UleFvekLyyq8_xnp6qPaiSm_Zcbts2F5zfEtE-6faSgzbLuTu-_jZFaA5wXE26LZR81IYJnp9F3qqNZ_r7RkXaZ8GLTsvPT3HSz-1B&_guc_consent_skip=1728854471)that says that Broadcom (AVGO) is going to show case cutting-edge AI infrastructure.\n\nFurther it is expected that Taiwan Semiconductor Company (TSM) and ASML Holding (ASML) will publish their Q3 earnings next week. TSM will present its earnings on [October 17th 2024 at 14:00 Taiwan time / 02:00 Eastern Time](https://investor.tsmc.com/english/quarterly-results/2024/q3). So pre-market movements will most likely be wild on Thursday as a large part of the industry relies on TSM.\n\nIf TSM reports a great Q3 revenue, this could push Nvidia over the current all time high. Also according to Moore's law is dead, the first RTX 5000 series GPUs are ready to be sold, but are not released because of business reasons ([here ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZmki-4xaWE)at 22:22). So they could still change their mind and ship in Q4.\n\nNext, it is [rumored (by moore's law is dead) ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbEPwJvtA5M)that AMD will release a new CPU by the end of October or early November, the 9800X3D which is an 8 Core Gaming CPU with 3D cache and it is expected that it will be the fastest gaming CPU releasing this year. Although Client is not as important for AMD, it will still be beneficial to have this CPU released before the holiday season. Especially since Zen5 Rysen has so far been viewed as rather disappointing. Moore's law is dead also mentions an RX 7650 GRE GPU, which could launch alongside Ryzen 9800X3D. Releasing a slightly refreshed and cheap RDNA3 GPU could be a good move by AMD to get rid of RDNA3 stock ahead of the RDNA4 launch in 2025. Since the Ryzen 9800X3D has not yet been anounced, I don't think that it has been priced in and could give the stock a slight boost to recover from the -4% last Thursday.\n\nAlso, I although Investors were not excited about AMDs Advancing AI event, I think AMDs position in the market is still solid. According to the slides shown at the event, AMD Epic has increased its market share to 34%. And according to [tests ](https://www.techpowerup.com/327600/amd-epyc-turin-with-192-cores-and-384-threads-delivers-almost-40-higher-performance-than-intel-xeon-6)AMD Epyc Turin obliterates Xeon 6 Granite Rapids, while being cheaper. Because of this, I think AMD is in a good position to gain more server market share. Further, the news about [Nvidia Blackwell being sold out for the next 12 Months](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/nvidias-blackwell-gpus-sold-out-for-12-months/) is not only good news for Nvidia but also for AMD. Sure, everyone wants blackwell. but if one can't get blackwell and if AMD Instinct MI325X is faster than Nvidia Hopper (H200), then they might be able to win over customers from nvidia, who would like to buy blackwell but can't in due time.\n\nAlso, AMDs earnings should be reported on October 29 2024. Due to Ryzen Zen5 being disappointing and there being apparently a large RDNA3 stock remaining.\n\nIf AMDs Instinct systems are selling well, this would also be good news for Micron Industries (MU), which produces high bandwith memory (HBM3e).\n\nAnd then there's Intel. Their newest releases seem to have been disappointing. But they claim to be making progress with their foundries.\n\nSo I'm going Calls on Semiconductor Stocks (NVDA, AMD, MU, AVGO, TSM, ARM)\n\nThoughts or objections?",

Because a strangle is both selling a put on one side and selling a call on the other, you collect twice, and really obscene amounts to boot.  \n\nThis setup put me 70 dollars the put side and 80 on the call side (still pretty bullish at the time). This earned 18.45 per share, so I pocketed 9225.00 immediately.  30 day contract. Meta would have to take a real shit to lose 70-80 bucks  in a day or even two. On top of that, 15 days in while I\u2019m still comfortably just above the middle of the range, I can even opt to move my call further out and move my put a fair amount yielding MORE net credit yet while still hiding from loss near the middle of the range again.  \n\nUnless the stock market blows up in general, I find it hard to see how to lose, yet it makes a fortune.

    "selftext": "The Wire's article asks the question, \"[What is Jony Ive Really Building?](https://www.wired.com/story/jony-ive-iphone-of-ai/)\". But it's more complicated than it might appear. \n\nRecently, it was reported that [Apple is backing away from the upcoming investment round for OpenAI](https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/apple-drops-out-talks-join-openai-investment-round-wsj-says-2024-09-28/). There seems to be something afoot and Apple maybe completely caught off guard here. It's not just OpenAI and Jony Ive making a device. Mark Zuckerberg is proving that he wants no part of Apple's walled garden either via a recent release of a bunch of cool hardware that uses AI and no Apple influence whatsoever. And, Mark was more than happy to work with Xbox/Microsoft for future capabilities of the Oculus Meta Quest VR/AR headset. \n\nIf you're tracking, it's becoming clear that the top tier innovators that are building user products don't want Apple as a gatekeeper affecting profits, form, and function of what it is they can and cannot build. \n\nWhat is also damning is that Apple believes they can get away with not having to invest any real effort into AI with not only a late rollout but seemingly not very advanced AI capabilities via Apple Intelligence. So much so, they had to partner with OpenAI in order to provide a path for giving users an \"advanced\" model when it is something Siri can't handle. I don't even know what or how that is supposed to work well in practice but it is something both OpenAI and Apple thought was acceptable enough to do the deal in the first place. \n\nBut the lessons and traps here are historically available of what Apple always does when using third party capability for then themselves to take over and provide first party capabilities. Look no further than Apple maps. Eventually, they'll catch-up enough to not make the deal really worth it in the long run. But who knows, maybe it is beneficial for Apple and Google to exist this way. If you look at Android then the guess is, not really. In a way, it's a grand compromise. \n\nThe OS controls all and no matter what advancements in technology you have (Including Super Advanced AI/AGI/ASI) at the end of the day you are still susceptible to the delivery mechanism that technology is realized on; The OS or server providing API which is also on an OS but that's another topic.\n\nThe gatekeeping and filter nature of the OS is not be underestimated and many wish they didn't have to deal with it. For Apple users it provides a privacy comfort that many people appreciate. For aspiring startups and new tech is simply a pain in the ass. \n\nThis is where OpenAI, Jony Ive and Miss Jobs come in. Taking a lead from Zuckerberg they too want to build their own device that isn't bound by the restrictions and available capabilities that are provided by iOS. \n\nWhat's interesting here, very interesting, is that Steve Jobs wife and initial Apple innovation director Jony Ive are seemingly so done with Apple that they believe the time is not to go at it themselves. The game is set and the match is getting setup. Apple does not have enough AI IP to combat what is about to come to fruition with OpenAI's LLM dominance. Apple capex and massive stock buyback announced last quarter is an obvious reminder to anyone paying attention that they literally almost completely missed on AI. They even reported that they hadn't \"bought\" any Nvidia chips as if nobody would notice they also hadn't built anything great with AI either. Instead choosing to carefully craft using a third party IP to *fill-in-the-gap*s until they can really figure out what to do next. \n\nMake no mistake, Sam's sights are set on making a first party OS built on AI. No, it won't be the iPhone of AI but rather it will be an Operating System built on and for AI. This is something that Apple knows they will not be able to compete with as Siri has no proof or shown existence of being capable to even remotely compete with any of the large foundational LLM's from Google, Anthropic, Microsoft, or OpenAI. In this race they are last and eventually it is going to bite them. \n\nIt won't happen overnight but if anyone remembers blackberry it takes just one device to change the game. \n\nThe app store that OpenAI will provide will be one that can be of an AI Agent App Store that can function all capability semantically rather than through a touch screen. Want to order an Uber, just tell your agent to do it. Want to pay a bill, just tell your agent to do it. Want to call a restaurant and make reservations, just tell an agent to do it. Want to send that email to your boss in response to the email they sent earlier in the day, just tell an agent to do it. It's a world that doesn't exists on iOS and as of this moment, can't. \n\nI don't know how long this plays out and no hard details have been released yet but the pieces on the board are clear and they are in motion. Interesting times ahead. \n\nI have a position in Apple and will be watching this space closely. ",

    "selftext": "Here is my second attempt at posting. Rumble stock ownership breakdown: (1) Insiders 62% (2) Dan Bongino 10% (3) Institutions 23%. That comes out to 95% ownership 1,2 and 3. How is it possible that 14 million shares are currently held short and listed as 16% of the float? The math here isn't adding up. Until I realized that the outstanding shares used to calculate float also includes warrants (i.e. call options) that were issued when Rumble went SPAC/IPO that have strike prices of $10 and $17. Given that the stock is currently trading at $5.27, it makes no sense that the warrants should also be calculated in the float size. Anyways, it is clear that there is some funny business (naked shorting a definite) going on here.\n\nAs for the business, Rumble web traffic is up nearly 40% year over year and the share price hasn't reflected this bump at all. Also, this is only year 1 that Rumble started monetizing its platform with ads (started in 2024) and also launched a cloud service (started in April). In year 1, they are already on pace to have $100 million in revenue. That's pretty insane for any business.\u00a0\n\nFor comparison, Redditt has a market cap of $10 billion with a similar small (compared to other platforms like Meta, etc) but very devoted user base like Rumble. I don't see why Rumble couldn't 2-3x its market cap with such a high growth rate and monetization has only just started. For instance, their cloud business has already landed two big names in Hard Rock Hotel and Miami Dolphins only a few months after launching the service.\n\nThoughts: Given the strange math in the share ownership (likely heavily naked short) and rapidly growing business. I think this is a great risk to reward play. Not to mention that IF Trump were to win, the stock could easily double in a few days. The stock price moves almost in tandem with the election odds for Trump. I'm not going to make a guess at who wins, but it's a 50/50 at this point and the short term upside is huge.\u00a0",

You might think the rumor is \"its gonna be 50bps\". But rumors have layers. And that is just a micro-rumor on the meta-rumor. For how many goddamn months have we been hearing the goddamn rumors about will they or won't they....get us off this plateau and lower interest rates. The rumor has been \"they will lower interest rates\"\n\nThe \"news\" in the saying refers to the moment that rumor becomes fact. When it becomes history. Old news. Tomorrow is that day. The cherry will have been popped.  Tomorrow will be the peak of the collective interest in interest rates. It will be front-page news. It will be the Super Bowl for gambling degenerates around the world. People will explain it to their children, and remember it like they remembered 9/11\n\nAnd after the joyous rapture of finally reaching this climax, then \n\nTHANK FUCKING GOD we can finally all get on with our fucking lives and get back to our regular programming.  \n\n\n[Live it up, finance nerds](https://preview.redd.it/cpv2rs1ggipd1.png?width=1904&format=png&auto=webp&s=19c4077a836b436366a320f70f775625debdffa9)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE SINGULARITY HAS BEGUN\n\n  \n\n\n  \nI'm not sure if you're paying any fucking attention to what nerds are building these days. Let's look at a few examples: \n\n- To start, Waymo has solved self-driving. Tesla is on the cusp of doing the same\n\n- Tesla and like 5 other companies are about to come out with actual fucking cyborgs. Robot slaves are almost here. Be sure to treat yours nicely. \n\n- People are already falling in love with chatbots (imagine cyborgs v2?)\n\n- TSMC and Nvidia turn literal sand into rocks that can teach themselves anything \n\n- People want these magic rocks so bad that nuclear power has been resurrected from the dead so we can use the hot rocks to power the smart rocks\n\n- Oh and OpenAI just dropped their new model o1, creating yet another way to turn more GPU cycles into more intelligence. Except this time, the algorithm is less efficient. A \\*linear\\* improvement with \\*exponential\\* increase in GPU/energy. Meaning demand for GPUs just ...shot up... again (sounds crazy, but I see at least a doubling here). Nvidia isn't the only beneficiary here, but I expect that capture 90% of this newly discovered demand (more on this in another post)\n\n[$200 before the gopher sees his shadow](https://preview.redd.it/o5trxpcnhipd1.png?width=828&format=png&auto=webp&s=3c6a067248a3b70438c6db77c81fa12e92603341)\n\n\n\n\n\nPOWELL IS A GENIUS\n\n  \n\n\nOn to the main story of the day - what is Mr Pow-Pow gonna do? \n\nHe's smart enough to understand that the stickiest part about inflation is housing. And no amount of low rates will ever solve housing. We can't choose to spend less on housing. Millenials and zoomers are fucking crammed in together. Housing has a supply issue. Not enough of it. And how is that solved? Build more. What does that cost? Money.\n\n  \nAs paradoxical as it sounds, the solution to inflation has now become more money. We need construction to boom. Luckily, it is starting to. \n\nPowell also knows how to get a good price. How to \"stretch\" out his bps for the biggest societal changes.. Remember how skillfully he used the mere suggestion of rates drops to heat the economy up earlier this year. He got all that for 0 bps. \n\nSo how can he get the most bang for his buck here? Start out with a bang. All else equal, a 50 bps now will create a bigger \"push\" of excitement through society than would two 25 bps back to back. He knows this. He'd rather give you 50 pbs now than 75 bps over 3. That's strategy - focussing on the war not the battle. So he creates a giant sigh of relief. He'll give us more up front. A nice little surprise from Santa Clause\n\nThen the tapering will be slower than expected. That will get dialed back as the initial push shows to be effective. It'll be a classic Powell Tease. \n\n[HE'S BACK](https://preview.redd.it/0fl33yq1cipd1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=b2a7be47a5cf12cf2080edcbca884990130a774a)\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE GREAT ROTATION IS A MIRAGE\n\n\n\n\n\n  \nWe are entering an Age of Great Monopolies. Yes, the S&P500 is concentrated. But look around - globalization and rapidly changing high-tech have made economies of scale that are completely unbeatable. The richest people in the world have hundreds of billions of dollars. That is the new normal. \n\n  \nAre you really gonna drop Amazon...or Nvidia...just to scoop up companies that have higher debt, because now that debt is worth slightly less? You want banks ridden with corporate property debt and underwater T-bills? Amazon will have next hour delivery. Tesla is going to have i Robots. People are already falling in love with sex robots. \n\n  \nThe singularity is here. This is what it looks like. You may not like it but this is what peak acceleration looks like. That means you should be expecting exponential growth, and looking for companies going through it. Buy and hold or calls if you have too much money. \n\n\n\n[stay on left side to get rich ](https://preview.redd.it/50qpsmsxkipd1.png?width=1418&format=png&auto=webp&s=b81ee9459b6d60c8161553e5caef30f22b00d7ff)\n\n[expect more headlines like this](https://preview.redd.it/jv02xtkhiipd1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=cff31953fa88892218d6bd3a3f909d317f9ea68f)\n\n\n\n\n\n[I like the stock](https://preview.redd.it/10x1910lkipd1.jpg?width=1179&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e60c6940d8a88379e4bce4100ab4548812139371)\n\n",

I can't post link to the youtube video per subreddit rules. Below is a Claude summary of the video transcripts.\n\n## Amazon Stock Analysis - Main Thesis\n\n\u2022 **Current underperformance**: Amazon is the worst performing Mag 7 stock in 2025, up only 6% year-to-date while others like Google (+30%) and Meta (+26%) are crushing it\n\n\u2022 **AWS concerns**: Investors worried about Amazon Web Services growing only 17.5% vs Microsoft Azure (39%) and Google Cloud (32%)\n\n\u2022 **CEO misstep**: Andy Jassy's poor earnings call response failed to address investor concerns about slower AWS growth\n\n## Five Reasons Amazon Will Double (Go to $400)\n\n### 1. AWS Dominance & Diversification\n\u2022 AWS has $120 billion run rate, nearly as big as Azure and Google Cloud combined  \n\u2022 Over 4 million customers vs Microsoft's estimated 1 million  \n\u2022 More diversified customer base leads to consistent, compounded growth  \n\u2022 New Trainium chips and Anthropic AI partnership creating vertical integration\n\n### 2. Robotics & Automation Leadership  \n\u2022 Amazon employs 1.5 million people globally, with 700,000 in warehouses and delivery  \n\u2022 Already operating autonomous Zoox vehicles in Vegas with no driver  \n\u2022 Massive opportunity to automate repetitive tasks and reduce $60 billion annual labor costs  \n\u2022 Will follow Amazon's pattern: build for themselves first, then sell to others\n\n### 3. Prime Ecosystem & High Lifetime Value\n\u2022 Amazon Prime has become standard household membership with incredible value proposition  \n\u2022 Prime Video becoming major entertainment destination, rivaling Netflix  \n\u2022 Multiple benefits: delivery, entertainment, music, gaming, photos, exclusive deals  \n\u2022 High customer lifetime value with daily usage patterns\n\n### 4. Advertising Business Growth\n\u2022 Third largest advertiser globally behind Google and Meta  \n\u2022 Advertising revenue growing near 20% annually  \n\u2022 Retail advertising still early and underoptimized with high margins  \n\u2022 Expanding to Prime Video, Twitch, and even brokering ads for Netflix\n\n### 5. Logistics Network Scale\n\u2022 Built logistics network comparable to UPS, FedEx, and DoorDash combined  \n\u2022 Now offering fulfillment services to competitors like Walmart and Shopify  \n\u2022 Planning to launch in every major manufacturing location globally  \n\u2022 Scale creates further scale advantages in cost-effective logistics",

    "title": "The Future of RDDT Stock",
    "selftext": "Hi everyone, I wanted to open up some discussion on RDDT stock. I think a lot of people are investing for the wrong reasons, have it wrong, or are misguided about the company. I do have stock in RDDT so please take what I say with a grain of salt, but I will try to be fair. Also, I am not saying that I am all knowing. If anything, I hope for some good discussion and to be proven wrong.\n\n\n1. Data Licensing\n\nFirst of all, I believe the average retail investor is blowing out of proportion the impact of Data Licensing for RDDT. It obviously is good to have and is an investment positive in and of itself, but people overstate the revenue impact. In terms of last quarter, data licensing revenue was about 7% of overall revenue. This is obviously not an insignificant number, but the advertising revenue grew 81% YoY compared to data licensing\u2019s 24% growth rate.\n\nThis means that data licensing is becoming an even smaller portion of revenue over time, even though it is increasing on a nominal basis. Another thing about data licensing revenue is that RDDT said they had already entered a lot of large value contracts, and that the following ones would be economically smaller but more numerous in terms of the amount of contracts. They have a contract renewal with GOOG which is obviously great, but it is unlikely going to be anything that dramatically moves the needle. A positive about Data Licensing though is that it is pretty much straight profitability. Also, even though it might not be too huge of a revenue impact, it shows that RDDT will be cemented in the future age of AI and LLMs since you need the authentic human interaction.\n\n\n2. Advertising\n\nThis is where I am extremely bullish on RDDT. The unique user base, the highly relevant content and discussion, the targeted ads, the fact that RDDT users are more likely to go on this platform for product choices and purchase recommendations all contribute into what could be a booming advertising platform. There are a few caveats and things to consider, however. I want to start off with what could be a negative.\n\nUser growth is slowing. RDDT no longer has the new IPO hype wave and wave of news flowing around it, which could have caused a lot more user attention and growth. Daily Active Users in the US fell this past quarter and they have historically had an issue of converting passive logged-out users to active and intent logged-in users. This is something to watch out for. RDDT in the last earnings call Q&A stated that there were some hiccups with organic traffic from Google Search, and user growth increased by the end of the quarter, but still watch out.\n\nThis post is actually getting long as hell, so I don\u2019t want to go on too much longer, but I\u2019ll finish off with where I\u2019m most excited. The opportunity to increase the average revenue per user is immense. New product and dynamic ads, optimizing ad inventory, new ad types, and more are coming. Look into ARPU measures and that\u2019s what you can be excited about for RDDT. You don\u2019t even need user growth for RDDT to be able to increase revenue by multiples (partially joking but it is crazy how much monetization potential there is.) Obviously they will never be Meta, but as the platform gains strength they have a lot to gain.\n\nI am happy to include more based on everybody\u2019s reception, but I hope these points can start off a discussion about the future of the stock.\n\n\n",

If Sprout fails to manage costs effectively, particularly in areas like sales, marketing, and research and development, or if it cannot accelerate revenue growth, the path to full profitability may be delayed.\n\n\\- The declining market cap is a consequence of the lack of GAAP profitability and the slowdown in revenue growth over the past few months.\n\n\\- SBC: The company reports non-GAAP profits despite reporting GAAP losses due to a high amount. At least the SBC rate has remained stable: Q2/2025 reported SBC expenses of $20.2 million, which is almost unchanged from the prior year ($20.6 million). Additionally, SBC\u2019s total expenses for the first half of 2025 were just under $40 million, compared to $38.7 million in the prior year.\n\n**3) Opportunities**  \n\\- In the era of AI, data scale plays a crucial role. Sprout Social, for instance, connects to over 30 social networks and processes more than a billion messages daily. This vast data volume empowers AI to generate substantial value. Meta, X, YouTube, Reddit, and other platforms possess their own data. However, Sprout Social stands out as one of the few companies with cross-platform access. In my opinion, considering its current market capitalization, the market is significantly underestimating the potential of this data scale.\n\n\\- Social media is emerging as a lucrative growth channel for companies, prompting them to allocate increasingly larger budgets towards social media marketing. Recent surveys reveal that an impressive 80% of CMOs intend to shift their spending from traditional channels to social media, further emphasizing Sprout Social\u2019s strategic significance.\n\n\\- Product innovation: Sprout is investing significantly in new products, particularly AI and automation, which explains the absence of GAAP profits. In 2024, Sprout introduced numerous AI-powered features, such as automatic sentiment analysis and content recommendations. In August 2025, Sprout launched a suite of new integrations, including TikTok listening, Bluesky, and an expanded Salesforce integration, to provide real-time social intelligence to customers. These rapid innovation cycles enhance Sprout\u2019s competitive position and create customer value through efficiency gains and improved insights.\n\n**4) Why the turnaround is likely to happen now:**  \n\\- Sprout Social announced in an SEC filing dated August 26, 2025, that its CEO and board members will cease their automatic stock sales and transition to purchase plans. Starting in November 2025, there will be insider buying. Looking at similar cases from the past, changing automated sale plans to automated purchase plans often leads to a lift in the share price.\n\nExample 1, ticker ASAN:  \nChange from sale to purchase plans announced on March 8, 2025. From announcement to 5 days after insider buys began: +47.58% move.\n\nExample 2, ticker PLUG:  \nChange from sale to purchase plans announced on January 17, 2019. From announcement to 5 days after insider buys began: +85.71% move.\n\n\\- Sprout has been executing a strategic shift for several months. It\u2019s moving upmarket and, instead of monthly contracts, is increasingly focusing on annual and multi-year deals. This shift has been successful, as Prout has recently won larger customers, including Zoom, Honda, the U.S. Department of Transportation, NASCAR, and more. The number of large customers (>$50k in annual spend) has grown by +44% recently.\n\n\\- I anticipate a significant positive surprise in the upcoming quarterly report. Sprout has already hinted that many existing contracts are up for renewal in the second half of the year. This could potentially lead to a major positive surprise in the upcoming Q3 numbers, as Sprout is expected to acquire new (enterprise) customers and renew many existing contracts.\n\nWhat\u2019s do you guys think about Sprout Social?",

    "selftext": "I thought the $300b deal was BS when I first saw it. I now think it's real.\n\n1. OpenAI will likely IPO. Right now, they're worth $500b in private valuation based on their last funding round. I'm willing to bet that they can IPO for $1 trillion in valuation today based on pure AI ecstasy and raise a cool $100b - $200b in cash.\n\n2. The $300b deal starts in 2027 and runs 5 years. On average, it's $60b/year which is less than what other big AI players are spending now. Google is spending $75b in 2025. Amazon is spending $100b in 2025. Microsoft is spending $80b in 2025. Meta is spending $72b in 2025. The deal looks very reasonable from this perspective.\n\n3. OpenAI's revenue nearly 4x'ed this year to $13b. Let's say they can 3x in 2026, that's 29b. Let's say they can 2x in 2027 (deal starts here), that's $58b. This is assuming slowing growth. I can also easily see accelerating growth for a few more years.\n\n4. Deal with Oracle will likely be a ramp. Example: $30b in 2027. $60b in 2028. $100b in 2029. $150b in 2030. $160b in 2031. 5 years. It'll allow OpenAI to grow into it. Based on projected revenue, OpenAI will spend about ~50% of their 2027 revenue on payments to Oracle. \n\nMaybe everything will crash before this deal ever materializes. Maybe LLMs hit a dead end. Maybe you just hate everything AI. None of that matters. What matters is that OpenAI does have a decent chance of fulfilling the deal over a 5 year period starting in 2027 based on how things are going.\n\nPS. Why Oracle? Because Oracle is the only cloud company that is NOT trying to compete against Nvidia so they're likely getting favors from Nvidia. Meta, Google, Microsoft, AWS, and even Apple are all designing and making their own internal AI chips. Nvidia likely wants to make Oracle its main partner going forward.\n\ntldr; OpenAI IPO can easily raise $100b+, revenue growth projections can cover Oracle payments, it's less per year than what Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta are already paying in datacenter capex in 2025.",

    "selftext": "Mark Zuckerberg on Wednesday unveiled the $799 Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses, the social media company\u2019s first consumer-ready smart glasses with a built-in display.\n\nThe glasses, which costs $799, contain a small digital display that can be controlled via hand gestures through a wristband powered by neural technology, confirming a CNBC\u00a0report\u00a0in August. A promotional video of the new smart glasses\u00a0appeared\u00a0on Meta\u2019s YouTube page on Monday but was later removed.\n\nThe new smart glasses are a bridge between the company\u2019s audio-only Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses and the experimental\u00a0Orion augmented reality glasses\u00a0that the company revealed at last year\u2019s Connect event.\u00a0Orion\u00a0can overlay 3D visuals over a person\u2019s real-world field of view with the help of a wireless computing puck, but the glasses are expensive to make and not yet available to consumers.\n\nThe Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses come with the Meta Neural Band, an EMG wristband that allows users to control the device using hand gestures.\n\n\u201cThese are glasses with the classic style that you\u2019d expect from Ray-Ban, but they\u2019re the first AI glasses with a high resolution display and a fully weighted Meta neural band,\u201d Zuckerberg said.\n\nWith the new glasses, people can do tasks like watch videos through the display or see and respond to text messages, Zuckerberg said. The display doesn\u2019t block a person\u2019s view, and it disappears when not being used, he said.\n\nThe glasses go on sale in the U.S. on Sept. 30.\n\nThe company on Wednesday also debuted the Oakley Meta Vanguard smart glasses, intended for athletes who participate in high-intensity sports like snowboarding and mountain biking. The Oakley-branded glasses will cost $499 when they launch on Oct. 21, making it $100 more expensive than the Oakley Meta HSTN glasses that\u00a0went on sale\u00a0in June.\n\nThe Oakley Meta Vanguard smart glasses have a sportier look than the Oakley Meta HSTN glasses thanks to a wraparound design that extends its colorful lenses around a person\u2019s temples. Unlike the Oakley Meta HSTN glasses, the new model contains a button on the underside of its frames so that athletes who wear helmets can more easily capture photos and videos.\n\nThe new sports-centric smart glasses have up to nine hours of battery life, can capture 3K video and contain speakers that are louder than their predecessors. The glasses can connect with Garmin-branded fitness watches to track certain stats like their heart rates using the Meta AI assistant. Preorders start today.\n\nMeta also debuted the Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2), the latest version of the company\u2019s original smart glasses. The Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) costs $379, up from $299 for the version\u00a0released\u00a0in 2023. The Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) has double the battery life of the previous model, lasting 8 hours on a single charge, and a more powerful camera that can capture 3K Ultra HD video. The new glasses go on sale today.\n\nZuckerberg also announced Horizon TV, pitching it as a way to watch television shows, sporting events and movies using the company\u2019s Quest VR headsets. Some of Meta\u2019s partners who will be contributing content to the app include Disney and Universal Pictures, Zuckerberg said.\n\nSource: [https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/17/zuckerberg-799-meta-ray-ban-display-glasses.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/17/zuckerberg-799-meta-ray-ban-display-glasses.html)",

    "selftext": "The question has to be asked, who is funding OpenAI moving forward? \n\n$300 billion to Oracle. Projected cash burn through 2029 is $115 billion (as of a few days ago). And now this comes out:   OPENAI, NVIDIA TO ANNOUNCE BILLIONS IN UK DATA CENTER PROJECTS\n\nSo that lands them in the realm of needing maybe $500+ billion in the next 4 years? They don\u2019t make money, they burn money, so it\u2019s not coming out of pocket. Maybe they go public and aim for a 1 trillion starting valuation? I know there are changes with their MSFT deal happening right now, not sure if listing is on the table. Or is the US government just giving them a blank check? None of these options seem overly likely.\n\n$ wise none of this adds up, and it\u2019s really starting to look like a giant scam to me. Yes ai has great uses, yes it is not going anywhere. But it\u2019s also not profitable, at all. Not even close. All of the mega caps are burning huge amounts of money getting this all set up, with the plan to monetize it down the road. META had its panic moment when they started overpaying to poach talent, probably because they realized that llm\u2019s hit a wall that would result in ai not being as profitable as projected. \n\nI think we may be in the stage where all companies start lying about future capex and revenue streams. At this point they have to. Just look at NVDA, renting back its own products lol, clever, but not actually a good thing. \n\nIf the mega caps admit they need to scale back the ai roll out or drastically extend the timelines to complete these data center projects, then bye bye stock price. But it is hard for public companies to just straight up lie. OpenAI has less public eyeballs on their books. Can they really afford all of this? They are saying they can, and ORCL had an amazing day thanks to that. So maybe that is the play now. As the music gets closer to stopping, we will see more and more projects get announced from OpenAI and possibly some of the other non-publicly traded ai companies. \n\nThese lies buy the industry time, which will allow the publicly traded companies to do offerings, maybe sell some stock, and just generally prepare for the coming market downturn. In turn, they agree to support the companies that are helping them fake these expansion / future revenue numbers right now. Because when the ball drops, and the capex bonfire is still burning hot, it\u2019s going to get ugly. \n\nWhen will this finally fall apart? Who knows. Maybe 3 months. Maybe 1 year. Maybe 2 years if the government drops rates to zero and hands out blank checks to all ai companies. But it will hit, and it won\u2019t be pretty. The warning signs are already showing. ",

    "selftext": "Hello again!\n\nThree months ago I made a reddit thread about Investing in Escapism. I took my observations as a gen Z living in SEA and I had good discussions in the previous thread with people sharing their experience and what industries/stocks might benefit from escapism.\n\nMy initial bets were: Alibaba (BABA), Tencent (700), and Meta. They're all doing well and I even added RDDT into my portfolio due to that thread, it's up over 100% now (sadly I haven't bought much of it yet).\n\nI was still exploring into industries like BNPL which are really popular in poorer SEA countries (in Thailand where I live, the government warns that people are using BNPL to pay for food and groceries), and traveling (one redditor raised traveling as another thing to look out for, and from my observation it seems most Gen Z's seem to travel a lot, I see people taking a trip to Japan. I even plan one myself later this year). I ruled out Gaming and Alcoholism. (There was RBLX mentioned too, and it's been doing well this year)  \n  \nWhile I was thinking about Escapism, It hit me that I, too, am one of the target demographic. There is a raising trend about Gen Z who take their finances much more seriously than previous generations. Crypto, trading, stocks are becoming common words. I started investing back when I was 22-23, now I'm 28 and it's changed my life trajectory massively. There are probably many who are also doing this. a gen Z investor/customer will mean a lifetime of commission/fees if a service can make them stick long term.\n\nI'm not familiar with all the financial service or other non-stock space. My initial thought is obviously my broker: IBKR. I've been using their service since 2021 and I'm very happy with them. They have lower fees and global reach for both markets and clients. The financial knowledge in the US is likely the highest of the world, all the cheapest index funds and competitive brokerages are over there. I think the rest of the world will slowly catch up, which could mean positive outlook for IBKR who's positioned to benefit the most from the rise of retail investing (outside of maybe S&P 500 itself due to all the money flowing over there). Coinbase is another that comes to my mind but I haven't looked into it.\n\nI want to hear your thoughts. Which stocks or industries do you think will directly or indirectly benefit the most from the rise of retail investing? \n\nThank you again for reading!\n\n",

    "selftext": "Hi folks! I'm looking for some feedback and looking for some discussion around my current stock portfolio!\n\nI understand that most people don't out-perform the market (SP500, etc,.) over the long-term but I personally enjoy investing and want to generate some out-performance/alpha in my own individual portfolio in the long-term. In my retirement accounts (Roth IRA + 401k), I hold 100% SP500 index funds so these stocks are only held in my taxable individual account.\n\nI'm still learning a-lot and my investment philosophy is still evolving (most recently by consuming a lot of content by Warren Buffet, Charlie Munger, Chris Hohn, Dev Kantesaria, and Bill Ackman) so there's actually a good number of stocks here that I actually don't want to own anymore - but am looking at a more opportune time to sell them. \n\nMy current holdings are roughly (figures are rounded):\n\n**Amazon (AMZN) - 19%** \\- Have always liked AMZN as it's been a company with a diversified set of businesses with mostly good business models and are dominant in many of those areas. Particularly happy with the cloud business (AWS) and their ads business (from my understanding - they have an extremely strong moat and competitive advantage here they have so much data on customer's shopping habits).\n\n**ASML (ASML) - 15%** \\- Bought into this position mostly throughout the year by DCAing the dips. My view on this business is that they have a near monopoly in their space which gives them very strong pricing power (which they can leverage to increase their FCF/EPS/Net-Income even in the absence of revenue or volume growth). The stock seems to be beaten down due to risks from losing business in China (and also potential competition from them) but I'm not ***too concerned*** about this. In the worst case they become a global duopoly/oligopoly which is not too shabby.\n\n**Fidelity 500 Index Fund (FXAIX) - 11%** \\- Owned this when I initially started the portfolio.\n\n**Alphabet (GOOGL) - 10%** \\- Mostly bought into this throughout the dips in the past few years. Similar to Amazon, a very large set of diversified businesses where they're very dominant in like Youtube, Google Cloud (they compete with AWS, Azure, and OCI and they're third in the race and that's fine with me), Waymo, Ads, and Search. In the worst case, they lose their MOAT in search but from my understanding, the rest of their businesses can make up their current valuation in < 5 years. Anecdotally speaking as a developer, I still use Google search since they added AI overview since it's essentially a combination of an LLM answer + google search together. \n\n**Meta Platforms (META) - 7.5%** \\- The core of my position was from 2022 dips. They're just a cash generating machine from their balance sheet and they have a strong moat in the social media space. Not much to say about this since I bought this at around $120 - but happy to own this since Zucc is so ambitious and has done a good job at growing since IPO.\n\n**Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) - 6% -** Bought most of this position back in 2024 when it was in the $110/$120 range. Not much personally to say about this, I like the CEO and think there can be multiple winners in the GPU space.\n\n**Mastercard (MA) - 6% -** They take money off of every card transaction and have a oligopoly. Card payments are still growing globally so I'm just happy to own this. Financials look amazing! \n\n**Paypal (PYPL) - 5%** \\- I mostly bought this because it was very undervalued from a technical standpoint (i.e very high FCF yield). While their FCF/share is going to drastically increase due to their aggressive buybacks - I really do want to sell this entire position since they fundamentally aren't a business with a strong moat and pricing power. The space seems very crowded and in my own personal shopping experience - I almost always use Apple Pay when shopping on mobile and use Shop pay when purchasing online. Looking for a more opportune time to sell it though.\n\n**Canadian Pacific (CP) - 4.5%** \\- I bought this mostly due to railroads having very high barriers to entry and typically having strong moat (they have the only railway spanning USA, Canada and Mexico). This hasn't really translated to much FCF/EPS growth though and the company carries alot of debt. Looking to sell this position when it gets to a better valuation.\n\n**Fluence Energy (FLNC) - 4.3%** \\- I honestly bought into this purely based on technical analysis in 2024 - low market cap, very high revenue growth, large backlog, and enterprise backing. Currently down -55% on it and it\u2019s my only losing position. I really regret buying into this position and want to get rid of it, haven\u2019t had the stomach to just ear my losses and sell yet. Learned my lesson here to evaluate the business instead of the technicals.\n\n**Reddit (RDDT) - 3%** \\- I own this since this is a platform that I use a lot (in addition to Youtube). The financial growth seems very impressive and the business/platform is very good. I\u2019m debating on whether to buy more into it but valuation makes me slightly afraid, though it always seems like great businesses always trade at high valuations and still end up compounding long germ.\n\n**Nebius Group (NBIS) - 2%** \\- Honestly just my gamble stock.\n\n**Remaining <1% are FICO, RIVN, and SNOW.**\n\n  \nCurious to know what everyone thinks and what their feedback is!\n",

    "selftext": "Nvidia\u00a0announced Monday that its latest robotics chip module, the Jetson AGX Thor, is now on sale for $3,499 as a developer kit.\n\nThe company calls the chip a \u201crobot brain.\u201d The first kits ship next month, Nvidia said last week, and the chips will allow customers to create robots.\n\nAfter a company uses the developer kit to prototype their robot, Nvidia will sell Thor T5000 modules that can be installed in production-ready robots. If a company needs more than 1,000 Thor chips, Nvidia will charge $2,999 per module.\n\nCEO Jensen Huang has said robotics is the company\u2019s largest growth opportunity\u00a0outside of artificial intelligence, which has led to the Nvidia\u2019s overall sales more than tripling in the past two years.\n\n\u201cWe do not build robots, we do not build cars, but we enable the whole industry with our infrastructure computers and the associated software,\u201d said Deepu Talla, Nvidia\u2019s vice president of robotics and edge AI, on a call with reporters Friday.\n\nThe Jetson Thor chips are based on a\u00a0Blackwell\u00a0graphics processor, which is Nvidia\u2019s current generation of technology used in its AI chips, as well as its chips for computer games.\n\nNvidia said that its Jetson Thor chips are 7.5 times faster than its previous generation. That allows them to run generative AI models, including large language models and visual models that can interpret the world around them, which is essential for humanoid robots, Nvidia said. The Jetson Thor chips are equipped with 128GB of memory, which is essential for big AI models.\n\nCompanies including Agility Robotics,\u00a0Amazon,\u00a0Meta\u00a0and Boston Dynamics are using its Jetson chips, Nvidia said. Nvidia has also\u00a0invested\u00a0in robotics companies such as Field AI.\n\nHowever, robotics remains a small business for Nvidia, accounting for about 1% of the company\u2019s total revenue, despite the fact that it has launched several new robot chips since 2014. But it\u2019s growing fast.\n\nNvidia recently combined its business units to group its automotive and robotics divisions into the same line item. That unit reported $567 million in quarterly sales in May, which represented a 72% increase on an annual basis.\n\nThe company said its Jetson Thor chips can be used for self-driving cars as well, especially from Chinese brands. Nvidia calls its car chips Drive AGX, and while they are similar to its robotics chips, they run an operating system called Drive OS that\u2019s been tuned for automotive purposes.\n\nSource: [https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/25/nvidias-thor-t5000-robot-brain-chip.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/25/nvidias-thor-t5000-robot-brain-chip.html)",

    "selftext": "https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/19/how-ai-zombie-deals-work-meta-google.html\n\n> Jeff Wang got a big promotion last month. There were lots of tears, but not the happy kind. The 39-year-old was unexpectedly named interim CEO of artificial intelligence coding startup Windsurf. The company had been in discussions with OpenAI about a potential acquisition that would have resulted in a handsome payday for many employees. But the talks fell apart and, on July 11, several founders and top researchers instead left to join Google as part of a $2.4 billion licensing deal.   As one of the highest-ranking executives remaining at Windsurf, Wang was elevated to the top job, at least for the time being. His first order of business, he told CNBC, was to break the news at a tense all-hands meeting at the startup\u2019s Silicon Valley headquarters. \u201cIt was a very, very challenging day,\u201d Wang said. \u201cPeople were crying. It was very, very emotional. I was spending half the time calming down people, because they have families and they got nothing.\u201d\n\n> Windsurf is part of a growing crop of AI startups whose founders and top researchers have been poached by megacaps like Meta, Google, Microsoft and Amazon through high-priced talent grabs that are helping the biggest companies skirt regulatory scrutiny. While the deals often produce big payouts for founders and AI leaders, they can leave investors, other employees and the remaining company in limbo. Samir Kumar, a general partner at Touring Capital, said that what\u2019s left is something resembling a zombie company. \u201cThere\u2019s a big question of what their future prospects are,\u201d Kumar said. \u201cFrankly, you hollowed out the organization.\u201d  The headline-grabbing deal came in June, when Meta rocked the tech industry by announcing a $14.3 billion investment in data labeling startup Scale AI. As part of the agreement, Meta took a 49% stake in the company, hired its CEO Alexandr Wang to lead a new superintelligence lab and said it would deepen the work it does with Scale. A month later, Scale cut 200 full-time employees, or 14% of its staff. Meta\u2019s investment had doubled Scale\u2019s valuation from $14 billion last year. But that number only exists on paper.\n\n> Microsoft used a similar playbook in March 2024, when it hired Inflection AI\u2019s co-founders and other staffers. Amazon has completed two such deals in the last year, nabbing the founders and top talent away from Adept in June 2024, and from Covariant two months later. Google inked a $2.7 billion licensing deal with Character.AI and hired its founders last August.\n\n> For Silicon Valley venture investors, long the lifeblood of risky tech startups, the system isn\u2019t functioning as intended. Companies that would otherwise be on the path to a potential initial public offering or lucrative acquisition are getting pulled apart, with the bulk of the cash ending up in the pockets of the founders and their leading engineers. \u201cThe money doesn\u2019t flow as straightforwardly as it would in just a pure M&A transaction,\u201d said Rob Toews, partner at Radical Ventures.",

One will focus on A.I. research; one on a potentially powerful A.I. called \u201csuperintelligence\u201d; another on products; and one on infrastructure such as data centers and other A.I. hardware, they said. The moves are aimed at better organizing Meta so it can develop A.I. products more quickly to compete with others, the people said.\n> \n> Some A.I. executives are expected to leave, the people said. **Meta is also looking at downsizing the A.I. division overall - which could include eliminating roles or moving employees to other parts of the company** - because it has grown to thousands of people in recent years, the people said. Discussions remain fluid and no final decisions have been made, they said.\n> \n> In what would be a shift from Meta using only its own technology to power its A.I. products, the company is also actively exploring using third-party artificial intelligence models to do so, the people said. That could include building on other \u201copen source\u201d A.I. models, which are freely available, or licensing \u201cclosed source\u201d models from other companies.\n> \n> The changes follow months of tumult and restructuring at Meta over its A.I. strategy. Mr. Zuckerberg, 41, is sparing no expense and is willing to upend his company to stay relevant in A.I. as the push to create the most advanced technology has boiled down to a few key players. How Meta will fare is being closely watched, as the A.I. race creates new winners and losers.\n> \n> Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s determination was evident in June after Meta struggled to advance its newest A.I. models. That month, the company announced a superintelligence lab dedicated to creating an A.I. more powerful than the human brain. Meta invested $14.3 billion in the start-up Scale AI and brought on Alexandr Wang, its chief executive, as its new chief A.I. officer. Meta also offered some nine-figure pay packages to hire researchers from rivals like OpenAI and Google, igniting a Silicon Valley poaching war.",

Revenue growth of 30% YoY, last quarterly results basically confirmed to me that they can manage the growth while keeping debt under control.

    "selftext": "Nextdoor is a hyperlocal social platform sitting at the intersection of community trust, local commerce, and utility. After years of underperformance, it\u2019s in the middle of a\u00a0*major product relaunch*\u00a0that\u2019s already driving better engagement and beating revenue estimates. With a market cap under $1B (\\~3\u00d7 revenue), there are multiple untapped monetization levers, and real strategic appeal to larger players (think Reddit, Facebook Marketplace, even Groupon style business lines). The turnaround is just beginning.\n\n# Quick snapshot\n\n* **Market cap:**\u00a0\\~$0.7\u20130.8B (smallcap, sub $1B).\n* **Recent Q2 2025 revenue:**\u00a0Nextdoor beat consensus (Q2 revenue \u2248$65M) and reported improving engagement metrics. Management relaunched the app in July 2025 (big redesign & product pivot).\n* **\u201cThe new Nextdoor\u201d**\u00a0(launched July 2025) focuses on Alerts, News, and Faves (AI recommendations + local publisher content), built to make Nextdoor\u00a0*useful daily*\u00a0rather than just a social feed.\n* **Revenue (approx):**\u00a0\\~$240\u2013250M (implied by recent results / public data). That puts current market cap at roughly \\~3x revenue (very rough math).\n\n# Bull case\n\n1. **Founder/leadership momentum.**\u00a0Nextdoor just rolled out \u201cthe new Nextdoor\u201d, a material redesign that emphasizes\u00a0*Alerts, News, and Faves*\u00a0(AI recommendations, safety alerts, local news integration). The company is explicitly trying to move from underused UGC feed to a utility-first hyperlocal product. Q2 2025 showed revenue above Street estimates and management reported user engagement gains. That\u2019s the classic early signal: product changes leading to higher engagement leading to more ad inventory and better local targeting. If the relaunch sustains engagement lifts, top line acceleration could follow.\n2. **Hyperlocal moat trust & utility.**\u00a0Facebook/Reddit are broad; Nextdoor owns neighborhood context (addresses/neighborhood boundaries, local public agencies, homeowners groups) and is integrating local news and authoritative alerts (police, utilities, weather). That makes it sticky for time sensitive local information, something Facebook Marketplace can\u2019t fully replicate in a trust/utility sense.\n3. **Multiple, under monetized local monetization levers.**\n   * **Local ads**\u00a0(SMBs, local chains, political/municipal buys).\n   * **For sale / classifieds & marketplace**\u00a0(native commerce, transaction take rates or promoted listings).\n   * **Public sector / emergency alert contracts**\u00a0(municipal subscriptions or paid integrations). The relaunch and better engagement can multiply ARPU without needing a full blown global ad sales machine. Q2 showed revenue growth and the company is still far from saturating local ad dollars.\n4. **Low current valuation implies big upside for execution.**\u00a0At \\~$0.7\u20130.8B market cap on \\~$240\u2013250M revenue, Nextdoor trades at low revenue multiples (\\~3x). If the product relaunch meaningfully improves revenue growth rate and margin profile, multiples could rerate toward higher comps (local ad / classifieds peers), giving sizable upside.\n5. **Strategic optionality / M&A interest is plausible.**\u00a0A hyperlocal network with community trust and data is interesting to players looking to fill local gaps: Reddit (community + local expansion), local classifieds / commerce players, or even retail/media acquirers. Being small cap makes it an easier acquisition target if the relaunch proves momentum. (I\u2019ll expand on Reddit below.)\n6. **Playbook borrowable from Groupon/local deals.**\u00a0Nextdoor already has \"for sale & free\" and local business relationships. Adding structured local offers, time-limited promos, or merchant subscriptions (Groupon style vouchers, merchant promos, or subscription local deals) is a relatively straightforward product and revenue lift. Groupon\u2019s continued local billings show the market still exists; Nextdoor could capture a portion by adding deals and integrating them into neighborhood flows and \u201cFaves\u201d recommendations.\n\n**Catalysts to watch (bull triggers):**\n\n* Sustained weekly/monthly active user growth and time on app after the relaunch.\n* ARPU increase in upcoming quarters (ads + local commerce monetization).\n* New paid partnerships with municipalities or publishers that create recurring revenue.\n\n# Why Reddit buying Nextdoor could make sense\n\n* **Why it\u2019s logical:**\u00a0Reddit wants to deepen \u201creal world\u201d community ties and monetize local advertiser demand; Nextdoor brings verified local neighborhoods, public safety integrations, and local ad inventory. Combining Reddit\u2019s community driven content and ad products with Nextdoor\u2019s local reach creates synergies: better local commerce, events, and localized Reddit communities with verified local utility.\n* **Why it might not happen:**\u00a0Reddit could easily build this themselves and one could argue that the subreddits already achieve the main functionality of Nextdoor without needing a seperate app or community.\n\n# Facebook Marketplace Comparison\n\n* Facebook Marketplace is massive and already accounts for huge listing volume and buyer traffic globally (hundreds of millions of users). Meta can bundle marketplace commerce and ad targeting more cheaply than a small competitor.\u00a0**But**\u00a0Marketplace is a horizontal player. Nextdoor\u2019s advantage is\u00a0*hyperlocal trust, neighborhood boundaries, and municipal/publisher relationships*. If Nextdoor nails utility (alerts, local news, verified neighbor recommendations, Faves), it retains defensibility even in the face of Facebook. Think: users who rely on the app for safety and local official alerts may prefer Nextdoor even if they sell on Marketplace.\n\n# How Nextdoor can easily incorporate Groupon like features\n\n* **Merchant dashboard + deals API:**\u00a0let local merchants create time limited promos, featured deals in neighborhood feeds, or \u201cwelcome offers\u201d for neighbors.\n* **Promoted merchant cards:**\u00a0place deals inside the \u201cFaves\u201d recommendation flow and local alerts.\n* **Local vouchers + merchant payout integration:**\u00a0low friction deals (digital coupons) with a small platform fee or merchant subscription. This is lowlift product work (existing forsale and business listings are already present); the value is in embedding offers where neighbors are already looking for recommendations (Faves) and in alerts. Groupon\u2019s Q2 shows local deal demand still exists; Nextdoor could capture a healthier margin by focusing on repeat neighborhood customers rather than mass discounting.\n\n# Valuation\n\n* Market cap \u2248\u00a0**$0.7\u20130.8B**\u00a0vs LTM revenue \u2248\u00a0**$240\u2013250M**\u00a0\u2192\u00a0**\\~3x revenue**. For a small-cap social with improving engagement and multiple monetization levers, that multiple is low compared to growth comps that trade at higher revenue multiples when showing reliable growth and margin expansion. If Nextdoor can shift growth profile to midteens revenue growth and improve margins via ad monetization & local commerce, multiple expansion plus faster top-line could easily produce doubled (or more) share value.\n\n# Bear case\n\n1. **History of low engagement & moderation headaches.**\u00a0Nextdoor has historically struggled with low daily active usage vs registered users and with content quality / moderation issues (which depress advertiser demand). If relaunch fails to fix these, advertisers may be slow to return.\n2. **Burn & structural losses / tight balance sheet.**\u00a0The company is still losing money (GAAP net losses and sizable stock comp / restructuring historically). If growth proves expensive or ad demand weakens, cash burn could force equity raises that dilute shareholders or constrain investment. Q2 numbers still showed negative adjusted EBITDA (though improved).\n3. **Big competitors with scale and marketplace traction.**\u00a0Meta\u2019s Facebook Marketplace has enormous user reach and listing depth; Meta can bundle marketplace commerce with ad targeting at scale. If Facebook decides to deepen local utility + community features, Nextdoor could be outgunned on commerce. Meta\u2019s massive audience and Marketplace stats show a very large TAM that\u2019s hard for a small player to defend against.\n4. **Execution risk on product overhaul.**\u00a0Relaunches often raise expectations. If adoption is slow, or if new features don\u2019t convert to monetizable usage (or create moderation/legal headaches), investors will punish the stock. The market is already skeptical (shares trade near multiyear lows).\n5. **Ad market cyclicality & macro risk.**\u00a0Local ad spend tends to be more cyclical. A broader ad slowdown or a recession could hit Nextdoor hard given its SMB exposure and lower ad pricing power.\n\n# Bottom line / recommendation\n\n* **Bullish case:**\u00a0Low current valuation, a major product relaunch with clear utility (alerts/local news/AI recommendations), early signs of engagement/revenue improvement, and many undermonetized local revenue levers (ads, local commerce, municipal partnerships). If the relaunch sustains engagement, upside is meaningful.\n* **Bearish case:**\u00a0Execution risk, historical moderation/engagement problems, ongoing losses and potential dilution, and big competitors (Meta\u2019s Marketplace) that can replicate commerce features.",

    "selftext": "I made money shorting RDDT after the first record high. Now I want to do it again but their earnings report is stupefying to me. How can they be pulling in that much dough from advertisers? I never even notice ads on here. I can't believe advertisers would pay a lot to RDDT in the apparent belief that redditors are going to turn into big time paying customers. (?)  \nCramer said \"amazing digital advertising business because it\u2019s basically the last bastion of the old school internet\"  WTF?  That makes no sense to me. What am I missing?\n\nEDIT:  To respond to some of the resultant conjecture below:   \n1 AI says \"*Reddit\u2019s dominant income source continues to be advertising\u2014ranging from* ***84% to nearly 98%****, depending on the period and granularity observed. Revenue from data licensing (i.e., \u201cselling data\u201d to AI firms) remains relatively minor, generally in the* ***low single-digit to low double-digit percent*** *range of total revenue.*\"  \n2 Its super high PE indicates high expectations -- PE is not proof of an eventual outcome. The dotcom bubble was riddled with high PEs.  \n3 This 'great company' as someone commented, and a great deal of its userbase constitute a cesspool. From a returned-CEO caught rigging interactions to \"communities\" openly flowing with hate for others, it can never provide paying advertisers the return they now think they're getting-- any more than NXDR did. It has the same web of fifedoms where humans inevitably run their community in variant and non contrubitive ways. Its Q424 news letter is full of unprovable and exaggerated puffery to keep the mirage (to advertisers) going; I'm calling BS on their DAUq tallies. This mirage can't last. META towers over RDDT because, though it has groups, META is user-centric and therefore localized fiefdoms can't trod on META users like they do in RDDT and NXDR. The truth always eventually comes out and so advertisers will some day learn this. If you want to argue this, take a look at Bytedance's TikTok and answer for yourself why it will never be publicly traded. \n\nThanks for the few who posted helpful responses. Some responses were predictable or simply wrong, and I provided links in more comments.\n\n",

    "selftext": "The MI350 is close enough to Nvidia's performance that AMD can finally charge something closer to a premium price. This chip is no longer just an affordable alternative - it's being used in real-world, mission-critical AI workloads. Most importantly, this is the \u201cearly inflection point\u201d in the changing competitive landscape you've been watching.\n\n\n\nRevenue and margin gains are real \n\nAt higher average selling prices, AMD has been able to grow significantly without having to dramatically increase volume. Even the relatively low volume of the MI350 ($25K) is likely to boost Q3 and Q4 results, especially considering that they will be compared to a period when China's exports were hit hard. Margins could also improve: shifting more of the GPU portfolio to higher-end SKUs will help close AMD's earnings gap with Nvidia and Broadcom - which still limits AMD's P/E ratio.\n\n\n\nThe market expects AMD's GPU revenue to be around $1.65 billion in the third quarter. If MI355X grows as expected in the second half of the year and prices move in line with expectations, AMD's revenue could be revised upward.\n\n\n\nMajor customers could be behind this move \n\nAMD wouldn't be pressing prices so aggressively unless major cloud service providers such as Meta ( META ) and Oracle ( ORCL ) were on board. There is growing evidence that these customers are no longer just interested in AMD's GPUs, but are actually actively deploying them. We saw early signs of this in our Q1 earnings call and earnings filings. Customers appear to be buying AMD's complete AI platform, including ROCm, system integration and long-term support.\n\n\n\nAMD vs. Nvidia: The Price Gap is Narrowing \n\nEven at $25K, the MI350 is less expensive than Nvidia's B200, making AMD an attractive choice for workloads such as inference, especially among enterprises and second-tier cloud service providers that can't justify Nvidia's pricing. This creates an optimal balance of \u201cvalue and performance,\u201d and AMD is helping to lead the way in certain market segments. This marks a significant shift in the competitive landscape.\n\n\n\nRisks remain, but the narrative is changing \n\nHeadwinds remain. China's export restrictions could result in a revenue reduction of \\~$800 million in the second half of 2025, and it is unclear if or when licenses will resume. mi355x needs to be released smoothly and continue the momentum of mi350 - any issues with the software or system will be closely watched. rocm is still lagging behind CUDA in developer adoption. Still lagging behind CUDA in terms of adoption, but improving: ROCm now offers day one support for LLaMA 4 and there are over 2 million models optimized for AMD GPUs on Hugging Face.\n\n\n\nOverall \n\nThis indicates a shift in AMD's strategy. It supports our broader view that the company is no longer confined to the role of low-cost alternative, but is moving towards leadership in AI computing. If these pricing trends continue - and especially if they trigger even a modest \u201cahead-of-the-curve\u201d cycle - the market may begin to reassess AMD as less of a traditional chipmaker and more of a AMD as less of a traditional chipmaker and more of a platform company. As these fundamentals strengthen, the technological breakthroughs we've seen from AMD, especially relative to NVIDIA, could begin to gain real staying power.",

    "selftext": "Okay guys, so Amazon is set to release its Q2 earnings after the market closes today with an analyst call at 5 pm. This is gonna be a big one. Did anyone catch META yesterday? Fuck. \n\nFor Amazon, analysts expect revenue around $162 billion (up 10%) and EPS between $1.32 and $1.33, with operating income projected at $16.7 to $16.87 billion. And during this sesh, the key areas to watch will include AWS growth (estimated at $30.77 billion, up 17%), AI investments (over $100 billion capex planned), and advertising revenue (up 17% to $14.99 billion). Considering the stock performance, it's up 5% year-to-date, with bullish analyst sentiments (e.g., UBS raised price target to $271), but some valuation concerns exist (GF Value at $189.47). External factors like tariffs and Prime Day success could influence outcomes, with potential for significant stock movement based on guidance. I know that people are going to be playing AMZN earnings so I wanted to do a little write up for /r/Stocks so you guys are well informed. And I'll even post what I plan on getting at the end. \n\n**Analyst Expectations and Financial Projections**\n\nAnalysts have provided a range of estimates for Amazon's Q2 performance, showing a lot of optimism. \n\nRevenue: Expected to be around $162 billion, with variations such as $162.1 billion and $162.19 billion, representing a 9.5% to 10% year-over-year increase.  \n\nEarnings Per Share (EPS): Forecasted at $1.32 to $1.33, up from $1.26 last year, with Amazon having beaten EPS estimates for nine consecutive quarters.  \n\nOperating Income: Projected between $16.7 billion and $16.87 billion, a 13.8% to 15% increase, with an operating margin expected at 10.6% (up from 9.9% last year).  \n\nThese projections suggest strong growth, and I honestly think Amazon can exceed these figures and provide robust forward guidance. Especially given its historical \"beat and raise\" pattern, which may not suffice in the current up cycle.\n\n**Key Business Segments and Growth Drivers**\n\nAmazon's diverse operations are expected to drive its Q2 results, with several segments highlighted as critical:  \n\n1) AWS (Amazon Web Services)  \n\nAWS remains a cornerstone of Amazon's profitability, with Q1 2025 revenue up 17% to $29.3 billion. For Q2, net sales are estimated at $30.77 billion, with growth of 17% excluding foreign exchange effects. However, operating margins are expected to drop to 35% due to significant investments in AI and infrastructure, part of a $100+ billion capex plan for 2025. This segment contributed 17% of revenue and 58% of operating income last year, making it a focal point for me.\n\n2) Advertising Revenue  \n\nAdvertising is another growth engine, with Q1 2025 revenue up 18%. For Q2, it's projected to rise 17% to $14.99 billion, reflecting increased monetization of Amazon's platform as more businesses leverage its advertising ecosystem.\n\n3) Prime Membership  \n\nPrime membership grew 9% year-over-year to 220 million globally, providing a stable revenue stream through subscription fees. This growth, driven by benefits like free shipping and streaming, is expected to continue supporting Amazon's financials.\n\n4) Operational Efficiency  \n\nAmazon has improved operational efficiency, reducing fulfillment costs and increasing delivery speeds, which should enhance margins. These efforts are part of a broader strategy to balance growth investments with profitability.\n\n5) Investments in AI and Other Areas  \n\nAmazon's commitment to AI is a major theme, with a $100+ billion capital expenditure plan for 2025, primarily focused on AWS and AI services. This includes developing proprietary chips like Trainium2 and partnering with Nvidia to enhance AI capabilities. While these investments may pressure short-term margins, they position Amazon for long-term growth in the expanding AI market. Additionally, Project Kuiper, a satellite initiative, is noted as an area of rising expense, alongside e-commerce and content/advertising investments.\n\n**Analyst sentiments are generally bullish**\n\nUBS raised its price target from $249 to $271, calling Amazon the \"most coiled\" Big Tech name, implying an 18% upside and highlighting extensive investments across e-commerce, AWS, content/advertising, and Kuiper. Other analysts, including Wedbush, William Blair, and Stifel, reiterated \"outperform\" or \"buy\" ratings, with an average price target of $252.66 (range: $195 to $305). \n\n**External Factors and Market Context**\n\nSeveral external factors could influence Amazon's earnings and stock reaction:  \n\nConsider the Tariffs. Earlier this year, tariff concerns, particularly on Chinese goods, weighed on the stock, but recovery followed eased U.S. tariffs. Analysts are parsing impacts on e-commerce, with Amazon benefiting from stockpiling ahead of potential tariff hikes.\n\nAlso, think about the Prime Day Success. Held in July, Prime Day's performance could lift revenue guidance for the September-ending quarter, providing a positive signal for us.  \n\nAnd finally, with any earnings post, we need to consider macroeconomic events such as inflation, interest rates, and consumer spending trends could affect retail sales, particularly in online stores and third-party seller revenue, expected to grow 6.5% to $58.99 billion and 7% to $38.74 billion, respectively.\n\n**Potential Catalysts**\n\nI'm expecting accelerating AWS growth, better-than-expected margins, new AI announcements, and strong Q3 guidance. UBS expects upward revisions to operating profit and free-cash-flow as revenue grows, potentially more dramatic than peers.  \n\n\n**Comparisons**\n\nMicrosoft's recent Q2 results, where cloud growth was a significant driver, boosts my confidence in Amazon's cloud business, with MSFT stock jumping 4.47% in after-hours trading. This really does show how important AWS performance will be, as Amazon faces a high bar following Microsoft's strong showing.\n\n**So what to do?**\n\nAmazon's Q2 earnings are poised to be a major event, with strong growth expected across key segments like AWS, advertising, and Prime, supported by significant AI investments. This will be a great opportunity to get a call spread. For those who don't know anything about option trading, you don't need to continue reading. But for those who do, I'll be buying the 8/1 245c (@ 2.67) and selling the 252.5c (@ 1.11). This means I can get the spread for $156, with a potential max gain of 4.8x if AMZN can go up about 7.8% with earnings. Considering the stock moves on average about \u00b18% with earnings, there's a good chance it'll go up 4-8% today. \n\nNext week tho, we have a ton more earnings so I think I'll be doing a post on PLTR and AMD.",

Should the rally stick on Thursday, Microsoft would join chipmaker\u00a0Nvidia, which hit $4 trillion for the first time earlier this month.\n\nMicrosoft reported 18% revenue growth, its fastest rate of expansion in over three years, driven by its Azure cloud computing business. Microsoft disclosed Azure revenue in dollars for the first time, and said sales from Azure and other cloud services exceeded $75 billion in fiscal 2025, up 34% from the prior year.\n\nAs of the close on Wednesday, Microsoft shares were up 22% for the year, topping the S&P 500\u2032s 8% gain. Microsoft hit a record close of $513.71 on July 25. The stock is above $553 in extended trading.\n\nNvidia and Microsoft, two of the biggest beneficiaries of the artificial intelligence boom, have zoomed past\u00a0Apple\u00a0on the market cap leaderboard. Apple is third at about $3.2 trillion, with its stock having fallen 17% this year as\u00a0investors worry\u00a0that the iPhone maker is getting left behind in AI.

    "selftext": "With the recent macro situation, this could have a knock-on effect on equities and risk assets:\n\nThis morning, the EURUSD fell to its lowest since early July and is currently hovering around 1.0800. That's not a small drop, and a few days ago we were near the top of 1.09.\n\nThere are probably a few reasons at the heart of this decline: \n\nUS economic data was too strong \n\nQ2 GDP was revised upwards to 2.8% (previously 2.3%).\n\nCore PCE (the Fed's most watched inflation indicator) was higher than expected.\n\nThese data strengthened the market's expectations that the Fed will \u201ckeep interest rates high for longer\u201d and made the dollar stronger.\n\nECB releases dovish signals \n\nEurozone inflation data showed some easing.\n\nGermany's latest PMI data is very weak, recession fears are rising again.\n\nSome ECB officials are starting to sound cautious, and the market expects that rate cuts could start in early 2026 (and there are even suggestions that they could be possible by the end of 2025).\n\nSafe-haven capital is pouring into the dollar \n\nGeopolitical situations are heating up (e.g. Ukraine, global trade tensions), allowing the dollar to attract a lot of capital as a safe-haven asset.\n\nMeanwhile, U.S. bond yields remain firm 10-year U.S. bonds are close to 4.3%.\n\nWhat does this mean for the markets?\n\nLarge tech stocks and those companies that are heavily influenced by the dollar (e.g., $AAPL, $MSFT, $META) could be under pressure, especially since a good portion of their revenue comes from Europe.\n\nMultinationals (e.g., $PG, $KO, $JNJ) could take a loss in Q3 earnings due to exchange rate losses.\n\nEurozone stocks (which can be followed via the $EZU or $FEZ ETFs) could be pressured by economic weakness, but a weak euro favors German exporters, such as automakers.\n\nDollar-denominated commodities (e.g., gold, crude oil) could come under pressure in the short term due to a stronger dollar, unless macro risks push up safe-haven demand, such as gold.\n\nMy take?\n\nShort-term weakness in the euro is justified, but the next thing to watch is whether US inflation continues to \u201cstick\u201d, and the Fed's attitude at its annual meeting in Jackson Hole at the end of August. If Powell is hawkish again, we could see EUR/USD fall to 1.07 or even 1.06.\n\nIs anyone hedging their exchange rate risk with forex manipulation, long DXY (dollar index) options, or in company earnings reports?

    "title": "Nvidia Will Continue Controlling The AI Board",
    "selftext": "Nvidia is the 'queen' of the AI ecosystem, dominating hardware, software, and systems and controlling key segments from training to inference and networking.\n\nUnmatched AI leadership, explosive revenue growth, and strategic partnerships with players like Astera Labs, Credo, and Super Micro Computer reinforce Nvidia's central role.\n\nChina market access and the Omniverse platform provide significant new growth drivers, supporting a strong 12-24 month growth outlook and a buy rating.\n\nDespite high absolute valuation multiples, Nvidia's rapid growth and favorable PEG ratios make it attractive versus peers; the main risk is US-China geopolitical tension.\n\nI believe these companies are well-positioned in the AI ecosystem, but I realise that one piece is missing: the queen. Just like in a game of chess, the queen is the most powerful and versatile piece on the board. It can move in any direction (horizontal, vertical, and diagonal) and quickly cover a wide area. That is why I believe it is a perfect fit for NVIDIA (NVDA). I say this because it dominates both offensively and defensively. Just as the queen controls most of the board, NVDA controls the most valuable parts of the AI infrastructure, from training to inference, simulation, and networking. Secondly, it is versatile and critical because it spans hardware, software, and systems. This is cool because few participants can match its breadth and influence. Finally, it leverages strategic partnerships. I mean, just as the queen commands pawns, rooks, and bishops, NVDA integrates system builders (such as Super Micro Computer (SMCI)), connectivity providers (such as Credo Technology Group (CRDO) and Astera Labs (ALAB)), and government AI programmes to expand its control over the AI battlefield.\n\nSo why is the queen so special?\n\nWell, several factors set Nvidia apart. First and foremost, it holds an unparalleled leadership position in the AI field, thanks to the combination of hardware, software, and ecosystem advantages. Its Blackwell GPU architecture makes it uniquely special. Combined with the Omniverse simulation platform, we are driving self-reinforcing AI, which is driving explosive growth. For example, in the first quarter of the 2026 fiscal year, NVDA achieved revenue of $44.1 billion, representing a year over year increase of 69%. Data centre revenue reached $39.1 billion, up 73%. Some of Nvidia's key customers such as Microsoft , Google  OpenAI, and Meta  deploy tens of thousands of Nvidia's latest GPUs each quarter. For example, according to SA Weebler Finance data, hyperscale data centre operators are running approximately 1,000 NVLink rack systems (about 72,000 GPUs) per week, with further increases expected. Ideally, this means Nvidia's data centre run rate in the AI computing sector has exceeded $170 billion annually.\n\nSecondly, NVDA's stack is also expanding beyond GPUs. As I mentioned, its global industrial simulation platform is now being used to digitise entire factories and cities. In fact, the platform has evolved to support critical infrastructure. Original equipment manufacturers like BMW are running over 30 virtual factories on the platform to optimise production in advance. As each AI solution requires an increasing amount of synthetic training data, NVDA's end-to-end solutions form an unparalleled moat. Ideally, this platform means more users generating more simulation data, ultimately driving demand for more Nvidia computing resources. What I see is that NVDA is now at the centre of the AI value chain.\n\nFinally, the U.S. has approved the resumption of exports of NVIDIA H20 AI GPUs to China. This means NVIDIA will be able to access China's potential market, which is significant. According to a Morgan Stanley report, China's AI market is expected to reach $1.4 trillion by 2030.\n\nChina has been systematically implementing a long-term strategy to build its domestic artificial intelligence capabilities. Its strong academic foundation, innovative methods, data, talent, and growing foreign investment are driving it toward becoming a leading artificial intelligence powerhouse...\n\n\u2018...China is less concerned with building the most powerful AI capabilities and more focused on bringing AI to market. China embraces open-source AI, while the United States appears to be moving toward closed, tightly controlled AI systems...\u2019\n\n\u2018...The next 6 to 12 months will be a critical period for Chinese AI companies, as more and more deployments aimed at solving real-world problems begin to demonstrate productivity gains.\u2019\n\nDue to this milestone, NVDA's Jensen Huang estimates that NVDA's potential market size  in China will reach $50 billion. This means that China's spending on AI will increase, and Nvidia's growth prospects are expected to be stronger than ever before. I expect this growth outlook to be reflected in the upcoming quarterly earnings report to be released on 27 August 2025.\n\nThese factors combined will undoubtedly accelerate Nvidia's growth trajectory over the next 12 to 24 months. Therefore, I assign a \u2018Buy\u2019 rating to Nvidia Corporation.\n\nNvidia's AI Ecosystem\n\nHaving highlighted the case for NVDA, I would like to connect it to some AI components I have researched previously. Some of these AI companies have remarkable growth prospects and are expected to align their growth trajectories with NVDA. Additionally, the connections between NVDA and these AI companies will help us better understand NVDA's future direction.\n\nFirst, Astera Labs  is a leading connectivity chip company that recently went public in 2024. ALAB's chips support scalable and low-latency GPU rack interconnects. For more information on Astera Labs and its chips, please refer to Article 1 and Article 2. Now, Nvidia has publicly announced its collaboration with Astera on NVLink Fusion. This collaboration expands NVDA's total addressable market (TAM).\n\nThere is also Credo Technology, which is known for its active cables  re-timers, and SerDes chips. According to SA Oakoff Investments, most hyperscale computing vendors now consider CRDO's AEC to be the de facto standard for in-rack links. This means that AEC cables are the infrastructure required for NVDA's 72-GPU Blackwell rack.\n\nThird, Super Micro Computer  and Celestica  manufacture and sell GPU racks and systems using NVDA technology. Nvidia currently provides complete data centre racks containing tens of thousands of GPUs, which are delivered to system builders like SMCI and CLS. They then collaborate with NVDA to package and sell these racks to hyperscale customers such as Microsoft, Meta, and Amazon. For more information, please refer to this article from SMCI and this article from Celestica.\n\nIn summary, these partnerships demonstrate NVIDIA's connectivity within the AI ecosystem. This confirms that NVIDIA is indeed the queen of the AI chessboard.\n\nFor a company with a market capitalisation of 4.22 trillion dollars, it still has significant growth opportunities, particularly in the Chinese market, which means there is much to watch for with NVIDIA. Additionally, I note that NVIDIA has an A- growth rating, as shown in the figure below. The company's expected revenue growth rate is 60.71%, while the industry median is 7.28%. Furthermore, its 3-5 year compound annual growth rate  for expected long-term earnings per share  growth is 29.09%, compared to the industry median of 14.29%. This clearly indicates the expected growth levels for certain potential AI opportunities, such as the Omniverse platform and the Chinese AI market.\n\nNow, when it comes to valuation, the growth outlook is becoming clearer. First, when I look at the chart below, I notice that most metrics are above the industry median, indicating that the valuation is higher than the industry median. Its non-GAAP forward price-to-earnings ratio is 40.12 times, and its forward enterprise value to EBITDA ratio is 34.79 times, both significantly higher than the industry median. However, when I look at the non-GAAP forward price-to-earnings ratio , it indicates that the valuation is undervalued by 27%. NVDA's price-to-earnings ratio is 1.38 times, while the industry median is 1.90 times. Based on the GAAP trailing 12-month PEG, the company's P/E ratio is 0.69 times, undervalued by 31% compared to the industry median. Ideally, I would say that most multiples look high in absolute terms, but compared to NVDA's 60.71% compound annual growth rate, the stock's valuation isn't as high as it appears.\n\nIn terms of peer comparison, I chose NVDA's closest competitors because Nvidia is already far ahead in terms of market capitalisation, so I chose Broadcom and AMD. I noticed that NVDA's price-to-earnings ratio and expected price-to-earnings ratio are still lower than its peers.\n\nI believe that the biggest risk facing NVIDIA at present is geopolitical risk. Currently, there are many uncertainties between China and the United States, especially following the imposition of tariffs on Liberation Day and the U.S. government's decision to suspend exports of H20 GPUs to China. Such situations could recur and undermine NVIDIA's growth plans and market expansion efforts. Losing the Chinese market would have a significant impact on NVIDIA's business. Additionally, geopolitical events such as trade tariffs and sanctions could affect global supply or cloud computing spending in some of the key regions where NVIDIA operates. In conclusion, in this grand AI infrastructure game, NVIDIA is the queen. Currently, it is the most powerful and flexible piece on the board. Compared to peers that may occupy other key positions, NVIDIA controls every direction. For example, AMD is the rook, SMCI is the bishop, while Credo and Astera are agile knights. Ultimately, NVIDIA determines the pace and scope of this game. As AI demand continues to grow, NVIDIA's dominant position is further strengthened by the expansion of the Chinese market.",

I mean at some point, doesn't everyone who wants an Iphone have an iPhone. And from there, growth becomes people upgrading and I feel that the incremental improvements will be smaller and smaller (as they have been) and the fraction of people with an iPhone upgrading will reduce. So there is not growth here in my view\n\n- what about vision pro? This is interesting, but the sticker shock is big here. Also, there are more competitors in this space now, including META which has been investing in this tech for some time now, and increasingly Google (see their recent I/O). I don't think the vision pro has the cool factor to offset the cost delta between it and others.\n\n- apple car, was this a thing? I think they bailed on this.\n\nI ultimately think that the pixel will eat up some iPhone customers as the AI features (again, see the Google I/O, it's early stage but it will only get better) will be hard to resist for a lot of consumers in my opinionas the tech matures. Even if apple teams with open AI, pixel phones will be more and more build around AI. Apple management have been clear that they see AI more adding \"nuanced\" features in their products, though it's not clear they have a path yet even to this.\n\nJust wanted to post my thoughts and open to being proven wrong and learning something.

The Oakley expansion will be done in partnership with Luxottica, while the addition of Prada signifies Meta\u2019s first step toward bring its wearable hardware to more fashion companies.\u00a0\n\nMeta on Monday teased the Oakley release on social media, launching an Instagram account for \u201cOakley | Meta\u201d with a profile description that reads \u201cThe next evolution is coming on June 20.\u201d\n\nCNBC reviewed a document that says the new glasses with Luxottica will be\u00a0aimed\u00a0at athletes. Meta is\u00a0targeting\u00a0active consumers after seeing several owners of its Ray-Ban glasses use the device to record themselves playing tennis, skiing and doing other activities.\n\nThe Oakley version of the glasses may cost around $360 as they are more weather resistant than their Ray-Ban counterparts, according to a person familiar with the matter who was not authorized to speak publicly about the upcoming device. The first version of the Oakley Meta glasses will feature similar technology to the Ray-Ban Meta glasses released in 2023.\n\nLuxottica, based in France and Italy, has licensing arrangements with over 150 brands and owns notable brands including Ray-Ban, Oakley, Vogue Eyewear and Persol.\n\nMeta\u2019s agreement with Prada comes after the fashion company in December renewed an eyewear-related\u00a0licensing agreement\u00a0with Luxottica for 10 years. That deals covers the \u201cdevelopment, production and worldwide distribution of eyewear under the Prada, Prada Linea Rossa and Miu Miu brands,\u201d the companies said at the time.\n\nBesides giving Meta a high-end partnership, the Prada glasses may be a particularly good fit for the tech company as many of the brand\u2019s models come with thick temples, former Meta employees said. That provides more heft for housing many of the components necessary for smart glasses, including microphones and chips.\n\nIt\u2019s\u00a0unclear when the Prada deal and product line will be announced.\n\nMeta first partnered with EssilorLuxottica in 2019 to jointly develop the Ray-Ban glasses. The two companies released the first version in 2021, but they found success after the release of the second-generation Ray-Ban Meta glasses in 2023. That version comes equipped with the Meta AI voice assistant and includes features and, when tethered to a smartphone, lets users identify city landmarks, get recipes when looking at ingredients and record and send voice messages on WhatsApp and Messenger.\n\nEssilorLuxottica CEO Francesco Milleri said in February the companies have sold 2 million pairs of the Meta Ray-Ban glasses since 2023. Miller said he aimed to increase annual production to 10 million units by the end of 2026.\n\nMeta and Luxottica\u00a0announced\u00a0an extension of their partnership in October, with plans to release more versions of their Ray-Ban glasses. That deal was worth $5 billion, according to\u00a0a July 2024 report\u00a0in The Wall Street Journal. As part of the deal, Meta gets exclusive rights to Luxottica\u2019s brands for its smart glasses technology for a number of years, a person familiar with the matter told CNBC.\u00a0\n\nThe two companies plan to release a bulkier, third generation of their glasses in time for the coming holiday season. The new device is expected to include a small display in one of the lenses, CNBC has previously reported.\n\nCompetition in the market is heating up.\n\nLast month,\u00a0Alphabet\u00a0announced\u00a0a $150 million partnership\u00a0with\u00a0Warby Parker\u00a0that will see the two companies team up to release glasses infused with Google\u2019s Gemini AI assistant. The companies plan to release the glasses sometime after 2025.\u00a0\n\nSnap, meanwhile, announced in June that it plans to release its sixth generation smart glasses under a new brand called Specs. Those glasses, expected for release in 2026, will include augmented-reality technology and will be smaller and lighter than Snap\u2019s prior products, Snap said.\u00a0\n\nMeta declined to comment. Luxottica and Prada could not be reached.\n\nBloomberg News first\u00a0reported\u00a0about the Oakley Meta glasses in January.\n\nSource: [https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/17/meta-oakley-prada-smart-glasses-luxottica.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/17/meta-oakley-prada-smart-glasses-luxottica.html)",

    "selftext": "Bloomberg) -- Meta Platforms Inc. will begin showing ads inside of its WhatsApp messaging service, opening a new potential revenue stream while the company invests heavily in artificial intelligence and other long-term projects. \n\nThe ads will appear in WhatsApp\u2019s \u201cUpdates\u201d tab, a section of the app that\u2019s separate from a user\u2019s inbox and private conversations. The tab gets 1.5 billion visitors per day, Meta said Monday. That tab is home to Status, WhatsApp\u2019s version of disappearing Stories, which will now carry ads.\n\nAdvertisers can also pay to promote their WhatsApp Channel and give it prominent placement within the Updates tab. Channels allow brands or celebrities to post to a group of followers, like a giant email blast. \n\nAs part of the advertising push, WhatsApp will also let Channel operators sell subscriptions, meaning they can create special messages just for a group of paying customers. Meta won\u2019t take a cut of any subscriptions sold through the app at launch, but eventually plans to charge 10% of sales, Alice Newton Rex, vice president of product at WhatsApp, said in an interview. \n\nMeta has been spending aggressively this year on AI, including to improve the large language models that underpin generative AI features in its products. The company also just agreed to invest $14.3 billion for a 49% stake in Scale AI, an AI data labeling startup, according to a person familiar with the deal. The expense has added pressure on Meta\u2019s main advertising business to continue growing to support the expanding AI effort. \n\nThe company has spent years slowly developing a business to accompany the private messaging service acquired for $19 billion in 2014. Advertising has never been considered a great fit given the intimacy of a private messaging inbox. Meta instead built WhatsApp to cater to small businesses, including efforts to build out digital payments and shopping features. Those services have been targeted especially in countries outside the US, such as India and Brazil, where the WhatsApp is the dominant messaging app. \n\nWhile payments, in particular, has been a slow moving effort given various regulatory concerns, Meta makes billions of dollars each year selling click-to-message ads on Instagram and Facebook that send users to a WhatsApp chat conversation with the advertiser. It also allows businesses to pay to reach customers on the app who have opted to receive their direct messages. \n\nPart of Meta\u2019s challenge historically has been balancing the desire to generate revenue with a desire to give WhatsApp users privacy. Meta\u2019s other advertising products are hyper-targeted and often rely on a user\u2019s personal information or browsing history. WhatsApp messages are end-to-end encrypted, and user privacy was a major promise from co-founders Jan Koum and Brian Acton, who pledged they would never sell ads inside WhatsApp. They left Meta in 2018 and 2017, respectively.\n\nWhatsApp ads will use broad, general targeting like a user\u2019s location, language preferences, and Channels that they follow, Newton Rex said. Meta won\u2019t take a person\u2019s Facebook or Instagram information to target them with ads on WhatsApp unless they\u2019ve explicitly linked their accounts, she added. \n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to interrupt people\u2019s personal messages with ads,\u201d Newton Rex said. \u201cIf you just want to carry on using WhatsApp for messaging and calling then you\u2019ll never see them at all.\u201d\n\nWhatsApp will begin a global rollout of ads beginning Monday, but it will take time for all users to start seeing them, she added.

Not an immediate trade worth looking at today, likely this will happen during OVERNIGHT or afterhours. \n\n[**CRCL (Circle)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=CRCL&p=d) \\- Set ATH after a recent explosive IPO. IPOs lately have been explosive. Already broke the $140 level, watching the $150 level next but unlikely to go extremely heavy in this even if we get up there.

The big C is already near ATH, so I'm interested in seeing if we're able to make a significant move today.",

AI-driven demand from hyperscalers and new sovereign deals (UAE, Saudi Arabia) provides long-term headroom for continued growth. Despite the loss of China revenues and recent price stagnation, NVIDIA's fundamentals remain strong and its market leadership unquestioned. I am upgrading my rating on NVDA stock to Strong Buy, believing it is capable of delivering superior returns and has the potential to reach a $10 trillion valuation.\n\n\n\nWhen I looked at NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA ) late last year, I thought the stock had a pretty good shot at 2025. While the stock has soared, the valuation has fallen because of strong earnings growth, thanks in large part to the seemingly never-ending demand for GPUs in exascale computing platforms. 2025 was destined to be the \u201cYear of Blackwell,\u201d and I expected the stock to continue to rise, albeit at a slower pace than in previous years.\n\nInstead, we saw the stock briefly try to break out to a new all-time high, or ATH, before reversing sharply and selling off. We know the various reasons for this reversal. On the one hand, the broader market sold off amid tariff uncertainty, and few companies were immune. the release of DeepSeek (DEEPSEEK) in early 2025 triggered a sort of flash panic, with some claiming that the boom time for high-end chips was over. The logic was that DeepSeek would be able to save costs and increase efficiency so dramatically that companies running AI reasoning could rely on much less powerful chips. I think the evidence so far is that this reasoning is completely wrong, and instead we're seeing the Jevons Paradox come true.\n\nIt was probably inevitable that NVIDIA would now lose essentially all of its China-related revenue. At a recent conference, CFO Colette Kress pretty much poured cold water on the company's prospects for generating further revenue in China.\n\nIn my opinion, NVIDIA is attractively valued. The two best performers this year among the Big 7 tech giants have been Microsoft and Meta. looking at how NVIDIA compares to these peers, I see a big gap between them at the moment. In terms of price-to-earnings ratio, NVIDIA's valuation sits right in the middle of the three, but in terms of return on invested capital and medium-term EPS projections, it's way ahead.",

I have a small position on Gravity (GRVY) but it has been performing quite disappointingly.\n\nI believe value added service/social media will be better pick since you make money off of ads and user content. in this regards, I think Tencent holds an incredible economic moat and is relatively well protected from tariffs compared to its peers. I also own LY Corp (4689) which operates Yahoo and LINE both are quite popular in Japan, LINE is also big in Thailand as well.\n\nBut I want to ask for your insights, do you think which industries or companies in particular will perform well in this era of increasing isolation and escapism?\n\nThank you for reading!\n\n\n",

He has an audacious goal in mind, these people said. In his view, Meta can and should outstrip other tech companies in achieving what\u2019s known as artificial general intelligence or AGI, the notion that machines can perform as well as humans at many tasks. Once Meta reaches that milestone, it could weave the capability into its suite of products \u2014 not just social media and communications platforms, but also a range of AI tools, including the Meta chatbot and its AI-powered Ray-Ban glasses.\n\nZuckerberg aims to hire around 50 people for the new team, including a new head of AI research, almost all of whom he\u2019s recruiting personally. He\u2019s rearranged desks at the company\u2019s Menlo Park headquarters so the new staff will sit near him, the people said, asking to remain anonymous discussing private plans. \n\nZuckerberg is building that team in tandem with a planned multi-billion dollar investment in Scale AI, which offers data services to help companies train their models.

    "selftext": "# As Intel exits the trough of the semiconductor cycle, does AMD still have hope? Twice as many assets as AMD is the biggest advantage.\n\n**Undervalued giant vs. overhyped challenger**\n\n\n\nIn 2024, when INTEL released its third-quarter earnings report, its stock price collapsed. Countless AMD fans cheered, various remarks continued in X SPACE, and mainstream media began to relay such as\n\n>\\* INTEL is going to die, stupid guys actually have their own factories and workers.\n\n>\\* They should learn from AMD, don't need to have anything, light assets are right. AMD YES!\n\n>\\* In the German market, 99% of shipments are AMD and only 1% are INTEL. INTEL is dead.\n\n>\\* The coachman and driver in the steam engine era, no company should be eliminated more than INTEL, and INTEL actually has a factory, which is a shame for the United States.\n\n>\\* Look at what Apple does, they only do design, wake up, the United States does not need factories.\n\n>\\* AMD has been on a roll in recent years. Once seen as the underdog, it is now worth nearly twice as much as Intel\u2014and Intel has twice as many assets, its own fabs, a global supply chain, and arguably the most strategic position in U.S. semiconductor security.\n\nI have asked these people a question more than once: how to understand the semiconductor cycle? Do chip manufacturers really not need the entire industry chain? Taking a step back, INTEL is the real domestic chip security in the United States. And what it gets is always endless ridicule.\n\nBut is this shift entirely justified? Or is it a reflection of market sentiment, AI hype, and short-term memory?\n\nI have worked as an IT technical consultant in the manufacturing industry, and I still have a good understanding of production. I know very well that owning a factory will be a heavy burden, which will lead to a longer cycle and profit encroachment, but the advantage is that once you pass the trough, your own production capacity will be a nuclear-powered money printing machine.\n\nAnd based on China's experience, the security brought by own factories is far greater than outsourcing.\n\nI deeply remember what the former CEO of INTEL said, \"We added AI chips and AI computing to the motherboard, but we don't know what it can do. This is what the application layer does.\" INTEL's dilemma is actually the same as Apple's. They are honest people in the industry. They tell the truth, and capital does not need the truth.There are countless AI enthusiasts, non-IT personnel, and AI vested interests. They will infinitely exaggerate AI, even if it is like science fiction. But no one cares, because this is what capital needs.\n\n **The myth that \u201cbigger is not better\u201d**\n\nIntel is one of the few companies in the world with full-stack semiconductor capabilities\u2014from x86 architecture design to advanced process nodes, packaging, foundry services, and global distribution. Although costly, its fixed assets provide the United States and its allies with protection against geopolitical risks and long-term strategic autonomy.\n\n\n\nIn contrast, AMD adopts a fabless model\u2014lean, capital-efficient, and agile. But it also means AMD is heavily dependent on TSMC, a potential single point of failure. In times of peace and profitability, this may seem like an advantage. But in times of turmoil, this may not be the case.\n\n\n\nWhile the market currently rewards asset-light models with higher P/E ratios, one can't help but ask: What is the intrinsic value of resilience, control, and national independence in the post-globalization era?\n\n\n\n **Intel's decline is real - but so is its reconstruction**\n\nLet's be honest: Intel has made mistakes. Delays in 10nm, missed opportunities in mobile, and a slow transition to AI have damaged its credibility. Investors have lost patience.\n\n\n\nBut Intel today is not the Intel of 2018. Under CEO Pat Gelsinger, the company:\n\n\n\nIntroduced Intel 3G and 18A nodes ahead of schedule\n\n\n\nOpened its fabs (Intel foundries) to external customers\n\n\n\nGetted strong support through the CHIPS Act\n\n\n\nEntered AI accelerator market with Gaudi series chips\n\n\n\nWorked on IDM 2.0 strategy to regain manufacturing leadership\n\n\n\nThese are not promises on paper - they are capital-intensive, multi-year initiatives. If executed well, these initiatives may turn Intel from a \"value trap\" to a \"growth surprise\".\n\n\n\n **AMD: A great company, but is the hype sustainable?**\n\n\n\nTo be clear, AMD is a phenomenal success story. Lisa Su's leadership is a textbook case. Ryzen and EPYC have disrupted Intel's dominance in the consumer and data center markets. MI300X has now positioned AMD as the second-largest player in AI acceleration - second only to NVIDIA.\n\n\n\nHowever, AMD's stock price currently reflects its perfect execution in the extremely competitive AI market. Investors are betting that AMD will:\n\n\n\nSustain double-digit growth in the post-AI bubble era\n\n\n\nContinue to take market share from Intel and NVIDIA\n\n\n\nDeal with growing competition from internal accelerators (AWS, Google, Meta)\n\n\n\nThis won\u2019t be easy.\n\n\n\n**AI: A bursting bubble?**\n\n\n\nA large part of AMD\u2019s current valuation stems from the AI \u200b\u200bhype cycle. But problems are emerging:\n\n\n\nAI capex at hyperscalers is slowing\n\n\n\nTech giants are developing their own chips, reducing their reliance on AMD/NVIDIA\n\n\n\nMany AI startups that received funding in 2021-2023 are now working to monetize their models\n\n\n\nIf AI enters the \u201cnormalization phase,\u201d the outsized expectations associated with AMD may come under pressure. Meanwhile, Intel\u2014whose stock price already reflects pessimism\u2014has less to lose and more to gain.\n\n\n\n**Strategic value: Intel is more than a company\u2014it\u2019s infrastructure**\n\n\n\nIntel is more than a chipmaker. It\u2019s the backbone of America\u2019s technological sovereignty.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s the only US company with cutting-edge node ambitions\n\n\n\nIt provides CPUs for defense, aviation, infrastructure, and edge computing\n\n\n\nIts survival is seen as a national interest\n\n\n\nWhile this doesn\u2019t guarantee profits, it guarantees protection. Intel\u2019s valuation has a floor \u2014 and, when the cycle turns, its ceiling could be much higher than its current valuation.\n\n\n\n**Valuation Snapshot: 2025 (as of May)**\n\n\n\nMetrics: Intel AMD\n\nMarket Cap \\~$130B \\~$260B\n\nTotal Assets \\~$190B \\~$70B\n\nExpected P/E \\~33x \\~45x\n\nR&D Spending (TTM) \\~$17B \\~$6B\n\nRevenue (TTM) \\~$55B \\~$23B\n\n\n\nIf the semiconductor cycle turns, as it has historically, and Intel\u2019s foundry and AI businesses are able to succeed, this valuation gap may seem absurd in hindsight.\n\n\n\n**Bottom line: $18 is too cheap, but $38 isn\u2019t too expensive**\n\nIntel\u2019s 2022-2023 collapse was painful but also cleansing. Now it stands on the brink of a new chapter \u2014 AI, independent foundry, and a return to competitive execution.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, AMD, while still great, may have peaked in its narrative power.\n\n\n\nSo the question remains:\n\n\n\nWhen the cycle turns, will Intel \u2014 the undervalued giant \u2014 make a strong comeback? And if so, where will AMD go when the music stops?",

    "title": "What a UAE Deal Might Mean For SMCI",
    "selftext": "This has been a pretty eventful week for SMCI and the AI sector as a whole. the acquisition of a [$20 billion deal](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/saudis-datavolt-signs-20bn-deal-with-supermicro/) with DataVolt in Saudi Arabia and a 39% jump in share price off the strength of the news and overall AI sentiment improving is enough to make any degen hard as solid veiny diamonds. One thing this week that has especially caught my eye is UAE's plan to construct a [5GW AI Campus](https://www.commerce.gov/news/press-releases/2025/05/uae-and-us-presidents-attend-unveiling-phase-1-new-5gw-ai-campus-abu), with the help of G42, that will house 5GW worth of data center racks and span **10 square miles**.\n\nTo put this into perspective, thats:\n\n* 50k 100kW full-scale liquid-cooled racks\n* 3.2 **million** Nvidia Blackwell (B100) chips\n* More power than NYC and San Francisco **combined**\n* Equivalent to powering **3-4 million** homes or running **50 million** gaming PCs at full power 24/7\n\nAs you can see, this is an insanely ambitious feat the UAE is trying to achieve. Nonetheless, I couldn't help but ask myself, of the roughly 50k racks the UAE plans to procure, how many of those racks will be SMCI? Furthermore, whatever amount of racks SMCI does provide, how much money does SMCI stand to make from the project? Most importantly, What does that mean for the share price?\n\nFirst, we need to understand what DCBBS is, and how it actually benefits customers with large scale projects like the UAE AI Campus.\n\nDCBBS stands for **Direct Connect Backplane Building Block Solutions**, and it\u2019s SMCI's proprietary system architecture for building **full AI racks,** not just individual servers. This means when a customer selects which AI rack configuration they want, when it arrives at their door, it comes in a form [like this](https://trendspider.com/blog/dell-and-super-micro-power-musks-ai-ambitions/). In other words, customers are getting Kitchen-Aid refrigerators sent to their fucking door that contain 30-90 Nvidia Blackwell chips and liquid cooling systems within them. No more receiving your SMCI rack order in individual server pieces that you have to assemble on your own. This greatly increases the speed in which these new data centers can go live. In most cases, these racks can be installed and plugged in in **under a day.**\n\nAdditionally, this also helps to increase their margins over time.\n\nTraditionally, SMCI sold servers as modular building blocks. things like:\n\n* 1U and 2U server chassis\n* Motherboards\n* Power supplies\n* GPU trays\n\nCustomers (like system integrators, VARs, or hyperscalers) would assemble these into racks themselves. That\u2019s low-margin business, because you\u2019re selling parts, not solutions. the DCBBS racks contain:\n\n* CPU & GPU servers (e.g., Nvidia Blackwell, AMD EPYC, Intel Gaudi)\n* Total liquid cooling (cold plates, manifolds, chillers, etc.)\n* Network switches\n* Rack management software\n* Power distribution units (PDUs)\n\nWhy does this new model increase margins? Because it is a shift SMCI is making, from selling modular pieces that must be assembled, to selling complete solutions that are pre-assembled and ready for use upon arrival. This gives SMCI increased pricing power and in turn, increased margins. Below is a comparison table to illustrate the logic:\n\n|Old Model (Per Server)|Rack-Scale Model (Per Rack)|\n|:-|:-|\n|Sell parts separately|Sell the full system integration|\n|$5K\u2013$15K ASP/server|$250K\u2013$2M ASP per rack|\n|6\u201310% gross margin|**15\u201325%+ gross margin**|\n|Low-value add|**Turnkey AI solution** = premium pricing|\n\nNow lets go more in depth:\n\n**1. Higher Average Selling Price (ASP) per Unit**\n\n* Traditional air-cooled servers sell for **$10K\u2013$50K** each.\n* Liquid-cooled **DCBBS racks** (often 64\u201396 GPUs) sell for **$2\u20135 million per rack**.\n* Even if gross margins stay in the 8\u201310% range, **gross profit per rack is 40\u00d7\u201380\u00d7 higher** than per-server sales.\n\nHigher ASP = greater dollar-margin per unit sold, allowing SMCI to increase overall margins even with a similar percentage.\n\n**2. Bundled Value = Control Over Margin Levers**\n\nWith DCBBS, SMCI is not just selling a server, it\u2019s delivering:\n\n* 8\u201312 liquid-cooled GPU servers\n* 2000+ liquid-cooled racks a month\n* Integrated CDUs (coolant distribution units)\n* Power delivery + networking\n* Cabling, plumbing, and chassis integration\n* Software/BIOS optimization\n\nAll of these are designed, manufactured, and **assembled in-house**, which means:\n\n1. Vertical integration reduces dependency on low-margin commodity components\n2. Custom bundles let SMCI charge more for value-added services\n3. Standardization improves yield, reduces warranty risk, and shortens labor cycles\n\n**3. Faster Time-to-Deployment = Premium Pricing Power**\n\nSMCI can ship **fully integrated, plug-and-play racks in 3\u20134 weeks**, while others take 8\u201312 weeks+ with multiple vendors.\n\nFor hyperscalers and AI startups racing to bring GPU clusters online, this **speed translates into willingness to pay more**, or at least not negotiate down.\n\nFor example: A customer buying a $2.5M rack from SMCI may avoid:\n\n* Extra $500k/month in AI cloud rental costs\n* 3\u20134 month delay in deploying AI training models\n* Facility delays in retrofitting for traditional HVAC-based servers\n\nBelow is a table below comparing liquid-cooled racks Time-to-Deployment between SMCI and its competitors:\n\n|**Vendor**|**Liquid-Cooled Rack Output (Est.)**|**Time to Deployment**|**Notes**|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|**SMCI**|**\\~2,000+ racks/month**|**3\u20134 weeks** (from factory)|DCBBS fully integrated, scalable, Blackwell-ready|\n|**Dell**|*Unknown (not disclosed)*|\\~6\u201310 weeks (unverified)|IR7000 liquid-cooled racks for hyperscalers, but no output figures released|\n|**HPE**|*Limited modular deployments*|\\~8\u201312 weeks (pods)|Offers liquid-cooled AI systems (e.g. Cray EX, Apollo), but mostly for supercomputing clients|\n|**Lenovo**|*Unknown*|6+ weeks (via FIS programs)|Neptune liquid cooling, but most integration is not turnkey at SMCI pace|\n\nThis \u201ctime-value\u201d premium enhances margin per contract.\n\n**4. Liquid Cooling = Lower Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) for Clients**\n\nClients benefit from:\n\n* 30\u201350%+ reduction in power usage (no fans/blowers at server level)\n* Higher rack density \u2192 fewer racks \u2192 less real estate\n* Reduced HVAC burden \u2192 capex + opex savings\n\nBecause DCBBS racks are pre-validated and ready for 80\u2013100+ kW loads, customers can safely go denser per rack \u2014 which:\n\n* Makes SMCI\u2019s per-rack offering more economically valuable\n* Lets them preserve pricing vs. air-cooled OEMs like Lenovo, HPE, or Dell, who may cut prices to remain competitive\n\nHigher value-to-customer means more pricing power = higher gross margin\n\n**5. Operational Efficiency at Scale**\n\nSMCI is building out:\n\n* A 3 million square foot manufacturing campus in Silicon Valley and Malaysia\n* A supply chain optimized for GPU pre-allocation, liquid cooling parts, and just-in-time rack assembly\n\nThis allows SMCI to:\n\n* Mass produce racks with minimal retooling\n* Reduce per-rack cost at high volume\n* Use contract-based repeat orders (like the DataVolt $20B deal) to plan capacity\n\nEconomies of scale + predictable assembly processes = declining cost/unit \u2192 rising margin\n\nBelow is a comparison table illustrating the margin impact:\n\n|**Advantage**|**Margin Impact**|\n|:-|:-|\n|High ASP per rack|Higher gross profit in dollar terms|\n|Bundled hardware/services|Increases perceived value + vertical profit|\n|Speed to deploy (3-4 weeks)|Pricing premium vs. slower OEMs|\n|Energy/cooling savings for customer|Improves TCO \u2192 preserves SMCI pricing power|\n|Factory integration at scale|Lowers per-rack cost with volume|\n\nSo far, we've learned how DCBBS can substantially decrease build times for customers and how it could potentially increase margins for SMCI.\n\nNow to the fun part: The UAE Deal\n\nAfter doing some ape fisted carpet eating math, I estimate that the total cost of the 5GW AI Campus would be about $125 billion (assuming **each rack** draws about 100kW and sells for $2.5 million). Based on these numbers, I had ChatGPT build a table with a break down of what SMCI would get based on various percentages of the project they would be responsible for and superimposed a likelihood of occurrence formula in there:\n\n|Coverage %|Likelihood of Occurrence|Racks Provided|G42 Total Payment to SMCI|Estimated Gross Profit (USD) 9.7%|Estimated EBITDA (USD)|Estimated EPS|Implied Share Price (@20x PE)|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|1%|Highly Likely (90%)|500|$1,250,000,000|$121,250,000|$103,062,500|$1.87|$37.40|\n|2%|Very Likely (80%)|1000|$2,500,000,000|$242,500,000|$206,125,000|$3.75|$75.00|\n|5%|Likely (65%)|2500|$6,250,000,000|$606,250,000|$515,312,500|$9.37|$187.40|\n|10%|Possible (45%)|5000|$12,500,000,000|$1,212,500,000|$1,030,625,000|$18.74|$374.80|\n|25%|Plausible (25%)|12500|$31,250,000,000|$3,031,250,000|$2,576,562,500|$46.84|$936.80|\n|50%|Unlikely (10%)|25000|$62,500,000,000|$6,062,500,000|$5,153,125,000|$93.70|$1,874.00|\n|100%|Very Unlikely (3%)|50000|$125,000,000,000|$12,125,000,000|$10,306,250,000|$187.40|$3,748.00|\n\nAs you can see, even with a conservative PE of 20x and 9.7% margins, if SMCI gets even 2-5% of the project, thats an EPS of $3.75-9.37 and a share price of $75-187 a share.\n\n**How ChatGPT Calculated the Likelihoods**\n\nThis wasn\u2019t a statistical model but rather a strategic probability estimate based on 5 weighted factors:\n\n**1. Historical Precedent (30%)**\n\n* No hyperscaler or government has ever given 100% of a 5GW AI deployment to one vendor.\n* Datavolt gave SMCI a $20B deal, but likely part of a larger multi-phase build \u2014 suggesting up to 25% is plausible.\n\n**2. Industry Norm for Diversification (25%)**\n\n* Large clients (e.g. AWS, G42, Meta) **split procurement across 2\u20134 OEMs** for risk mitigation, price leverage, and geopolitical hedging.\n* Most national-scale AI campuses split rack-scale work among **Dell, Lenovo, HPE, SMCI, Nvidia integrators**, etc.\n\n**3. SMCI Production Capacity (20%)**\n\n* SMCI can output \\~5,000 racks/month total, **2,000+ liquid cooled**.\n* To hit 50\u2013100% coverage of a 5GW facility, they\u2019d need to commit 6\u201312 months of global capacity, which limits probability unless it's multi-year.\n\n**4. Geopolitical Alignment (15%)**\n\n* SMCI already has deep regional partnerships (Saudi Arabia, Abu Dhabi), so 10\u201325% is well within reach.\n* But **50\u2013100%** would likely require **exclusive national alignment**, which is rare unless the vendor is sovereign or majority-owned.\n\n**5. First-Mover Advantage & Time-to-Deploy (10%)**\n\n* SMCI\u2019s lead time (3\u20134 weeks vs. 8\u201312 weeks) is a massive advantage.\n* For urgency-sensitive contracts, this could **justify awarding 25% or more** \u2014 but not 100%, barring a disruption in Dell/HPE supply.\n\nI think its also important to add, two job listenings have been posted for positions in Abu Dhabi:\n\n[Account Sales Manager](https://jobs.supermicro.com/job/United-Arab-Emirates-Abu-Dha-Sales-Account-Manager/1148026500/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n\n[Technology Enablement Engineer](https://jobs.supermicro.com/job/United-Arab-Emirates-Abu-Dha-Technology-Enablement-Engineer/1246502400/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n\n\n\nAll in all, SMCI could stand to make a assload of money from a G42 UAE deal.\n\nLast but not least, Cramer is [\u201cSick of\u201d](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/topstocks/jim-cramer-is-sick-of-super-micro-computer-stock-should-you-sell-smci-now/ar-AA1F0NkN?ocid=finance-verthp-feeds) SMCI\n\n  \nTL:DR: SMCI provides the fastest Time-to-Deployment of any of its competitors with its liquid-cooled DCBBS solution and this could help increase margins overtime and make it a more attractive buy to larger customers ready to deploy immediately. Capturing even 5% of the G42 UAE deal could result in a share price of $180+ a share. SMCI is already hiring for positions in Abu Dhabi.\n\nPosition: 15 $91c 1/16",

    "selftext": "I've seen the claim over and over that Gemini 2.5 Pro is the best LLM on the market, with many Redditors citing Chatbot arena rankings.\n\nI was surprised by this, because in my anecdotal experience, Gemini 2.5 pro consistently performs worse than even the faster /cheaper OpenAI models like 4o. So I looked into this, and found this paper:\n\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20879\n\nThis paper points out many flaws with Chat Arena's rankings, which lead to flawed results:\n\n1. Google is able to submit dozens of private models, retract scores they don't like, and only publicly release the one that scores best. This leads to situations where they can \"cherry pick\" a model that scores best, which may either be overfitted to the benchmark, or score better by pure chance.\n\nThis would be like the equivalent of if you're in a college class, and allowed a single notecard for a final exam. You can take the test unlimited times, but you forget the contents of the test after. You then take the test 50 times, each time changing the content of your notecard each time. Eventually, you select the test in which you scored best, and submit that, and score top of your class, because everyone else took the test less. That's essentially what Google is doing.\n\nGoogle had the 2nd most privately tested models at 10, after Meta, at 27. In comparison, OpenAI only had 2,X ai had 1.\n\n2. Google has the highest \"sampling rate\" on Chatbot arena. Rather than sampling models evenly, the benchmark is biased on favor of Google. This gives them more opportunities to \"cherry pick\" the best scoring model.\n\n3. This process of submitting many models, and publicly releasing the one that scores leads to overfitting, or a case where a model is optimized to perform very well in a benchmark/training data, but does very poorly in real world performance.\n\n4. Models such as OpenAI's models are trained based on real world user feedback(thumbs up/thumbs down). Google is cherry picking their models based on arbitrary queries that are not real world usage. This leads to results that do not perform well in the real world.\n\nIf you think Google truly has the best model, I'd recommend using it, and actually scrutinizing what it tells you. You'll find that it frequently provides convincing responses that are completely wrong.",

    "title": "Three fundamentally strong companies, temporarily mispriced due to short-term fears",
    "selftext": "I've been digging into a few high-quality businesses that I believe are facing temporary dislocations. Below are my analyses of Novo Nordisk ($NVO), Bruker Corp. ($BRKR), and The Trade Desk ($TTD). I believe that each of these companies are showing strong long-term fundamentals, but are trading well below intrinsic value.\u00a0\n\nNovo Nordisk ($NVO)\n\nThis is a classic case of \u201cshort term fear, long term value\u201d. Novo Nordisk is a global leader in GLP-1\u2013based treatments for diabetes and obesity, with drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy. Despite continued double-digit revenue and earnings growth, the stock has dropped over 50% YTD. This is primarily due to concerns over market share gains by Eli Lilly and others, short-term supply constraints, and fears of margin compression. These concerns, while not unfounded, appear significantly overblown relative to the company\u2019s long-term fundamentals.\n\nCrucially, the GLP-1 market is not a winner-takes-all market. The market is expanding rapidly and I believe they can support multiple dominant players. Novo still holds best-in-class margins (>35%), a robust product pipeline (e.g. CagriSema), and global distribution infrastructure. The obesity therapeutics market is forecast to exceed $130B by 2030, meaning even a modestly declining market share can still translate into absolute revenue and profit growth. Therefore, I believe the current sentiment-driven pricing creates a clear mispricing where fair value lies in the $110\u2013$140 range. Novo is a high-quality compounder caught in a temporary dislocation. Not a value trap, but a classic contrarian long. The strategic collaboration with Hims & Hers ($HIMS) and CVS ($CVS) may be a catalyst for the price to rebound quickly.\n\nBruker Corp. ($BRKR)\n\nBruker Corp. builds advanced scientific instruments used in life sciences and materials research, including cancer diagnostics and drug development. Despite growing revenue by 13.6% in 2024 and maintaining strong free cash flow, the stock has dropped over 50% since late 2024. The decline stems from short-term margin pressure, weakness in China/biopharma demand, and costs tied to a strategic reorganization aimed at scaling operations and unlocking long-term efficiencies.\n\nThis reorganization, including several acquisitions, temporarily weighs on margins, but positions Bruker for stronger profitability over time. I believe that the market is mispricing this short-term transition as a structural decline. Insiders and Michael Burry seem to think so as well, as they have initiated positions in the last months. With the stock trading at attractive multiples (compared to hystorical multiples and its peers) and core markets like proteomics still expanding, Bruker looks undervalued. With forward EPS of around $2.70 and an average P/E-ratio of around 30, a re-rating toward $80 is likely if margins rebound and sentiment shifts.\n\nThe Trade Desk ($TTD)\n\nThe Trade Desk is a leading independent demand-side platform (DSP) enabling advertisers to allocate digital ad budgets effectively, with a strong presence in connected TV, retail media, and cookieless identity solutions through its UID2.0 framework. The stock has fallen over 60% from around $140 in late 2024 to $53 as of now. This is due to weaker-than-expected forward guidance, delays in launching its AI-based platform Kokai, and a broader market rotation away from high-multiple tech stocks.\n\nHowever, the sell-off seems a major overreaction of the market. The company remains highly profitable, continues growing revenue at 20%+ annually, generates strong free cash flow, and maintains incredible customer retention rates of >95%. Secular tailwinds in streaming and privacy-focused ad tech support long-term demand for its platform. The market seems to be mispricing a temporary slowdown as a structural decline. Based on their growth, their postion as market leader, and hystorical multiples, I believe the fair value to be at least $100 in the short term. This feels just like Meta ($META) at $90 in 2022.",

My largest buys have been in TSM, NVDA, ORCL, CAVA, AMZN, MSFT, META & SMH.\n\n1. Largest tax cut in history is coming. Republicans own the house and senate, and Trump is deadset on cutting taxes by $5 trillion. Obviously not good for the national debt but that will juice the economy big time. \n\n2. Midterms are coming in 2026, and Trump will not want to have a recession on his hands which would risk him loosing the house and senate. I am fully convinced he launched this tariff war so early on, so he could get it over with before midterms. Trump has pivoted extremely quickly on all reciprocal tariffs aside from china. And he is desperate to start negotiations with china. China and the U.S have both entered a de escalatatory tone, with both sides  making exemptions to tariffs, china expressing willingness to deal with fentanyl, and acknowledging the desire to negotiate- along side acknowledging that the U.S has reached out to them. They are BOTH eager to water down these tariffs and deep down, when both parties want the same thing (reduced tariffs) they will find a way to get it despite all the public bluster. Even if a deal could take months, they will likely have a pause either during or before negotiations. \n\n\n3. Rate cuts are coming later this year. It\u2019s likely there will be at least 2 rate cuts before year\u2019s end assuming tariff inflation does not cause extreme inflation. Rate cuts will boost the ability to borrow capital, increase liquidity and stimulating the economy. \n\n4. We are at the dawn of the largest productivity revolution in history. Everyone has seemed to forget about AI despite big tech earnings and guidance blowing it out of the park. MSFT, GOOG, and META are printing money, and AI is showing incredible returns in the semiconductor and data center space. We are still in the early stages of AI, the smarter it gets the more productivity will increase. \n\n5. The economy is currently strong. Jobs numbers in April (not a lagging indicator) were impressive. At the end of the day, so long as people are not losing their jobs the U.S consumer will stay resilient. Tariff effects could disrupt that if they stay in effect long term. However I think it\u2019s pretty obvious the worst of the tariffs are temporary. \n\n6. U.S exceptionalism is nowhere close to ending. We are miles ahead of every other economy in terms of innovation and technology. We lead in services, and nobody is boycotting GOOG, META, MSFT etc in a significant way. These innovative tech companies exist nowhere else in scale and success. Our consumer is 30% of the global economy and nowhere do they have such a wealthy large pool of consumers. We are still the world reserve currency with 59% of currency held abroad is dollars. And nobody, even Trump will let us lose that reserve currency status.",

    "selftext": "I have seen only minimal talks in the sub about the current AdTech antitrust lawsuit and what it means for the company. I have posted the ft article below to start some discussion. Feel free to join.\n\nFT article (02.05.2025):\n\nThe US Department of Justice said it will seek to force Google parent Alphabet to sell key parts of its digital advertising business, which was found to constitute an illegal monopoly.\n\nThe DoJ on Friday told a federal judge that divestments of Google\u2019s ad exchange and publisher ad server businesses are the only way to break its dominance. The former is the largest marketplace for bidding for online ad space and the latter is the technology online publishers use to list and sell ads on their websites.\n\nThe tech giant should also be required to share data on real-time ad bidding with competitors, the DoJ said in a Virginia court. US district Judge Leonie Brinkema set a trial date of September 22 to hear the proposals and Google\u2019s rebuttals.\n\nLast month, Brinkema ruled against Google, finding it had \u201cwilfully\u201d monopolised the online advertising market through acquisitions and by tying together its ad exchange and publisher server to shut out competitors and undercut them on pricing.\n\nHowever, she rejected part of the justice department\u2019s case, saying it was not able to prove Google unfairly dominated the third component of the market, advertiser ad networks.\n\nGoogle has protested the ruling, saying it competes for online ad spending with other tech groups such as Meta, Amazon and TikTok. The company\u2019s lawyers say it is willing to share real-time ad exchange data with rivals, but not sell any parts of its business.\n\nLee-Anne Mulholland, Google\u2019s head of regulatory affairs, said: \u201cThe DoJ\u2019s additional proposals to force a divestiture of our ad tech tools go well beyond the court\u2019s findings, have no basis in law, and would harm publishers and advertisers.\u201d\n\nAd tech is the third antitrust case Alphabet has lost in quick succession. Last year, another judge found it had also developed a monopoly in search by paying Apple more than $20bn a year to be the default browser on its devices. The DoJ has requested Google sell its chrome browser and share search data with rivals.\n\nChief executive Sundar Pichai on Wednesday appeared in a Washington court in the search remedies trial and argued the proposals were \u201cfar-reaching, so extraordinary\u201d and amounted to giving away its intellectual property for free to rivals that could reverse engineer its search engine. He also said sharing data would jeopardise users\u2019 privacy.\n\nAlphabet has also been ordered to open up its Android operation system to rivals after a San Francisco judge found it used its Google Play Store to suppress competition in apps and charge excessive fees.",

Their positive outlooks contrasted with Apple\u2019s weaker China sales-down to $16 billion-and Amazon\u2019s cloud growth missing expectations, both dragging their stocks lower after hours. Despite the rally, concerns remain: the Magnificent Seven tech stocks, which make up about a third of the S&P 500\u2019s $47.2 trillion market value, still trade at high valuations (28x earnings, just below the five-year average of 33), and tariffs are raising costs across tech supply chains, especially for hardware firms heavily reliant on Asia. Analysts warn that even megacap tech is not immune to the long-term risks of tariffs, as shown by Nvidia\u2019s projected $5.5 billion charge from U.S. export restrictions to China. With market volatility high and valuations stretched, experts recommend diversifying into sectors like financials and healthcare, which have lower forward P/Es (17x for both) and are showing stronger earnings momentum-financials\u2019 earnings forecasts are up 4.5% this year, led by a 10.6% boost for investment banks and about 8% for diversified banks and consumer finance.",

Analysts were expecting 107.3 million.\n\nReddit has been a big beneficiary from\u00a0Google search changes and internal site improvements, which has led to an influx of new and returning users, which it refers to as logged-out users. The social media firm has focused on site updates and features intended to convince logged-out users to create accounts and become logged-in users, which are more valuable to advertisers.\n\nThe company\u2019s first-quarter global logged-in DAUq rose 23% year over year to 48.7 million, while its global logged-out DAUq jumped 38% to 59.4 million.\n\nIn February, Reddit said that a Google search algorithm change temporarily impacted the company\u2019s user growth\u00a0during the fourth quarter. Search-driven traffic soon recovered in the first quarter, the company said at the time.\n\nReddit isn\u2019t the only company to weigh in on macroeconomic challenges.\n\nMeta\u00a0shares rose Thursday after the company reported\u00a0first-quarter earnings\u00a0that beat on the top and bottom. However, the company\u2019s advertising sales in the Asia-Pacific region came in at $8.22 billion for the first quarter, which was lower than analysts estimates of $8.42 billion.\n\nSusan Li, Meta\u2019s finance chief,\u00a0said that\u00a0\u201cAsia-based e-commerce exporters\u201d have reduced their digital ad spending likely due to the de minimis trade loophole\u00a0ending Friday.\n\nSnap\u00a0reported its latest earnings on Tuesday and said it \u201cexperienced headwinds\u00a0to start the current quarter,\u201d and declined to provide guidance because of macroeconomic uncertainties.\n\nAlphabet\u00a0reported\u00a0first-quarter earnings\u00a0last week, and said that Google Advertising sales jumped 8.5% year over year to $66.89 billion while YouTube ad sales rose 10% to $8.93 billion.\n\nSource: [https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/01/reddit-rddt-q1-2025.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/01/reddit-rddt-q1-2025.html)",

I personally had the bias that it would actually be bullish for the company, so I'll likely trade a second move rather than the first if I'm at the computer for the trade.

Companies that rent out computing space such as CRWV also moved higher on this as well.

    "selftext": "Hi! I am an ex-prop shop equity trader. This is a daily watchlist for short-term trading: I might trade all/none of the stocks listed, and even stocks not listed! I am targeting potentially good candidates for short-term trading; I have no opinion on them as investments. The potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting, everything else is secondary.\n\nBad news economic data today, things are going to get wild.\n\nNews: [Us Economy Contracts For First Time Since 2022 On Imports Surge](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-30/us-economy-contracts-for-first-time-since-2022-on-imports-surge)\n\n[**SMCI (Super Micro Computer)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SMCI&p=d)\\- SMCI preannounced disappointing Q3 FY2025 results, with revenue expected between $4.5B\u2013$4.6B vs. $5.5B expected, and non-GAAP EPS of $0.29\u2013$0.31 vs. $0.54 expected. SMCI attributed the shortfall to delayed customer platform decisions and higher inventory reserves from older generation products. We're close to 20% down and with all the negative news on semi competition from China and server costs, I'm looking to play a bounce in this if the selloff gets worse. No real level I'm watching, likely will move with the market today. SMCI cited that inventory is increasing and as a result affected NVDA/DELL afterhours as well. DELL is down 6%! Potential supply chain disruptions like tariffs continue to be the biggest risk. \n\n[**SPY (S&P 500 ETF)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SPY&p=d) / [**QQQ (NASDAQ-100 ETF)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=QQQ&p=d)\\- The U.S. economy contracted by 0.3% in Q1 2025, marking the first decline since 2022, driven by a surge in imports and decreased government spending. Jamie Dimon said that a recession is a \"best case scenario\", ultimately looking at how bad the selloff will be today. The broader market is grappling with uncertainties stemming from trade tensions and tariff implementations, and the contraction news. Might take a minor VXX long as well \n\n[**NVDA (NVIDIA)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&p=d)\\- DeepSeek released its Prover-V2-671B model on Hugging Face, a 671B parameter AI model trained on Huawei\u2019s Ascend 910B chips. Obviously bad if Deepseek can release a competitive model that wasn't built on NVDA's chips like last time. This was also affected by SMCI news, so I'm interested in this today if we near $100 near the open.\n\n[**SNAP (Snap Inc.)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SNAP&p=d)\\- Snap reported Q1 2025 revenue of $1.36B vs. $1.35B expected, with a net loss of $140M, narrowing from the previous year. Daily active users reached 460 million, slightly above expectations. However, the company declined to provide Q2 guidance, citing macroeconomic uncertainties. Interested in this below $7, otherwise not interested mainly due to all the other things going on today. The digital advertising sector faces challenges due to changing trade policies and economic uncertainties, impacting revenue streams for advertising. Ultimately can be a huge loser if tariffs/recession goes through.\n\n**Earnings today:** MSFT, META, HOOD, QCOM",

    "title": "Barrons: Why Trump\u2019s Next 100 Days Will Be More Crucial for Stock Markets and 5 Other Things to Know Today.",
    "selftext": "While the first 100 days of Donald Trump\u2019s Presidency have been dismal for stock markets, the next 100 could be crucial-and things are starting to look brighter.\n\nThe S&P 500 has fallen 7.8% since Trump took office in January\u2014on track for the worst start to a presidency since Richard Nixon\u2019s second term in 1973, according to Dow Jones Market Data.\n\nBut the period is ending on a strong note after the index notched its fifth consecutive day of gains Monday, the longest winning streak this year.\n\nThe next 100 days should feature several deals between the U.S. and its major trading partners. It\u2019s already day 20 of Trump\u2019s 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs but Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Monday that deals with India and South Korea are close.\n\nThere are more signs of tariffs being eased\u2013Trump is expected to water down auto levies Tuesday and Bessent said it was up to China to de-escalate trade tensions between the world\u2019s two largest economies. Both sides appear open to working things out.\n\nWhile tax cuts may materialize in the summer, lifting consumers\u2019 finances, the impact of tariffs will likely start to hurt them sooner, hitting shoppers and the economy hard\u2013unless the White House rows back considerably on the levies it has announced so far.\n\nThere\u2019s still time to avoid the worst of the damage. Corporate earnings so far paint a picture of uncertainty, rather than one of disaster\u2013and the same can be said for economic data.\n\nEarnings from four of the so-called Magnificent Seven megacap stocks\u2013Meta, Microsoft, Amazon and Apple\u2013will kick off the next 100 days. If the Big Tech momentum started by Alphabet last week can continue, then the market\u2019s recovery can gather pace.\n\nUltimately, though, trade developments will dictate the market moves. After 100 days of nasty surprises, some pleasant ones may be on the way.\n\n**Tariff Revenue So Far Falls Short of President\u2019s Number**\n\nPresident Donald Trump has boasted that his import tariffs are bringing in $3 billion of revenue a day, suggesting they could one day replace income taxes. But the Treasury\u2019s daily statements show much lower tariff receipts, certainly not enough to replace the billions a day collected in individual income tax.\n\n\u2022\tSince tariffs rates were raised to current levels on April 9, the U.S. has collected $14.7 billion in revenue from imports. While that\u2019s a 135% jump from the same time in 2024 and higher than import revenue in March, it adds up to a daily average of $918 million, or less than one-third of Trump\u2019s estimate.\n\n\u2022\tIndividual income tax totaled $6.6 billion a day last year. To reach that, tariffs would have to be 74%, which would effectively cut off trade and thus blunt tariff collections. Tariffs are currently set at 10% across the board, 25% for certain products, and 145% for goods from China.\n\n\u2022\tMain Street is reacting to tariffs and Trump\u2019s trade war by cutting jobs and slowing hiring, Hasbro is cutting $1 billion in costs, and Dow has postponed capital spending because of tariff uncertainty. Norfolk Southern CEO Mark George said the company is trying to \u201ccontrol the controllables.\u201d\n\n\u2022\tChinese goods exported to the U.S. are expected to contract by two-thirds this year if tariffs are maintained, according to a Goldman Sachs report. Goods from the communication equipment, apparel, and chemical product sectors represent a high share of China\u2019s U.S.-bound goods.",

    "selftext": "For Meta Platforms (META), the upcoming earnings call (scheduled for April 30, after market close) is highly anticipated, especially with big tech volatility and renewed focus on AI, advertising, and cost control. Here are the most important things to watch and key questions the market will focus on:\n\n# 1.\u00a0Advertising Revenue & AI Initiatives\n\n* **Core Focus:**\u00a0Analysts expect AI-driven improvements in ad targeting and engagement to drive modest revenue and EPS beats, with estimates at $41.36 billion in revenue and $5.21 EPS.\n* **Watch for:**\n   * Specific numbers and commentary on AI\u2019s impact on ad efficiency and pricing.\n   * Competitive positioning versus other social platforms and Google.\n   * How AI tools are translating into measurable monetization gains.\n\n# 2.\u00a0Cost Controls & Margins\n\n* **Key Metrics:**\u00a0Operating margin, net margin, and cash flow are in focus as META\u2019s cost discipline has been a major driver of stock gains recently.\n* **Watch for:**\n   * Updated cost guidance, especially R&D and infrastructure spend for AI.\n   * Is cost discipline sustainable, or is spending ramping up again (especially for Reality Labs and AI infrastructure)?\n\n# 3.\u00a0Reality Labs / Metaverse Segment\n\n* **Trends Analysis:**\u00a0There\u2019s been a major spike in public interest in Reality Labs in the last few months, likely tied to new product launches or AI innovations.\n* **Watch for:**\n   * Progress on AR/VR devices, user engagement metrics, and revenue/cost breakdowns.\n   * Management\u2019s view on the timeline for profitability in Reality Labs.\n\n# 4.\u00a0Regulatory Risks & Shareholder Proposals\n\n* **News Focus:**\u00a0Ongoing regulatory scrutiny (antitrust, privacy, content) and a notable shareholder proposal addressing online antisemitism and hate speech risks.\n* **Watch for:**\n   * Management\u2019s commentary on legal and regulatory headwinds.\n   * Updates on how META is addressing shareholder concerns regarding platform safety and governance.\n\n# 5.\u00a0AI Spending & Geopolitical Headwinds\n\n* **News Focus:**\u00a0Investor concerns about Meta\u2019s AI capex amid tariff and trade policy uncertainty (especially with recent political headlines).\n* **Watch for:**\n   * Any adjustments to AI/data center spending plans.\n   * Management\u2019s assessment of tariff/trade impacts on supply chain and costs.\n\n# 6.\u00a0Valuation & Guidance\n\n* **Current Valuation:**\u00a0META\u2019s trailing P/E is \\~22.3, with strong growth (EPS up 62% YoY, revenue up 22% YoY) but recent stock price pullback (down \\~28% from peak).\n* **Watch for:**\n   * Updated guidance for Q2 and full-year\u2014are growth and margin targets intact?\n   * Commentary on buybacks or potential capital returns (dividends, repurchases).\n\n# What Analysts & the Market Want to Hear\n\n* Evidence that AI is not just a buzzword but is materially driving revenue and efficiency.\n* Confidence that META can navigate regulatory and cost challenges without derailing growth.\n* A roadmap for profitability or meaningful traction from Reality Labs.\n* Clarity on spending discipline and capital allocation priorities.\n\n# Trends & Sentiment\n\n* Public and market interest in Reality Labs is surging, while the core Family of Apps sees steady but less dramatic attention\u2014pointing to high expectations for innovation and new product cycles.\n* Sentiment remains cautiously optimistic but sensitive to any negative surprises, especially on costs or regulatory issues.\n\n**Action Item:**\u00a0Listen for specifics on AI monetization, cost outlook, regulatory strategy, and Reality Labs progress. Management\u2019s tone and detail on these fronts will likely drive META\u2019s post-earnings price action.",

    "selftext": "Stocks closed mixed on Monday but recovered from sharp losses to begin a big week of heavyweight earnings reports and macroeconomic data that will continue to paint an early picture of the US economy's response to President Trump's tariffs.\n\nThe S&P 500 (^GSPC) erased losses of as much as 1% to rise just above the flatline. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) edged up 0.3%, notching its longest win streak of 2025. Both indexes ended in positive territory for the fifth straight day.\n\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) fell below the flatline, as shares of Big Tech recovered from steep early-session losses.\n\nWall Street is coming off a rebounding run last week. The gains came as Trump eased pressure on Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, and hinted at light at the end of the tunnel for sky-high 145% tariffs on China. On Monday, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said it was \"up to China\" to deescalate the trade battle, though he suggested its recent moves to exempt certain US goods from duties represented a positive step.\n\nEarnings are the highlight of the week ahead, with 180 S&P 500 companies expected to report quarterly financial results.

Wall Street is also awaiting any progress on trade deal negotiations.\n\nS&P 500 futures and Nasdaq 100 futures each declined 0.2%, while futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 56 points, or 0.1%.\n\nOn Monday, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent offered little clarity on the direction of reaching a possible trade agreement with China, but said that the onus was not on the United States.\n\n\"I believe that it's up to China to de-escalate, because they sell five times more to us than we sell to them, and so these 120%, 145% tariffs are unsustainable,\" Bessent said on CNBC's \"Squawk Box.\"\n\nHis comments come after President Donald Trump said last week that discussions with China were underway, refuting China's claims of no trade talks between the two countries.\n\nOn the positive side, however, Bessent said that they were making progress on other trade proposals, suggesting one with India would be \"one of the first\" to come. South Korea also hinted last week that trade talks were underway.\n\nInvestors are looking ahead to the busiest period of the first-quarter earnings season, which will see more than 180 S&P 500 companies report results. Four of the 'Magnificent Seven' companies\u2014 Amazon, Apple, Meta Platforms and Microsoft \u2014 will release their quarterly reports, as will financial, staples and health care stocks Visa, Coca-Cola, and Eli Lilly.\n\nEarnings results have been somewhat strong for the prior quarter, with 73% of companies reporting beating analysts' estimates so far \u2014 slightly below the 5-year average of 77%, according to FactSet data. Still, Wall Street is lowering expectations for the second quarter and the full year as companies come out with uncertain guidance because of President Donald Trump's tariffs.\n\nThis week will mark the end of April, which has seen stocks whipsaw across a wide trading range after Trump unveiled his sweeping tariff plans and then later walked some of the stiffer duties back.\n\nSo far in April, the S&P 500 is down by 1.5%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average is on track to lose 4.5% and the Nasdaq Composite is up 0.5%.

    "title": "Big Tech\u2019s Earnings Problem Is Estimates May Be Way Too High",
    "selftext": ">The last time Big Tech delivered earnings,\u00a0Donald Trump\u00a0had just started his term, stocks were soaring on expectations of a pro-growth government agenda and investors\u2019 main worry was how long it would take companies to convert their artificial intelligence spending into profits.\n\n>Three months later, they are facing a far bleaker picture.\n\n>This week\u2019s quarterly results from\u00a0Microsoft Corp.,\u00a0Apple Inc.,\u00a0Meta Platforms Inc.\u00a0and\u00a0Amazon.com Inc\u00a0will land in a market obsessed with every twist of a trade war that\u2019s wiped $5.5 trillion from the\u00a0S&P 500 Index. AI concerns have taken a back seat to angst over the possibility of a tariff-induced recession, while safe havens like gold have become the trade de jour for investors too rattled to buy stocks on the cheap.\n\n>Even with all the uncertainty, Wall Street isn\u2019t giving the companies\u2019 estimates much wiggle room. Analysts expect the so-called Magnificent Seven \u2014 which also includes Google-parent\u00a0Alphabet,\u00a0Tesla Inc.\u00a0and\u00a0Nvidia Corp.\u00a0\u2014 to deliver an average of 15% profit growth in 2025, a forecast that\u2019s barely budged since the start of March despite the flareup in trade tensions.\n\n>That raises the stakes for the four megacaps reporting this week, which collectively have a nearly 20% weighting in the S&P 500. Traders are unlikely to forgive earnings shortfalls in an already fearful market climate, despite steep declines in the stocks\u2019 share prices and improved valuations. Dire outlooks from the industry behemoths would also be poorly received, especially if they bolster\u00a0fears\u00a0of muted corporate spending ahead.\n\n>\u201cAny modicum of a weaker than expected number is going to cause a further selloff because of the concern around tariffs,\u201d said\u00a0Phil Blancato, chief market strategist at Osaic Wealth, who believes this year\u2019s weakness in megacaps is a buying opportunity.\n\n>Markets got an early read on how Big Tech might be faring last week. Tesla reported its\u00a0worst quarter\u00a0in years, though traders cheered signs that chief executive\u00a0Elon Musk\u00a0intends to step away from his government work and focus more on the electric-vehicle maker. Alphabet\u00a0beat expectations\u00a0but offered little future guidance. The Bloomberg Magnificent 7\u00a0index\u00a0jumped 9.1% last week amid a broader market rebound, though it\u2019s still down 15% in 2025.\n\n>A deeper look comes during a two-day stretch that starts with results from Meta and Microsoft on Wednesday. While many executives have declined to predict how tariffs might impact their bottom lines, Wall Street has been doing its own math. Based on a 22% tariff rate modeled by Bloomberg Economics, lower gross margins could result in a net income contraction of about 7% in 2025 for the S&P 500, compared with the current consensus estimate of nearly 12% growth,\u00a0wrote\u00a0Bloomberg Intelligence chief equity strategist\u00a0Gina Martin Adams.\n\n>Another key area of focus will be spending: The four biggest spenders \u2014 Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon and Meta \u2014 are projected to pour roughly $300 billion into capital expenditures in their current fiscal years. While the companies have pledged to maintain that pace in 2025, Microsoft\u2019s\u00a0sudden decision\u00a0to pause work on some data centers suggests cloud computing providers may be re-evaluating expenditures.\n\n>Apple, one of the companies most exposed to tariffs due to its supply chain reliance on China, may benefit from a pull-forward in demand from consumers seeking to avoid higher prices. However, those sales are seen as a one-off benefit, with tariffs sapping demand in future quarters.

    "title": "IBM beats Revenue & EPS, Outlook decent, stock down 6% AH over cancelled government consulting contracts overshadowing results",
    "selftext": "Link to the recap: [https://happybull.net/2025/04/23/ibm-ibm-software-shines-and-z17-looms-as-big-blue-navigates-shifting-tides/](https://happybull.net/2025/04/23/ibm-ibm-software-shines-and-z17-looms-as-big-blue-navigates-shifting-tides/)\n\nKey Notes:\n\n* During the Q1 2025 earnings call, management painted a picture of a company reaping the benefits of its strategic pivot towards hybrid cloud and AI. However, the initial after-hours stock reaction was notably negative, with shares dropping over 6%. News that several government consulting contracts were shelved appeared to overshadow the otherwise solid results and upbeat forecast, suggesting investors are weighing near-term headwinds\u2014particularly in consulting and perhaps the pace of Red Hat\u2019s growth\u2014against longer-term catalysts like the upcoming z17 mainframe launch. Despite the market\u2019s skepticism, the narrative from management focused on confident execution, leaning heavily on software momentum.\n* The clear standout in the quarter was IBM\u2019s Software segment, posting a solid 9% constant currency growth. This performance underscores the ongoing shift in IBM\u2019s revenue mix towards higher-growth, recurring revenue streams. CFO James Kavanaugh, during the call, emphasized this point, noting that software now constitutes about 45% of IBM\u2019s business, with roughly 80% of that being recurring. Strength was broad-based, with Automation up 15%, Data & AI climbing 7%, and Red Hat growing 13%.\n* CEO Arvind Krishna revealed during the Q1 call that IBM\u2019s generative AI book of business has swelled to over $6 billion since inception, adding over $1 billion in Q1 alone. Interestingly, about four-fifths of this is tied to Consulting engagements, helping clients strategize and deploy AI, with the remaining fifth coming from Software, including platforms like watsonx. Recent news reinforces this push, with IBM showcasing watsonx-powered features at events like the Masters Tournament, integrating Meta\u2019s Llama 4 models into [watsonx.ai](http://watsonx.ai), and expanding collaborations with partners like NVIDIA.\n* IBM Consulting delivered a flat year-over-year revenue performance in Q1, which marked a sequential improvement but appeared to be a key point of concern for investors, contributing significantly to the after-hours stock decline.\u00a0\n* The Infrastructure segment saw a 4% revenue decline in Q1, largely anticipated as IBM wrapped up the final quarter of its successful z16 mainframe cycle. The z16 program itself was highlighted on the call as the most successful in IBM\u2019s history.\n* Despite the macro crosscurrents and a skeptical initial market reaction fueled by the consulting contract news, IBM confidently reiterated its full-year guidance. The company targets revenue growth of 5%-plus at constant currency and free cash flow of approximately $13.5 billion. In a move explicitly aimed at bolstering investor confidence and providing clarity amidst the market uncertainty, IBM broke from its usual practice and issued specific Q2 revenue guidance. As Kavanaugh explained, \u201cWe\u2019ve chosen now, in light of the very unprecedented dynamic of uncertainty going on in the market, to give a second-quarter revenue guidance range\u2026 We felt incumbent upon ourselves to give as much transparency as possible.\u201d",

    "selftext": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/investing/american-exceptionalism-over/?ICID=continue_without_subscribing_reg_first\n\nNearly three quarters of fund managers think that US exceptionalism has peaked. The prevailing trend of the last decade \u2013 a belief in the continued success of US markets far beyond that of other regions \u2013 is over, according to the Bank of America\u2019s latest survey.\nOver the past two months, fund managers have dumped US equities at a record pace as President Trump\u2019s tariff war and uncertainty over global economic stability continue. For those watching closely, it should not come as a shock, although it has happened perhaps a little faster than anticipated.\n\nWhile it has come to feel like business as usual, US exceptionalism isn\u2019t the historic status quo. In the 1980s, for example, the rapid rise of Japanese stocks challenged the US dominance of global markets.\nTom Stevenson, investment director at Fidelity Personal Investing, explains that ultimately, the stock market bubble was over-inflated and had a long way to fall \u2013 a scenario today\u2019s US market is particularly vulnerable to.\nOne of the most notable pinpricks came at the start of this year with the release of DeepSeek, a sophisticated AI tool developed in China. The extremely cheap development cost of the model has sparked concerns that the AI moat of the American tech giants may not be as wide as had been assumed.\n\nSince 2012, average earnings from US stocks have risen 145pc \u2013 over the same period, European and UK markets have each seen earnings increase by just 37pc and 30pc, respectively.\n\nHugh Gimber, global market strategist at JP Morgan, says: \u201cTechnology has been the leading sector globally and the US has been overweight in that sector. In an environment where technology [stocks] have been standout it has been hard for other regions to out perform.\u201d\nHowever, the performance gap between the Magnificent Seven (Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Tesla, Meta and Nvidia) and the rest of the S&P 500 has narrowed of late. A year ago, the tech giants were outgrowing the rest of the US market by 30pc, a figure that has plummeted to just 6pc. That is expected to halve to just 3pc in 2026.\n\nThe upset is apparent in other metrics, too. While the Magnificent Seven accounted for 50pc of the S&P 500\u2019s earnings in 2024, this share is projected to fall to a third for 2025.\n\nAll of this adds up to a simple fact: US equities are unlikely to outperform the rest of the world to the extent that they have done in the recent past.\nIn fact, Mr Stevenson warns they may underperform.\nMarkets are also becoming suspicious of US government debt, which could have dramatic consequences for the stock market.\nMr Gimber explains: \u201cOne of the big parts behind the US economic outperformance is the size of the government deficit that has been running.\n\u201cThis has been an expansion built on US government debt, and although levels are still rising the market is getting wary of US government debt, especially in the context of inflationary pressure from tariffs.\u201d\n",

I am targeting potentially good candidates for short-term trading; I have no opinion on them as investments. The potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting, everything else is secondary.\n\nNews: [China Tells Airlines Stop Taking Boeing Jets As Trump Tariffs Expand Trade War](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-15/china-tells-airlines-stop-taking-boeing-jets-as-trump-tariffs-expand-trade-war)\n\n[**NVDA (Nvidia)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&p=d)\\- Nvidia announced it expects a $5.5B charge in Q1 2026 due to new U.S. export restrictions on its H20 AI chips to China. These chips were lobotomized versions initially designed to comply with earlier export controls but are now subject to stricter licensing requirements under the Trump administration's policies. I'm mainly interested if NVDA breaks $100 to the downside. The semis industry is volatile due to escalating U.S.-China trade tensions, affecting AMD and INTC (not as much) as well. Export policy volatility regarding semis exports will likely be in flux rather than having some kind of set policy and affect global AI chip demand. He who controls the spice controls the universe!!!!\n\n[**IBKR (Interactive Brokers)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=IBKR&p=d)\\- Reported Q1 adjusted EPS of $1.88 vs $1.92 expected. Revenue of $1.43B vs $1.42B expected. Despite the earnings miss, they announced a 28% dividend increase and a 4-for-1 stock split effective mid-July. Most of these brokerages have been selling off from the market peak around mid Feb, but I don't consider these to be interesting at the moment for outperformance, unless they fall further. Risks to watch out for in these include decreasing retail trading activity, fee compression, and competition from zero-commission platforms. (Also worth noting HOOD also fell from the Feb market peak)\n\n[**META (Meta)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=META&p=d)\\- Zuck testified in an FTC antitrust trial about Meta's acquisition of Instagram, with internal emails suggesting shady motives. The FTC alleges the moves were to neutralize competition and monopolize the social media space. We've had a significant selloff for the past 2 months from 750 to 500, and while not extremely liquid due to price/volume, it's still worth pursuing if there is some catalyst for a forced sale of Instagram (unlikely). Risks include potential breakup rulings (this is the white whale trade), broader regulatory clampdowns, and increased oversight of tech M&A (we've seen less M&A already this year in the Trump admin mainly due to volatility).\n\n[**ASML (Advanced Semiconductor Materials Lithography)-**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=ASML&p=d)  Reported Q1 net sales of \u20ac7.74B vs \u20ac7.8B expected, and net profit of \u20ac2.36B vs \u20ac2.3B expected. **Net bookings came in at \u20ac3.94B vs \u20ac4.89B expected, well below forecasts.** CEO flagged tariff-related uncertainty as a key risk to forward demand. Order shortfall is a bad sign (and also an explanation for why the rest of the semis fell as well). I typically don't trade super high priced stocks like this due to the spread but ultimately interested if we fall further to last week's levels (\\~$600).",

    "selftext": ">Sarah Wynn-Williams, Facebook\u2019s former Head of Global Public Policy, testified before the U.S. Senate today about the company\u2019s relationship with China.\n\n>According to Wynn-Williams, the company now known as Meta worked directly with the Chinese Community Party (CCP) to \u201cundermine U.S. national security and betray American values,\u201d she said.\n\n>She alleges that Facebook created custom-built censorship tools for the CCP, which gave a \u201cchief editor\u201d extensive power over content moderation to the point that they could choose to shut off service completely in certain regions of China or on certain dates, like the anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre.\n\n>Meta denied Wynn-Williams\u2019 allegations.\n\n>\u201cSarah Wynn-Williams\u2019 testimony is divorced from reality and riddled with false claims,\u201d said Ryan Daniels, a Meta spokesperson, in a statement to TechCrunch. \u201cWhile Mark Zuckerberg himself was public about our interest in offering our services in China and details were widely reported beginning over a decade ago, the fact is this: we do not operate our services in China today.\u201d\n\n>Wynn-Williams\u2019 testimony was highly anticipated. In March, she published a book about her time at Facebook called \u201cCareless People: A Cautionary Tale of Power, Greed, and Lost Idealism.\u201d\n\n>The day after the book was published, Meta won an\u00a0interim decision\u00a0from an arbitrator, which said that Wynn-Williams violated a non-disparagement clause that she signed when she left the company. But Meta\u2019s desire to limit the book\u2019s reach seems to have had the opposite effect \u2014 now, the book is\u00a0No. 2 on The New York Times Best Sellers list\u00a0under non-fiction.\n\n>Meta told TechCrunch that the arbitration order does not prohibit her from speaking to Congress and that the company does not intend to interfere with her legal rights. The company also said it\u2019s not a secret that it does business in China.\n\n>Toward the end of Wynn-Williams\u2019 tenure in 2017, Facebook had launched a photo-sharing app called Colorful Balloons in China, as well as an app called Moments. Meta points out that this has been\u00a0[previously reported](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/11/technology/facebook-china-moments-colorful-balloons.html)\u00a0and that it discloses in government filings that it generates advertising revenue from China, even though its services like Facebook and Instagram are banned there.\n\n>Per Meta\u2019s own 10-K\u00a0[filing](https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001326801/a8eb8302-b52c-4db5-964f-a2d796c05f4b.pdf), it made $18.3 billion in revenue for 2024, up from $13.69 billion and $7.4 billion in 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n\n>Wynn-Williams claims that Meta\u2019s relationship with the Chinese government runs deeper, though.\n\n>She shared documents with Congress, and Senator Josh Hawley (R-MO) showed some redacted versions of these documents in the hearing.\n\n>In one email, it appeared that Facebook executives had discussed granting the CCP access to user data from China and Hong Kong.\n\n>\u201cFacebook appears to have been willing to provide the data of users in Hong Kong to the Chinese government at a time when pro-democracy protesters were opposing Beijing\u2019s crackdown,\u201d Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) said, then asked Wynn-Williams if that is true. She said it is.\n\n>\u201cAs part of the censorship tool that was developed, there were virality counters \u2014 so any time a piece of content got over 10,000 views, that would automatically trigger it being reviewed by what they called the chief editor,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat was particularly surprising is that the virality counters were not just installed, but activated in Hong Kong and also in Taiwan.\u201d\n\n>Senator Blumenthal pointed out that Zuckerberg had previously denied under oath that Facebook had built censorship tools to enter the Chinese market.\n\n>Wynn-Williams added that if Meta were to share Chinese user data with the Chinese government, from a technological perspective, she doesn\u2019t think there would be a way to avoid sharing user data from Americans who had interacted with Chinese users.\n\n>She also claimed that Meta had briefed China on developments with various technologies like AI and facial recognition.\n\n>\u201cThe greatest trick Mark Zuckerberg ever pulled was wrapping the American flag around himself and calling himself a patriot, and saying he didn\u2019t offer services in China, while he spent the last decade building an 18 billion-dollar business there,\u201d Wynn-Williams said before the Senate.\n\n>\u201cAnd he continues to wrap the flag around himself as we move into the next era of artificial intelligence,\u201d she added.\n\nLink: [https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/09/whistleblower-sarah-wynn-williams-accuses-meta-of-colluding-with-china/](https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/09/whistleblower-sarah-wynn-williams-accuses-meta-of-colluding-with-china/)\n\n**Thoughts:** Overall pretty interesting whistleblower news on META and the business it does with China- it's unlikely this will lead to any significant regulatory/government action but considering that tensions with China are high, I think it's important to think about possible data breaches or security issues that other META's users face. This could also affect government contracts/AI expansion in the future they're gunning for.\n\nRight now META contracts with various government agencies for the use of its open-source model Llama, (and also works with the NSA). META also operates the Pacific Light Cable Network, a submarine cable system connecting the U.S. to Taiwan/Philippines.",

    "selftext": "[This was my post verbatim](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/s/S6dzbSZx1I), it was downvoted and criticized to oblivion. Never trust the Reddit mob.\n\n\n\u201cTariffs will be negotiated away. Buy as much stocks as possible!\n\nEveryone here is panicking and thinking these tariffs are going to destroy everything. It\u2019s not an incorrect thought\u2026 IF they stay in effect for a long period. \n\nHowever it\u2019s important to listen to what Trump has said. Trump said he\u2019s open to tarrif cuts if countries offer something phenomenal. He also said now these countries will be coming to us to negotiate rather than the other way around. He used tik tok as an example to say he may cut tarrif on china to close a tik tok deal. \n\nTrump put these tariffs in effect to give him huge leverage over every country. He even bragged that every country has called him to negotiate. Acting tough like the tariffs will be in place for a few years, is ONLY to increase their leverage. The more difficult it seems to remove tariffs the more negotiating power Trump has. \n\nThis is a rare stock crash where it\u2019s completely self inflicted with the signing of a pen from the president. This means to end this pain will ONLY take the president to end the tariffs- which can be done instantly. \n\nI am very sure this will be exactly like the Covid crash. He will keep talking a big talk and more and more terrible news will come out. But then there will be cracks as exceptions are made and deals are negotiated. This is literally the man who wrote \u201cArt of the Deal\u201d. He is 100% transactional and is always aiming to make a deal.\n\nPersonally I am buying AI stocks like crazy. This is probably the last chance to get on the AI boat before this stuff rockets. SMH, ASML, NVDA, AMZN META\u2014- all these big tech names will come out fine long term. No matter how scary it gets just keep buying. \u201c",

I figure I could buy a bit of Apple, NVidia, Meta, Google stuff like that that's generally pretty safe but is on sale, am I right about that, or the S&P500.\n\nSo a couple questions I have:\n\n1. What platform or app should I use to buy stocks, is robinhood good? Some of my friends use it, if not what to use\n\n2. Lets say I have 2k to invest should I do it separately over 2 weeks, or over 2 months, or $500 a week, or all at once?\n\n3. Is there any measure I need to take when buying a stock, do I just buy it and its there in the platform until the day I take it out?\n\n4. Best things to invest in, or from your experiance best thing to invest in? As I mentioned above those are kind of the stocks I figure id try and get a couple of\n\n5.

    "selftext": "So basically, I'm crunching numbers tonight to figure out my approach for the coming months.\n\nThe S&P 500 closed at 4,766 points on December 31, 2021. Today, it's at 5,075\u2014though we could be much lower by tomorrow night. That\u2019s a gain of just 6.46% over 3 years and 97 days.\n\nOn the inflation side:\n\n* In 2022, the US inflation rate peaked at 8.00%,\n* Then dropped to 4.12% in 2023,\n* And further eased to 2.9% in 2024.\n\n**SOFT LANDING**\u2026 I honestly miss hearing those two words.\n\nIf we compound those three numbers, the average American has lost about **15.7%** of their purchasing power.\n\nSo, if you bought the index in the last days of 2021, you\u2019d be roughly **-9%** in real terms today\u2014and probably worse off in the coming weeks or months.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see the index drop to 3,800 or even 3,500. But it simply *can\u2019t* go much lower. The earnings are solid, and inflation has inflated those earnings too. Many companies will maintain their value, especially since a lot of them generate revenue outside the US.\n\nThat said, the system will recover. Practically the entire world relies on US companies. Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, and Google are in homes across the globe\u2014billions of people use them daily for work or socializing. The same goes for manufacturers like CAT, Deere, KO, Pepsi, etc.\n\nWe\u2019ll be fine. The system will reset, and eventually, we\u2019ll return to profitability. Again, billions of people depend on a healthy US economy. Capitalism isn\u2019t collapsing anytime soon. So chill out\u2014and make sure you get your piece of the pie.",

Positions: Spy puts, short. \n\n[Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jckrcz/convince_me_i_shouldnt_be_a_bear_now_pt_2/) March 17. Positions: Cash + protectionist plays (INTC, X, etc). \n\nWell, this ended up becoming a little trilogy. The market has went down, a lot, and the big question is: \n\nIs this time to buy?\n\nI think so. I have been, over Thursday and Friday. \n\nWhy?\n\n1. Because these tariffs are bad. They are so bad that, if unchanged, they will cause not only a recession, but I think there will be riots on the streets within 6 months. \n\n2. Trump -- and the republican party -- are on a timer. Midterms are next year. They need to show results, not a crashing economy. Republicans are already starting to voice discontent. Ted Cruz *openly* stated this could be a \"political bloodbath\". If tariffs stay on, republicans will break ranks. Anything else is political suicide. \n\n3. This leads me to conclude that tariffs will be removed. Either via Trump or through congressional action. Maybe even impeachment. The result? Markets moon. \n\nThis leads me to 3 scenarios: \n\n1. Tariffs end quickly via renegotiation or Trump just backing down. I mean, islands with penguins? Seriously? Trump declares victory.\n\n2. Some tariffs (China) stay, many others are removed. Certain industries benefit, others feel pain.\n\n3. Tariffs stay on long enough to necessitate public/congressional intervention. Political chaos, recession, Maga goose cooked.\n\nIn scenario 1 and 2, damage is limited and markets ascend quickly. Remember, most gains come from certain days. \nIn scenario 3, damage includes a recession. Earnings go down and valuations may retreat to ~16, which is ~4400 on the S&P. We are at 5070 now.\n\nI'm deploying 80% of cash to buy. Keeping 20% safe, just in case.\n\nSo far, I've bought financials (KRE, WAL), tech (INTC, NVDA, META), retailers (NKE, RH) and SPY. Also, some LCID and RKLB for funsies. \n\nIs this the low? I don't know. China and the EU can wait Trump out, I think. Standing up to Trump and tariffs will be domestically popular for them. Which means they will not renegotiate. Which means action must come from the US. \n\nBut, sitting on cash for too long is foolish, unless you live in Omaha. Spy has already fallen from 613 in Feb when I went short; and from 560 in March when I went cash. Things are now a lot more attractive. \n\nTo summarize my theory, I hope that the adults in Washington step up, stop executive overreach, and we all benefit. It might take some time. I suggest writing to your representatives in Congress. I have.\n\nWhat do you guys think?",

He will keep talking a big talk and more and more terrible news will come out. But then there will be cracks as exceptions are made and deals are negotiated. This is literally the man who wrote \u201cArt of the Deal\u201d. He is 100% transactional and is always aiming to make a deal.\n\nPersonally I am buying AI stocks like crazy. This is probably the last chance to get on the AI boat before this stuff rockets. SMH, ASML, NVDA, AMZN META\u2014- all these big tech names will come out fine long term. No matter how scary it gets just keep buying. ",

The largest risk, according to analysts, centers on the iPhone maker's overseas production hubs, which are particularly vulnerable to the tariffed countries.\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump announced tariffs that will impact some 185 countries, including the United States's largest trading partners. Additional reciprocal tariffs, for instance, will include 34% tariffs on Chinese imports, a 20% tariff on European Union imports, a 46% tariff on imports from Vietnam, 32% on imports from Taiwan, and 26% on India \u2014 all set to take effect on April 9.\n\nNotably, the additional 34% tax on China will be added to the country's existing 20% tariff, meaning its total tariff rate will rise to 54%. China is Apple's most important\u00a0[production hub](https://www.businessinsider.com/tim-cook-apple-supply-chain-trump-tariffs-china-diversify-iphone-2025-1?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=yahoo.com), with about 85% of its iPhones manufactured there.\n\n\"Apple produces basically all their iPhones in China, and the question will be around exceptions and exemptions on this tariff policy if those companies are building more operations, factories, and plants in the US[\u00a0like Apple announced in February](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/02/apple-will-spend-more-than-500-billion-usd-in-the-us-over-the-next-four-years/),\" Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said in a note to clients following the announcement.\n\nAs trade tensions escalate, Apple has moved to increase its supply chain beyond just China, boosting manufacturing in places like India and Vietnam. But with the new tariff announcements set to impact those countries too, there's now limited room for reprieve.\n\n\"The worry will be around pricing and margin impacts along with what this means for the global supply chain looking forward,\" Ives said. For now, the analyst continues to believe major negotiations will happen over the coming months as companies attempt to navigate \"this new world of tariffs.\"\n\nUntil then, he warned, \"tech stocks will clearly be under major pressure.\"\n\nOther Magnificent Seven players also faced significant selling action. In aggregate, that cohort of stocks is currently on track to eliminate over $800 billion from their collective market caps.\n\nIn afternoon trade, Amazon ([AMZN](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMZN)) and Nvidia ([NVDA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NVDA)) each fell 7%, followed by a 6% drop in both Alphabet ([GOOGL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOGL)) and Tesla ([TSLA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA)). Meta ([META](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/META)) dipped 3%, while Microsoft ([MSFT](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MSFT)) was off just under 2%.\n\nOutside of the Mag Seven, chip stocks faced similar declines, despite the exemption of semiconductors from Trump's additional tariffs. Nvidia competitor Broadcom ([AVGO](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AVGO)), for example, erased well over $50 billion from its market cap following an 8% drop in shares.\n\n\"The implications \\[of the announced tariffs\\] are broad-reaching, and we see negative implications for the whole \\[chip\\] sector,\" KeyBanc analyst John Vinh wrote in a note to clients. \"These are most notably going to negatively impact end-demand in key markets including smartphones/iPhones and PCs, as a significant amount of manufacturing is done within China.\"\n\nStacy Rasgon, Bernstein's managing director and senior analyst, added in an interview with Yahoo Finance that the biggest headwind for semiconductors is not necessarily the direct impact of tariffs. Rather, it's the risk of demand destruction as these products become more expensive.\n\nHe added, \"The other risk for semis is that they are very cyclical, very global, and very correlated to the macro and to GDP.\u00a0[So if this tips us into recession,\u00a0](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/us-economy-dangerously-vulnerable-to-recession-wall-street-reacts-to-tariff-fallout-155837444.html)that's probably not going to be great.\"",

A sign of escalation and a warning, China is essentially responding in kind that it will give tariffs back (just like 2018). Reduced Chinese investment could result in less liquidity in the markets overall and larger volatility. If you want to see a reminder of how Chinese stocks performed when we got into a trade war, look at 2018-2019. We haven't a seen a meaningful move in these stocks yet, but if there are responses from China in kind to the tariff announcement today, things are going to get volatile,\n\n[**SPY (S&P 500 ETF)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SPY&p=d), [**QQQ (Invesco QQQ)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=QQQ&p=d), VXX, etc. - President Trump is set to unveil new tariffs today but is still finalizing details. Options include a tiered system (10%-20%) or a flat 20% global tariff. We're likely going to see a LOT of incremental headlines today on this until Trump speaks in the Rose Garden; I'll be watching what he says on the websites he posts on, and going for the speed trade on this. He is expected to talk at 4PM Eastern. Obviously, a lot of volatility and uncertainty due to no one knowing what exactly the tariff plans are going to be. The imposition of new tariffs could escalate trade tensions, leading to retaliatory measures from affected countries (which we don't know the extent of how many are affected) and impacting global economic growth.\n\n[**TSLA (Tesla)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TSLA&p=d)\\- Tesla reported preliminary March China deliveries of 78.8K vehicles vs 89.1K YoY. The company has delivered 336,681 cars in the first quarter, far fewer than the 390,000 expected. The decline in Tesla's China deliveries was a bit of a signal that the global sales would be bad, but frankly this wasn't as terrible as I expected. Currently short, will cover if we break $260 to the upside. Also interested in the $250 level. You guys know the risks by now (BYD and competitors, Musk, politics, etc).\n\n[**META**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=META&p=d), [**SNAP**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SNAP&p=d), [**GOOG**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=GOOG&p=d) \\- The April 5th deadline for TikTok to be sold off or face a ban is approaching, potentially leading to incremental headlines today in addition to tariff news. No real move in these stocks yet but I expect any news headline that is negative for TikTok to be great for the companies I'm watching (social media rivals). A ban on TikTok could alter the membership for the social media sites mentioned (they have to go somewhere). Since this is a weekend headline, I'm thinking of buying more GOOG- if TikTok DOES get banned, then these companies will likely gain. Otherwise, business continues as usual and they don't benefit. .",

    "title": "CoreWeave, the biggest IPO of 2025. (DD on $CRWV)",
    "selftext": "# I love IPOs.\n\nThe last IPO I thought was amazing was ARM (and how far we've come!).  Coreweave (IPOing on the 28th!) is another one I think has a ton of potential. (I wrote the majority of this before the reduced IPO sizing so please forgive me if my math is incorrect).\n\nCoreWeave is a cloud infrastructure provider specializing in GPU computing, called an \u201cAI hyperscaler.\u201d They run data centers full of GPUs and rent out that computing power to customers via the cloud. Similar to AWS/Azure, but they're focused on AI/ML/GPU tasks like making stupid Studio Ghibli pictures of yourself.\n\nCRWV started in 2017 mining ETH but pivoted to being a GPU farm in 2019 after the crash. By 2022, they fully exited crypto mining and doubled down on enterprise GPU cloud services\u200b. This early mover advantage in GPU hosting, (along with all the GPUs they bought from NVDA), have made it a player in the the cloud services space.\n\nCRWV makes money by charging for usage-based cloud compute - clients pay for GPU hours on their servers.\u200b Initially, they served niches like VFX studios (movies like Interstellar take millions of GPU hours to render), but now AI training and inference workloads are the main growth driver\u200b.\n\nCompanies like META/IBM/MSFT have used CRWV for AI compute needs in the past\u200b. CRWV's differentiator is through software- they claim custom scheduling software (e.g. a system called \u201cSUNK\u201d and an optimizer \u201cTensorizer\u201d) that yields better hardware utilization, faster container spin-ups, and higher throughput than general-purpose which makes them more efficient to use.\n\nIn practice, that means a customer training a large ML model might get results faster or cheaper on CRWV than on AWS. CRWV currently operates 32 data centers with 250k+ NVDA GPUs and are very aggressive in acquiring them- they deploy A100, H100, and H200s and are prioritized as customers of NVDA.\n\n**The NVDA Relationship**\n\nNVDA backs CRWV, and they're strong partners (which means they prioritize each other over other customers). Due to this, I dismiss the possibility that CRWV will ever have troubles on the supply side of obtaining GPUs. Something that is fairly common knowledge is that NVDA (and other companies) prefer selling GPUs in bulk because it simplifies customer service and they can charge for enterprise support and  sell thousands at a time. It's also why NVDA spits on the face of their gaming customers.\n\n**Isn't it kind of shady that NVDA both invests and is a customer of CRWV? Why doesn't NVDA use their own chips instead of renting capacity from CRWV?**\n\nKind of. Nothing they've done is outright illegal (even using their GPUs as collateral is within the law). Even companies that build GPUs need to rent compute when there's a massive amount of demand. MSFT did it, NVDA did it, OpenAI WILL do it. CRWV signed a direct deal with OpenAI: a multi-year commitment up to $11.9\u202fB for GPU cloud capacity\u200b. They have ties to the major AI players. This entire DD going forward assumes that they will continue to keep their relationship with NVDA because NVDA needs them so AWS doesn't swallow the entire market. \n\n**The Financials**\n\nCRWV has had ridiculous growth- In 2022, they had revenue of $15.8\u202fM (the majority of which came from ETH mining). In 2023, their GPU computing pivot led to revenue of $229M, then $1.9B in 2024. This was obviously fueled by the release of ChatGPT as demand for GPU compute exploded as other companies scrambled to compete with their OWN LLM models.\n\nBy 2024, CRWV neared $2\u202fB in annual sales, transforming from a niche player to a major cloud provider in two years.\n\nThe financial issue is that CRWV is unprofitable as it scales. In 2023, it lost \\~$600M, and in 2024m \\~$860M. For every $1 of revenue in 2024, they spent about $1.45 for huge investments in data centers, GPUs, and the associated operating costs (plus interest on debt they've taken out which they have a ton of).\n\nThe S-1 shows operating costs close to \\~$1B from tech/infra in 2024, which includes data center space, buying/depreciating their GPUs, electricity costs, maintenance staff, etc. The capex is massive and is funded largely by debt.\n\nThe cash burn is brutal as well- at the end of 2024 CRWV still has negative FCF (which is normal for a pre-ipo high growth tech startup) and is betting that they will eventually claw their way to profitability despite the brutal looking financials (like Uber, Snowflake, Robinhood, insert your choice of tech startup here lol). The bet is that high upfront investment now will secure long-term contracts and scale to profitability later, like most tech IPOs.\n\n**Customer Concentration**\n\nIn 2023, Microsoft accounted for \\~35% of CRWV\u2019s revenue\u200b. In 2024, that grew to \\~62% of total revenue\u200b. Their S-1 mentioned that close to \\~80% of their revenue comes from two customers alone. But this is a warning sign because MSFT wants to build their own (hence their announcement of spending \\~$80B in 2025 for AI data centers).\n\n**If MSFT scales back their use of CRWV then they are frankly fucked.** MSFT's CEO also mentioned that using external capacity (like CRWV) for GPUs was a short-term stopgap until their own investment in Azure pays off.\n\nHowever, the OpenAI deal (remember that OpenAI is 49% owned by MSFT) could take the place of MSFT going forward. The contract is up to $11.9B through 2030\u200b, which averages out to \\~$2B/year if used, which is equivalent to all of CRWV's 2024 revenue.  If OpenAI maximizes their usage, CRWV\u2019s revenue could potentially double at minimum if MSFT doesn't pull out. This is a wild hopium optimistic case but I thought it was worth mentioning.\n\nBeyond those two, CRWV has other customers that make up the \\~20% of 2024 revenue). These include research labs, VFX studios, and other tech companies but none are individually as large compared to the MSFT/OpenAI. What will make or break this company in the long run is the diversification of the client base because all their eggs are in one basket.\n\n**IPO Technicals**\n\nCRWV sold 37.5M shares at $40/share, getting $1.5B and giving it a $20B valuation. That was below CRWV's official target of offering 49M shares at $47-$55, raising up to $2.7B at $32B valuation\u200b. This signals a lack of interest in the initial offering and is not great news if you already hold the stock, but is excellent if you're a short term trader that wants to see a pop on IPO day- the stock has more room to run. Yes, this means it's good for retail, bad for insiders.\n\n**Valuation/Comparables**\n\nIs a \\~$20B valuation reasonable for CRWV? You can do a rough comparison:\n\n|**Company**|Annual Revenue (2024)|**Recent Valuation**|**EV/Revenue Multiple**|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|**CoreWeave** (CRWV)|$1.92\u202fB|\\~$20B (target IPO)|\\~10\u00d7|\n|**Snowflake** (SNOW)|$3.41\u202fB\u200b|\\~$52\u202fB (market cap)|\\~15\u00d7 \u200b|\n|**Databricks**\\*|\\~$3\u202fB by end of 2025|\\~$62\u202fB \u200b|\\~20\u00d7|\n|**AWS** (AMZN)|$107.6\u202fB\u200b|\\~$500\u202fB|\\~4-5\u00d7|\n\n(That's not a typo- AWS is valued at \\~$500B, it's the main driver of AMZN's growth, yet struggles to grow because it's already massive). \\*Also note that Databricks is a private company\n\nI think that if the company can maintain a hyper-growth trajectory (e.g. 2-3\u00d7 growth for a couple more years), then an 10\u00d7 multiple now could look cheap in hindsight. For instance, 2025 revenue could hit \\~$4\u202fB+ with the OpenAI ramp and other clients. Of course, we have risks like growth decelerating, and tariffs and Trump and China that could come in and decimate growth. And of course, they're not profitable (for now). Ironically, CRWV and other US firms would BENEFIT from chip restrictions because they'd be prioritized over the overseas ones that use NVDA chips.\n\nCRWV\u2019s valuation is aggressive (dare I say fair for a hyperscaler), but in line  with other cloud providers. The entire short term bull thesis depends on them retaining MSFT as a customer and also keeping OpenAI- if that occurs then investing in it now looks like a no-brainer. If not, **it's completely possible we see an 50%+ selloff. I think that's the reason why we're seeing such hesitancy in this valuation.**\n\nThis valuation is also dependent on entirely dependent on AI spending GROWING, society seeing greater integration in AI (more than we have now), and AI firms willing to continue spending on compute they can't harness themselves. We are still supply constrained on GPUs in general, and if we ever experience NVDA building more GPUs than there is demand for, then Coreweave's margins are threatened and profitability can vanish. For now, it looks like that is unlikely to happen.\n\n**IPO Trading Details**\n\n37.5M shares is decent IPO volume so I don't expect this to be illiquid when it trades. The main things I watch for are indication price (whether there are people who want to buy the print of the stock higher than what we IPO at) and share paired (which somewhat signal when the IPO will open for trading).\n\nOverall, this is a pure AI play on GPU compute, a bet that demand for GPUs will continue to outstrip supply,  and that MSFT/OpenAI/every other tech firm involved won't slit their throat in in the eternal game of thrones that is capitalism.\n\n**TL;DR:** There's a hell of a lot of risk, but I like the stock. It's completely possible it could open and sell off because the insiders just want to bail. It's possible that it skyrockets. Anything is possible in the wild and crazy world of IPO trading.\n\nSource:\n\n[Majority of it came from S-1 on the SEC site](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1769628/000119312525044231/d899798ds1.htm), the rest from other random tech sites and background knowledge of cloud hyperscalers.",

    "selftext": "Meta has staged one of the most remarkable comebacks in tech history. After being written off in 2022 amid Apple\u2019s privacy changes, TikTok competition, and an uncertain metaverse pivot, the company has bounced back stronger than ever. Its ad engine is running hot again, user engagement is rising, and it's making massive AI infrastructure investments to future-proof the business. With durable moats, expanding monetization surfaces, and strong financial discipline, Meta is no longer just a recovery story \u2014 it\u2019s a mature compounding machine with clear upside potential from here.\n\n* **Financial resurgence:** $164.5B revenue (+22% YoY), $62.3B net income (+59%), 42% operating margin, and $52.1B in free cash flow in 2024. ROE stood at \\~34%, showcasing strong capital efficiency at scale.\n* **Durable moats:** Meta\u2019s 4B+ user base powers an unmatched data advantage. Its AI feedback loop, social graph, multi-surface presence (Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp), and cross-app identity infrastructure create high switching costs and network effects that competitors can't replicate.\n* **AI infrastructure bet:** Meta is investing $60\u201365B in 2025 to scale its AI infrastructure \u2014 including custom silicon (MTIA chips), Llama foundation models, and massive inference-optimized data centers. These are mostly fixed costs, setting up future operating leverage as growth Capex tapers.\n* **Next leg of growth:**\n   1. **Messaging monetization** \u2014 Click-to-Message ads, in-chat commerce, and AI agents on WhatsApp and Instagram\n   2. **AI-driven ads** \u2014 Automated campaign creation (Advantage+), performance boosts for SMBs and creators\n   3. **AR/VR optionality** \u2014 Quest 3, smart glasses, and a path toward mass-market AR by 2027. This is more of optionality now. If this works out, can create significant additional revenue. \n\n* **Valuation (Base Case):** EPS grows to \\~$44 by 2029 with steady 10\u201311% top-line growth. At a 20x multiple, the stock could reach \\~$875 \u2192 **\\~6.9% CAGR from today**.\n* **Valuation (Bull Case):** If WhatsApp hits $20B+ revenue and AI tools gain traction, EPS could hit $50 by 2030. At 25x multiple \u2192 **$1,250 stock (\\~12.6% CAGR)**.\n\n  \nIn summary, Meta has transformed from a struggling giant in 2022 to a cash-generating, AI-powered compounding machine in 2025. With $62B in profit, 4B users, deep data moats, and massive AI infrastructure bets, it\u2019s positioned for steady, long-term growth across ads and messaging with the Reality Labs optionality. ",

    "selftext": "\nMajor indexes closed slightly higher Tuesday as the stock market continued its recovery from an extended selloff.\n\nThe S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite added 0.2% and 0.5%, respectively, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose fractionally. Stocks had kicked off the week with big gains following news that President Trump could scale back some of the tariffs that are due to be imposed next week on U.S. trading partners. With the recent gains, the Dow has inched back into positive territory for 2025, as stocks have rebounded from a month-long selloff spurred by concerns about the potential impact of tariffs and uncertainty about the outlook for the economy.\n\nInvestors brushed off consumer confidence data released this morning that came in weaker than expected, with the index hitting its lowest level in more than four years. Investors are closing watching all data points amid worries that tariffs could reignite inflation and cause economic growth to stall. The big economic report of the week comes Friday with the scheduled release of the Federal Reserve's preferred measure of inflation.\n\nThe yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which had fallen during the recent stock market rout amid the growing concerns about the economy, was at 4.32% in late trading, down from 4.33% at yesterday's close and from an earlier high Tuesday of 4.37%. The yield, which affects costs on all sorts of loans, notably mortgages, hit its highest level in more than a month this morning.\n\nMega-cap technology stocks, which helped lead Monday's rally, were mostly higher again today. Shares of Tesla (TSLA) rallied late in the day to finish 3.5% higher, gaining ground for the 5th consecutive session, despite news Tuesday that the EV maker's sales in Europe continued to slide. Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN) and Meta Platforms (META) each rose more than 1%, while Microsoft (MSFT) inched ahead. Chipmakers Nvidia (NVDA) and Broadcom (AVGO) closed slightly lower\n\n\n\nhttps://www.investopedia.com/dow-jones-today-03252025-11702763",

    "selftext": "Short sellers have been cleaning up to start 2025 amid a massive sell-off in some of the market's most popular names over the past two years.\n\nShort sellers have made a combined $15 billion betting against Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA) stock thus far this year, according to data from S3 Partners. Tesla shorts alone have raked in nearly $11 billion, while bets against Nvidia have brought in more than $4 billion.\n\nTesla's 40% year-to-date drop has led the declines of the so-called Magnificent Seven stocks. Investors have grown concerned about CEO Elon Musk's focus on government efficiency efforts and how his role with President Trump's administration could be a turnoff to the electric vehicle maker's customer base.\n\nBut it hasn't just been Tesla lagging. As an index, the Magnificent Seven \u2014 which also includes Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), and Meta (META) \u2014 is underperforming the S&P 500 this quarter by the most since 2022.\n\nShort sellers have profited off of all of the names in the cohort this year. They've brought in nearly $5 billion betting against Apple stock, which is down nearly 14% in 2025.\n\nThe crash in the most popular trade of the past two years comes as investors have been re-rating their growth expectations. Fears of slowing economic growth and the impact of Trump's tariff policies have weighed on markets. Meanwhile, Big Tech has faced growing investor criticism about its ballooning AI spend and whether or not it will eventually boost future profits as much as Wall Street hopes. The year also included a massive drawdown in some large tech names, including Nvidia, following the release of a cheaper AI model from Chinese company DeepSeek.\n\nNow, with most of the names sitting around 20% off their recent 52-week highs, the looming question for markets is whether or not investor appetite for the stocks that led the market higher for the past two years will return.\n\n\"Maybe these tech stocks got ahead of their skis a little bit,\" BMO Capital Markets chief investment strategist Brian Belski told Yahoo Finance last week. \"But at the end of the day, these are monster companies that define the growth trajectory for the United States stock market.

    "title": "Why $RDDT Is A Must Have Stock",
    "selftext": "Reddit is one of the premier social media apps out there with a cheap valuation (never judge a growth stock by P/E) for its growth trajectory.\n\nLet's start with the fundamentals:\n\n1. 2024 YE it had a 90.5% gross profit percentage, revenue grew by 62% (NVIDIA like growth??) and it became FCF positive. Next quarter revenue will be growing at 50% to ultimately end at 40% YoY based on guidance. I've been following $RDDT for quite some time and there is always a beat on revenue AND guidance versus what they expected so you can say there is a little bit of conservatism in this numbers.\n2. From a balance sheet perspective it only has $26.7mm of debt. This company generated $215mm in FCF this year and is forecast to double to $520mm by next year. Capex spend is only 2% of its revenue. This companies management loves to run things efficiently and as cheaply as possible. On going concern is not an issue.\n3. The company is already EPS positive and will turn EPS positive on a YoY basis by 2025 YE. If you look at it from a PEG perspective, it is trading at 0.74 for 2026. Anything below 1 is cheap. The only reason you see negative EPS is because the company has been expensing stock based compensation (US GAAP) requirement each quarter. This has ended in 2024, that is why you see major acceleration in EPS growth QoQ moving forward.\n4. Share dilution is very minimal. A lot of growth companies like to pay employees in stock to attract talent, but that is not what reddit does. Diluated shares outstanding actually fell 1% in QoQ. This is great for any share holder.\n5. Reddit data is a gold mine. Google pays Reddit $66mm a year for data licensing. This has 85% operating margin - so you need to remember Reddits profitability isn't going away anytime soon because you are starting from a high point.\n6. Insider trading has popped up this weekend after the crazy drop. That is a significant buy signal.\n7. From a multiple standpoint, price to sales, revenue etc it has gotten cheaper despite the stock increasing in value. Reddit user growth has exploded over time, with 50% international base and is becoming a hit globally. Reddit's top 15 advertisers spent 50% more YoY and international ad revenue grew by 77%.\n\n\\- THIS IS IMPORTANT. If US were to go slow down, the international piece provides a buffer on revenue for the company.\n\n8) Advertising approach is incredibly unique. Reddit offers companies the ability to have AMAs to offer product information. I've personally seen this in my time using this reddit. Each subreddit is highly specialized which makes advertising that much easier. People pay Meta and Google top dollar because they are able to use statistical AI inference to generate ad campaigns well. Reddit doesn't need that. If you sell bikes, there's a laundry list of bike subreddits you can target. This is the future as Ad targeting improves on Reddit.\n\nDownside / Bear bases:\n\n1. Highly dependent on Google search. Google search was the reason that Reddit fell after earnings because of the average daily user count fell. Management has said this happens often in its existence and they worked quickly to get back on top of user searches. Management was largely dismissive of this because of their experience and noted higher levels of people asking questions and typing reddit at the end into google.\n2. AI Capex slows down. This will erode profitability on the company, but given how \"clean\" reddit data is, this is the least of my concerns.\n3. Execution and ad platform growth. Growing is expensive, and if Reddit adopts a spend what you can to get it done it will have investors fearful. Based on their CFO's commentary this is not very likely because how they approach things and history shows.\n4. User growth slows down. This is highly possible, but I do believe the international side of things will be a buffer on user growth.\n\nHaving said all of this, my PT is $250 for the company. This is an absolute long term hold.\n\nAny dips should be bought and even though Reddit looks expensive at face value, it really isn't. It trades at 50x forward earnings with 50% YoY growth and a net profitability that will approach 30+%. People are paying almost triple for Palantir and other software stocks out there.",

    "selftext": ">The US\u00a0Federal Trade Commission\u00a0is moving ahead with a sprawling antitrust probe of\u00a0Microsoft Corp.\u00a0that was opened in the waning days of the Biden Administration, signaling that Donald Trump\u2019s new FTC Chair\u00a0Andrew Ferguson\u00a0is going to prioritize scrutiny of tech giants.\n\n>FTC staff in recent weeks have continued to work on the investigation, meeting with companies and other groups to gather information, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be named discussing a confidential investigation.\n\n>The FTC sent Microsoft a so-called civil investigative demand, which is similar to a subpoena, late last year. The document, a copy of which was viewed by Bloomberg, compels the company to turn over reams of data about its AI operations, including the cost to train models and obtain data, going as far back as 2016. The agency sought details about Microsoft\u2019s data centers, its struggles to find enough computing power to meet customer demand and the company\u2019s software licensing practices.\n\n>The FTC is also scrutinizing Microsoft\u2019s decision to slash funding on its own artificial intelligence projects after striking a deal with OpenAI, which could be perceived as hurting competition in the burgeoning AI market.\n\n>One company has heard regularly from the FTC on the issue of Microsoft\u2019s licensing practices since the investigative demand was sent, said one of the people. The FTC and lawyers for that company have discussed what information the agency could ask for in a more comprehensive, formal request. The company also received a shorter list of questions several weeks ago asking for documents the company provided to other regulators. The FTC is further seeking information about licensing rule changes Microsoft said will go into effect later this year, the person said.\n\n>The agency said in the information demand that it wants to determine whether Microsoft\u2019s profits from other parts of the business give it an edge over other AI companies. The agency also said it wants details about Microsoft\u2019s data center capacity constraints to better understand the costs behind cloud-computing services. Those details will help the agency determine whether to bring a case.\n\n>Since receiving the FTC demand, Microsoft may have sought to narrow the scope of the information it\u2019s being asked to turn over \u2014 a typical move by companies being probed by the agency. Such wide-ranging antitrust investigations can take years and don\u2019t always result in the agency bringing a case.\n\n>\u201cWe are working cooperatively with the agency,\u201d said Alex Haurek, a Microsoft spokesman. The FTC didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.\n\n>The evolution of the probe now rests in the hands of Ferguson and his new head of competition,\u00a0Daniel Guarnera, who joined the agency from the Justice Department, where he worked on antitrust cases targeting\u00a0Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google and\u00a0Apple Inc.\n\n>In his\u00a0first public remarks\u00a0since taking the chair position in late February, Ferguson said investigating the tech sector is his highest priority. Early moves include seeking information on censorship by tech companies.\n\n>Ferguson also backed a filing in January in support of billionaire\u00a0Elon Musk, who\u00a0sued to derail OpenAI\u2019s plans\u00a0to restructure as a more conventional for-profit business.\n\n>The civil investigative demand was crafted by FTC staff and personally signed off on by former Chair\u00a0Lina Khan\u00a0after the agency spent more than a year conducting informal interviews with Microsoft competitors and business partners, Bloomberg previously reported.\n\n>Ferguson\u2019s FTC has inherited several other cases against big tech companies from Khan, including lawsuits against\u00a0Meta Platforms Inc.\u00a0and\u00a0[Amazon](http://Amazon.com) Inc.\u00a0On Wednesday, the agency asked a judge to delay a trial challenging Amazon\u2019s Prime subscription practices, citing resource constraints at the agency. The FTC quickly walked back comments that resource constraints at the agency will hamper its ability to start a trial in September.\n\n>Most of the questions in the information demand relate to how Microsoft licenses its software products, particularly as it relates to the company\u2019s cloud-computing business. Competitors have complained that Microsoft\u2019s licensing terms and bundling of both its popular office productivity and security software with its cloud offerings makes it harder for them to compete.\n\n>About a third of the questions focus on Microsoft\u2019s AI business, highlighting the importance of the burgeoning technology to the company\u2019s future. Underlying the FTC\u2019s requests are concerns that Microsoft canceled some of its own work after deciding to invest in deciding to invest in OpenAI and learning heavily on its GPT software, eliminating potential competition.\n\n>Despite the hefty sum, Microsoft didn\u2019t disclose its investment to competition regulators ahead of time, and the\u00a0FTC also has been investigating\u00a0whether the deal was structured as a partnership to avoid a merger investigation, Bloomberg has reported.\n\n>When Microsoft first invested in OpenAI in 2019, the startup was a promising research lab looking for a way to fund the cloud-computing power required to create AI models. Microsoft started with a $1 billion infusion after co-founder Musk withdrew his backing. Microsoft had been working on various AI projects of its own for more than two decades and\u00a0feared it was falling behind\u00a0rival Google.\n\n>The company\u2019s efforts were scattered across several divisions and not producing the results Chief Executive Officer\u00a0Satya Nadella\u00a0had hoped for. In 2023, one month after pumping an additional $10 billion into OpenAI, Microsoft began unveiling a series of products infused with OpenAI technology.

Climate Change Conference. Financial institutions including Bank of America, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley backed the pledge last year.\n\n\nThe pledge is nonbinding, but highlights the growing support for expanding nuclear power among leading industries, finance and governments.\n\nAmazon, Google and Meta are increasingly important drivers of energy demand in the U.S. as they build out artificial intelligence centers. The tech sector is turning to nuclear power after concluding that renewables alone won\u2019t provide enough reliable power for their energy needs.\n\nAmazon and Google announced investments last October to help launch small nuclear reactors, technology still under development that the industry hopes will reduce the cost and timelines that have plagued new reactor builds in the U.S.\n\nMeta issued a call in December for nuclear developers to submit proposals to help the tech company add up to four gigawatts of new nuclear in the U.S.\n\nThe pledge signed Wednesday was led by the World Nuclear Association on the sidelines of the CERAWeek by S&P Global energy conference in Houston.",

    "selftext": "It\u2019s gone from bad to worse for tech investors.\n\nWith the Nasdaq suffering its steepest drop since 2022 on Monday, the seven most valuable tech companies lost more than $750 billion in market value. Recession fears and concerns about a trade war drove the selloff.\n\nApple\u00a0led the megacap losses, with its value plummeting by about $174 billion.\u00a0Nvidia\u00a0shaved off almost $140 billion in market value and shares closed down 5%. The leading AI chipmaker has lost nearly a third of its value just two months after notching a fresh high in January.\n\nTesla\u00a0had the biggest percentage loss, with shares of the electric vehicle maker tumbling 15%, their worst day since 2020. The company has lost more than half its value since its stock price peaked in mid-December**.**\u00a0The stock is also coming off its\u00a0longest weekly losing streak in history\u00a0as a public company.\n\nTesla lost $130 billion in value on Monday, while\u00a0Microsoft\u00a0and\u00a0Alphabet\u00a0lost $98 billion and $95 billion, respectively.\u00a0Amazon\u00a0lost $50 billion and Meta lost $70 billion.\n\nAlphabet\u00a0and\u00a0Meta\u00a0dropped more than 4% on Monday, while\u00a0Microsoft\u00a0and\u00a0Amazon\u00a0dropped at least 2% each. The\u00a0Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund\u00a0fell more than 4%, entering correction territory. Shares are more than 14% off their high.\n\nHeavy selling intensified across the tech, with the Nasdaq falling to a six-month low. Many tech companies rely on parts and manufacturing overseas and new levies could push up prices. That\u2019s also sparked worries of a U.S. recession, which\u00a0Trump didn\u2019t rule out\u00a0over the weekend.\n\nSemiconductor makers have also felt the pain, with the sector a primary target of new tariffs.

Shares of German firm Siemens Energy\u00a0[(ENR1n.DE), opens new tab](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/ENR1n.DE)\u00a0and French company Schneider Electric\u00a0[(SCHN.PA), opens new tab](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/SCHN.PA)\u00a0fell 7% and 4%, respectively.U.S. utility companies Constellation Energy\u00a0[(CEG.O), opens new tab](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/CEG.O)\u00a0and Vistra\u00a0[(VST.N), opens new tab](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/VST.N), which provide power for data centers, lost 5.9% and 5.1%, respectively. Tech bellwethers were lower as part of a broader Nasdaq selloff.Investor skepticism over the billions that U.S. tech firms have channeled into AI infrastructure has grown due to slow payoffs and breakthroughs at Chinese startup DeepSeek, which showcased AI tech at a much lower cost than its Western [rivals.Microsoft](http://rivals.Microsoft) had also paused converting statement of qualifications, or precursors to formal leases, TD Cowen analysts said, adding that other tech firms including Meta Platforms\u00a0[(META.O), opens new tab](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/META.O)\u00a0had previously made similar moves to lower capital spending.\"I don't construe it as any change up in the big macro picture. \n\nTheir desire is to build out these data centers,\" said Dan Morgan, senior portfolio manager at Synovus Trust, which owns shares in Microsoft.Any lease cancellations would mark a sharp shift for Microsoft, which has been spending billions of dollars on data centers to overcome supply bottlenecks that have limited its ability to meet AI demand.The news could possibly indicate lower demand, Bernstein analyst Mark Moelder said, especially after lackluster quarterly results from major cloud companies, but it was also reflective of the capacity build-up at Microsoft in the past years.\"Microsoft needed to meet demand and had a great deal of difficulty finding capacity. Management may, therefore, have rented, even at a meaningful premium, data centers and GPU capacity and negotiated more deals for additional future capacity than they needed,\" Moelder added.\n\n  \n",

Crazy how I miss a few days and that's when everything is going nuts lol.\n\nNews: [Trump Administration Seeks More Restrictions On China Tech Weighs Nvidia Curbs](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-25/trump-administration-seeks-more-restrictions-on-china-tech-weighs-nvidia-curbs)\n\n**Ticker:** [**SMH**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SMH&p=d)**,** [**NVDA**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&p=d)**,** [**AMD**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AMD&p=d)\n\n**Catalyst:** The Trump administration is planning to strengthen semiconductor export controls to China, aiming to strengthen the CHIPS act from Biden's term.\n\nAdditionally, DeepSeek is accelerating the release of its new AI model, R2, following the success of its R1 model. (Most of their training is done on NVDA chips)\n\n**Technicals:** Mainly interested to see if we can hold above $130 for NVDA- note that earnings are tomorrow so the short-term performance of the stock hinges on that. Currently long and sold 155C to hedge my position against it.\n\n**Catalyst/Sector Context:** We've seen the CHIPS act actually affect the way that semiconductor companies sell to China- most of those restrictions are bypassed, so this strengthening of export controls might actually affect the industry.\n\n**Risks:** More export controls may lead to China giving tariffs in retaliation- but again, most semis are supply constrained rather than demand constrained so I don't see it as a significant catalyst until more details are released.\n\n**Related Tickers:** [INTC](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=INTC&p=d), [QCOM](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=QCOM&p=d), [ASML](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=ASML&p=d)\n\n**Ticker:** [**BABA**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=BABA&p=d)**,** [**FXI (FTSE China 50 Index)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=FXI&p=d)\n\n**Catalyst:** BABA has introduced its own AI reasoning model within the Qwen framework (like how META has the Llama framework), while we have a surge of all Chinese stock performance following the Chinese government's announcement of liquidity measures.\n\n**Technicals:** It seems as if we've peaked (BABA has gone up close to 50% since the start of this month) for most Chinese stocks in the past few days, I would be interested in being short but I was on vacation this weekend. Interested in shorting BABA specifically if we make another large up move like we did on 2/20.\n\n**Catalyst/Sector Context:** BABA is one of the major competitors that is working on AI models, and is notably using NVDA cards to train its models. \n\n**Risks:** Mainly tariff news and news from other rivals with better models. Straightforward.\n\n**Related Tickers:** [JD](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=JD&p=d), [BIDU](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=BIDU&p=d)\n\n**Ticker:** [**PLTR (Palantir Technologies Inc)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=PLTR&p=d)\n\n**Catalyst:** Previously, PLTR faced concerns due to defense budget cuts and CEO Alex Karp reducing his stake in the company. We've seen it make a massive run from retail and fall just as quickly.\n\n**Technicals:** Interested in playing a small bounce- we're up \\~10% since last earnings report (and pre-crazy move), there is potential for a small bounce here but only entering a small position since it looks like we bottomed early premarket today. \n\n**Catalyst/Sector Context:** Trump directed the government to make significant cuts to the defense budget. (This is a far more significant catalyst than Alex Karp selling shares)\n\n**Risks:** PLTR lives and dies on defense contract money, so obviously further cuts/expansions will affect stock price.\n\n**Related Tickers:** [BA](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=BA&p=d), [GD](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=GD&p=d), [RTX](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=RTX&p=d)\n\n**Ticker:** [**COIN**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=COIN&p=d)**,** [**HOOD**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=HOOD&p=d)**,** [**MSTR**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=MSTR&p=d)\n\n**Catalyst:** The CC market is experiencing heightened volatility due to proposed tariffs and a significant security breach at Bybit, resulting in the loss of approximately $1.5 billion.\n\n**Technicals:** Not too interested in playing this long- still watching to see how we perform but the sell off resulting in the biggest Coin going to $90K has me watching the stock related proxies that deal with the market. \n\n**Catalyst/Sector Context:** CC platforms are highly susceptible to regulatory changes and security incidents.\n\nProposed tariffs affecting digital assets can lead to market vol, while large-scale hacks undermine investor trust and lead to sell-offs in the market as it spreads fear and people wanting to cash out.\n\n**Risks:** Regulatory interventions impose additional compliance costs and operational constraints on CC exchanges.\n\nSecurity breaches not only result in financial losses but also lead to decreased user adoption and revenue.\n\n**Related Tickers:** [MARA](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=MARA&p=d), [RIOT](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=RIOT&p=d)\n\n**Earnings:** [WDAY](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=WDAY&p=d), [INTU](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=INTU&p=d), [CPNG](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=CPNG&p=d)",

    "selftext": "[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/meta-plans-major-investment-ai-160000083.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/meta-plans-major-investment-ai-160000083.html)\n\nMeta Platforms Inc., after pushing into augmented reality and artificial intelligence, has identified its next big bet: AI-powered humanoid robots.\n\nThe company is making a significant investment into the category \u2014 futuristic robots that can act like humans and assist with physical tasks \u2014 and is forming a new team within its Reality Labs hardware division to conduct the work, according to people with knowledge of the matter.\n\nMeta plans to work on its own humanoid robot hardware, with an initial focus on household chores. Its bigger ambition is to make the underlying AI, sensors and software for robots that will be manufactured and sold by a range of companies, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the initiative hasn\u2019t been announced.\n\nMeta has started discussing its plan with robotics companies, including Unitree Robotics and Figure AI Inc. At least initially, it doesn\u2019t plan to build a Meta-branded robot \u2014 something that could directly rival Tesla Inc.\u2019s Optimus \u2014 but it may consider doing so in the future, the people added.\n\nThe humanoid effort mirrors exploratory projects at other technology giants, including Apple Inc. and Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google Deepmind division. A Meta spokesperson declined to comment.\n\nMeta confirmed the creation of the new team to employees Friday, telling them it will be led by Marc Whitten, who resigned as chief executive officer of General Motors Co.\u2019s Cruise self-driving car division earlier this month. He was previously an executive at gaming company Unity Software Inc. and Amazon.com Inc.\n\n\u201cThe core technologies we\u2019ve already invested in and built across Reality Labs and AI are complementary to developing the advancements needed for robotics,\u201d Andrew Bosworth, Meta\u2019s chief technology officer, wrote in a memo reviewed by Bloomberg News. He mentioned the company\u2019s advancements in hand tracking, computing at low bandwidth and always-on sensors.\n\nMeta executives believe that while humanoid robotics companies have made headway in hardware, Meta\u2019s advances in artificial intelligence and data collected from augmented and virtual reality devices could accelerate progress in the nascent industry. Current humanoids are still not useful enough to fold clothes, carry a glass of water, place dishes in a rack for cleaning or conduct other home chores that could get consumers interested in the category.\n\n\u201cWe believe that expanding our portfolio to invest in this field will only accrue value to Meta AI and our mixed and augmented reality programs,\u201d Bosworth wrote. Whitten, who will report to Bosworth, will have headcount to hire around 100 engineers this year, one of the people said.\n\nMeta\u2019s goal is to provide what Google\u2019s Android operating system and Qualcomm Inc.\u2019s chips did for the phone industry by building a foundation for the rest of the market.\n\nThe software, sensors and computing packages that Meta is already developing for its devices are the same technologies that are needed to power humanoids, according to one of the people involved in the project.\n\nMeta has been investing billions of dollars for years into its Reality Labs hardware division, which sells products like the Quest VR headset and the increasingly popular Ray-Ban smart glasses. Meta plans to spend $65 billion this year on related products, including artificial intelligence infrastructure and the new robot work.",

This will likely be on China because they are the only country left of the three (Canada/Mexico). He stated he'll give details at 1 PM on Truth Social.\n\n**Risks:** More volatility near that time, going to position accordingly depending on the context of the tweet, but likely will be trading VXX unless something very context specific.\n\n**Ticker:** [**DDOG (Datadog, Inc.)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=DDOG&p=d)\n\n**Catalyst:** Earnings with an EPS of $0.49 vs. $0.43 expected.

These competitors are rising to meet OpenAI mainly in price, (can you really get better than free?) and are content with being \"second-best\" as long as customers can save in price and they can save in training costs.

The prospect of Apple being in the crosshairs of tariffs or investigations should be on investors\u2019 radars, he said.\n\n>\u201cHowever, if AI iPhones are a success, that could mean steady growth over the next several years,\u201d he added.\n\n>The shares are down 5.4% in 2025, making Apple the\u00a0worst performer\u00a0among the Magnificent 7 except for Tesla Inc. Sentiment has soured in recent months, with tepid demand for the iPhone 16 \u2014 the first to incorporate AI features \u2014 and tariff risks weighing. The company\u2019s recent results were\u00a0mixed, featuring disappointing China and iPhone sales, though the forecast was seen as encouraging.\n\n>Improving China sales would be significant. Apple got about 17% of its fiscal 2024 revenue from the greater China region, according to\u00a0data\u00a0compiled by Bloomberg, compared with about 26% for Europe and more than 40% for the Americas.\n\n>The potential for improved trends in China was demonstrated this week, when Apple jumped on a broadly negative day for markets following a\u00a0report\u00a0that it has started working with\u00a0Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.\u00a0to bring AI features to Apple products in China. The Chinese firm\u2019s chairman\u00a0confirmed the partnership\u00a0on Thursday.\n\n>\u201cWe would view this as a critical catalyst for Apple\u2019s competitive standing in China,\u201d Morgan Stanley analyst\u00a0Erik Woodring\u00a0wrote earlier this week. Citing a survey the firm conducted, he added that Chinese iPhone users are more interested in AI than US or European peers, and that more than 50% said the staggered roll out of Apple Intelligence had \u201ca moderate to significant impact on their decision not to upgrade to a new iPhone this cycle.\u201d\n\n>Any improvement would also come after a period of muted growth compared with Big Tech peers. Apple\u2019s revenue has fallen in five of the past nine quarters, and while analysts expect 4.9% growth in fiscal 2025, this is less than half the 11.6% pace\u00a0expected\u00a0for the overall tech sector, according to Bloomberg Intelligence.\n\n>Within this context, geopolitical tensions loom large. The Trump administration\u00a0imposed\u00a010% tariffs against China, and the country\u00a0retaliated\u00a0with tariffs of its own. China is also\u00a0weighing\u00a0a potential probe into Apple\u2019s policies and App Store fees.\n\n>Analysts are so far downplaying the risk of tariffs, though they note uncertainties like how long they might be in place and whether Apple will get an exemption. Evercore ISI\u00a0sees\u00a0an impact \u201cin the range of 3-4% of EPS,\u201d which it described as \u201crelatively minimal.\u201d Bank of America said the\u00a0impact\u00a0on earnings should be \u201climited\u201d and \u201cmanageable.\u201d\n\n>Still, Apple\u2019s valuation suggests limited room for error. Shares trade at 31 times estimated earnings, roughly 50% above their average over the past decade. The stock also trades at a premium to the broader market and the overall tech sector.\n\n>Following multiple\u00a0downgrades\u00a0this year, just over 60% of analysts recommend buying the stock, a rate well below megacaps like Microsoft Corp., Nvidia Corp., Amazon.com Inc., Alphabet Inc., or Meta Platforms Inc.\n\n>Still, investors continue to view Apple as a relatively defensive stock given its strong cash flow, massive buyback program, high-margin services business, and a lack of heavy spending on AI.\n\n>\u201cApple looks a little problematic in the short term given the valuation and the lack of growth, but you\u2019re not going to find a more impressive cash-cow of a company,\u201d said Wayne Kaufman, chief market analyst at Phoenix Financial Services. \u201cThere\u2019s a reason it remains an institutional and retail favorite.\u201d\n\nLink: [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-13/apple-s-stock-market-performance-is-increasingly-made-in-china](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-13/apple-s-stock-market-performance-is-increasingly-made-in-china)",

But honestly, I see some major red flags:\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udcc9 Shrinking Profit Margins \u2013 Tesla\u2019s margins have been steadily declining for years. Not a great trend.\n\n\n\n\ud83c\udff4\u200d\u2620\ufe0f Musk\u2019s PR Nightmare \u2013 Elon literally gave a \u201cSieg Heil\u201d on live TV. Now, a huge chunk of the world sees him (and by extension, Tesla) as a Nazi. That\u2019s\u2026 not exactly great for brand reputation.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\ude97 Cybertruck is a Mess \u2013 Poor build quality, tons of issues, and at this point, it\u2019s basically a meme.\n\n\n\n\ud83c\udf0d New Political & Tariff Risks \u2013 Tesla is vulnerable to steel and aluminum tariffs, an anti-EV U.S. President, and a California governor who hates Musk and might pull state EV rebates.\n\n\n\n\u26a1 Serious Competition is Catching Up \u2013 Tesla isn\u2019t the undisputed EV/FSD leader anymore. Other companies are matching\u2014or surpassing\u2014them in innovation.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udea6 FSD is Overhyped \u2013 Despite all the robotaxi talk, Tesla\u2019s self-driving tech is still only Level 2-3. Meanwhile, other companies already have Level 4 robotaxis on the road.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udd0b Rising Costs = Profit Squeeze \u2013 Raw material costs are going up, and Trump\u2019s tariffs on China-made batteries could make things even worse.\n\n\n\n\ud83e\udd16 Tesla is Struggling to Attract Top AI Talent \u2013 Even before Musk\u2019s latest antics, nearly all top AI researchers and recent ML PhD graduates from the top schools were choosing OpenAI, Anthropic, or GAMMA (Google, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, Apple) over Tesla or xAI. Now? Even fewer want to work there, which could hurt Tesla\u2019s AI progress.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udd35 Losing Left-Leaning Consumers \u2013 Left-leaning buyers are way more likely to buy EVs than right-leaning ones. And almost every left-leaning consumer has grown to despise Musk, leading them to choose non-Tesla EVs instead.\n\n\n\nTesla used to be the Nvidia of EVs\u2014they were miles ahead of everyone else. But that\u2019s just not the case anymore. There are more non-Tesla EV options every year, and in terms of FSD, several companies already have a better product and better talent. So, to me, a $1.1 trillion valuation feels ridiculous.\n\n\n\nWhat do you guys think? Am I being too bearish, or is Tesla in for some rough times ahead?",

    "selftext": "Pinterest\u00a0shares surged as much as 20% after the social media company reported fourth-quarter earnings Thursday that beat on revenue.\n\nHere\u2019s how the company performed, according to LSEG:\n\n* **Revenue**: $1.15 billion vs. $1.14 billion expected\n* **Fourth-quarter EBIDTA, adjusted**: $470.9 million vs. $444.8 million.\n\nPinterest said its fourth-quarter adjusted earnings per share was $0.56. That figure is not comparable to analyst estimates because the company recorded a deferred tax benefit of $1.6 billion in the fourth quarter.\n\nRevenue for Pinterest\u2019s fourth quarter jumped 18% year over year while net income was $1.85 billion, which included the deferred tax benefit. \u00a0\n\nThe company\u2019s fourth-quarter adjusted EBIDTA margin was 41%, which was higher the 39% that Wall Street was projecting.\n\nPinterest said it expects first-quarter sales to come in between $837 million to $852 million. The midpoint of that range, $844.5 million, topped analysts\u2019 expectations of $833 million.\n\nThe company said global monthly active users grew 11% year over year to 553 million in the fourth quarter. That was ahead of Wall Street estimates of 547.4 million. Pinterest\u2019s fourth-quarter global average revenue per user came in at $2.12, higher than analysts\u2019 expectations of $2.09.  \n  \nPinterest\u2019s latest global monthly active user numbers represent nearly 3% growth from 537 million in brought in during the\u00a0third quarter.\n\n\u201cOur strategy is paying off,\u201d Pinterest CEO Bill Ready said in a statement. \u201cPeople are coming to Pinterest more often, the platform has never been more actionable, and our lower funnel focus is driving results for users and advertisers.\u201d\n\nPinterest\u2019s report comes after other social media companies saw their stock prices rise following strong results for the quarter that ended in December.\n\nSnap shares jumped in after-hours trading on Tuesday after the social media company reported better-than-expected\u00a0fourth-quarter results.

    "title": "Thinking about NVDA beyond 2025 Hyperscaler CapEx Growth",
    "selftext": "With 3/4 hyperscalers reporting earnings already, the reaction to Nvidia has been positive, but stock still trades less than before DeepSeek. I believe the sentiment is that while 2025 will be great, Nvidia is nearing the \"end of great times\" and moving to a \"just good times\".\n\n**Here's my take at a breakdown. I am not an expert, but have read a lot of positive and negative takes, I'm starting this thread to start a discussion not to pump the stock. Please don't comment \"Nvidia diamond hands durr\".**\u00a0I didn't use AI to write this sadly.\n\nI can't link out to some of the resources, but tried to describe them for easy search and find.\n\n**TLDR:**\u00a0Meeting 2025 revenue projections isn't at excessive risk based on CapEx raises so far. It's likely that production capacity may really be the limiting reagent for 2025 revenues not demand. Market is forward looking and there is uncertainity on 2026+ revenues (DeepSeek is one of them) - markets don't like that. However, uncertainity is an opportunity if Nvidia can deliver again - remember stocks climb a wall of worry.\n\n**Disclosure:**\u00a0Own a lot of NVDA. But have covered calls on them, so not a blindfold risktaker.\n\n**Personal take:**\u00a0NVDA is attractive at these levels, but I'd be cautious holding my entire position after the summer 2025 earnings calls from the hyperscalers, because if there's any indication there is a 2026 CapEx slowdown, stock could fall a lot. I can't predict the future, so diversification is important even if you like the stock.\n\nHowever, continued chip innovation that maintains a competitive advantage that leads to higher end customer ROIs compared to other chip alternatives would help. Also, release of one tangible AI product would change the sentiment and game here (e.g. Robotaxis, enterprise solutions used common place for F500 companies, etc). Many are already underway - my company is releasing Gemini for all employees - this goes beyond software engineers. I think diversification across the industry (AVGO, TSM, power producers) could be valuable as time progresses as the AI use case boom happens.\n\n\\-----------------------------------------\n\n**(1) Meeting 2025 Revenue projections isn't at excessive risk based on CapEx raises so far**\n\nBased on\u00a0[stockanalysis](https://stockanalysis.com/stocks/nvda/forecast/)\u00a0consensus 2024 to 2025 revenue growth is estimated to be 52%.\n\n1. MSFT: 55.7B in 2024 to 80B in 2025\n2. Google: 52.5B in 2024 to 75B in 2025\n3. Meta: 39B in 2024 to 60B - 60B in 2025\n\nBased on the numbers written above, the anticipated growth from hyperscaler capex spend is 46% (if we assume concentration of NVDA chip spend as percent of capex steady). Hyperscalers are estimated to be about 50% of Nvidia revenue. To reach the 52% target that means from the remainder of the revenue book, Nvidia needs 58% spend increase.\n\nThis doesn't seem unreasonable.\u00a0**Potential**\u00a0investments through StarGate (Oracle), OpenAI's increasingly independent spending funded by Softbank, and sovereign AI investments are a tailwind to that figure. However, sustained export controls (e.g. Biden's global export framework) and increased crackdowns are headwinds.\n\n**(2) It's likely that production capacity may really be the limiting reagent for 2025 revenues not demand**\n\nBased on multiple\u00a0[sources](https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/nvidias-blackwell-gpus-are-sold-out-for-the-next-12-months-chipmaker-to-gain-market-share-in-2025?utm_source=chatgpt.com), seems like Blackweel is sold out for the next 12 months anyways. So 2025 revenues may be a matter of strong production. Moreover, from the commentary that google had on their earnings call - seems like cloud growth is supply constrained by infrastructure rather than demand constrained. I believe for 2025 at least customers will buy as many NVIDIA chips as they can and its production that determines valuation.\n\nSince the market is forward looking, 2025 revenue misses won't be as crucial as addressing the question of when is the demand going to slow down and the AI semiconductor sales from NVDA slowdown?\n\n**(3) Market is forward looking and there is uncertainity on 2026+ revenues (DeepSeek is one of them)..markets don't like that**\n\nNo matter how you slice it, DeepSeek has provided true software driven advances that more efficiently use Nvidia GPUs and non-NVDA GPUs on the training and particularly inference level. You can look at the cost per inference token for DeepSeek vs. OpenAI. It has raised questions on the sustainability on needing cutting edge chips at high margins in the long run. Risks below.\n\n* **Do closed loop models even have a moat over open source?**: Can closed-loop/proprietary LLMs develop models that demand a strong ROI justifying investment in more chips to\u00a0**train**\u00a0better models that\u00a0**end users are willing to pay for**? Currently Sam Altman & Dario (Antropic) think compute is the way to go. However, at some point they could discover more compute for training =/= better or more efficient models.\n* **Training:**\u00a0Efficiencies in hardware utilization may reduce Nvidia's moat in interconnectivity and lead to better training advances, which could reduce margins if other chips are \"somewhat as good\" eventually given demand equalizes to supply.\u00a0See point # 1 in this excellent recap here  (available by searching DeepSeek and the ramification on the AI industry: winners and losers? by Rihard Jarc)\n* **More use cases in a post training world could mean more inference on custom chips & competitor products:**\u00a0It is widely believed that Nvidia is more of an undisputed leader in training performance vs. inference. If open source models become good enough and training investments do not result in monetizable ROI, Nvidia's margins likely fall as custom chips and other semiconductor players provide good solutions.\u00a0[Jevon's Paradox (more use cases and usage)](https://www.npr.org/sections/planet-money/2025/02/04/g-s1-46018/ai-deepseek-economics-jevons-paradox)\u00a0is very likely here, but volume would have to increase signficantly to offset margin decreases - a risk that the market doesn't like.\n* **CUDA alternatives leads to market share loses?:**\u00a0CUDA is widely known to be the best option \"coding\" platform to get GPUs to do what you want right now.\u00a0[However, there are other applications coming out that allow fungible usage of other chips.\u00a0](https://www.theregister.com/2024/12/17/nvidia_cuda_moat/#:~:text=If%20you're%20doing%20low,AMD%20hardware%20%E2%80%93%20and%20vice%20versa)This reduces the need to use Nvidia chips and pay such high margins. There's drawbacks to not using CUDA that I'll highlight in section 4.\n\nSidenote - there is an\u00a0honest and excellent podcast on DeepSeek implications to Nvidia from Bankless w/ Jeffrey Emmanuel (whose blogpost got a lot of investors interested in DeepSeek impact over 2 weekends ago). Please listen.\n\n**(4) However, uncertainity is an opportunity if Nvidia can deliver again - remember stocks climb a wall of worry.**\n\n* **Early innings of the AI story:**\u00a0Models are going to get more complex not stagnate. This requires more training compute as we try to reach AGI level models. On the inference front, as more use cases explode, there will be more general chip demand. We haven't even seen full released use cases in robotics, autonomous transit, healthcare AI, etc.\n* **CUDA is the lowest latency**\u00a0and provides best performance as of now. There might be a technical limit to how well alternatives perform.\n* **Cost of being last**\u00a0in AI is too great for hyperscalers\n* **Continued innovation leadership:**\u00a0Nvidia has expedited it's semiconductor cycle from 2 years to 1 year. Rubin (next gen AI chips) are already being worked on. Semiconductors are known to be cylical, but this may dull any trough cycle.\n* **Increased soverign AI investments**\u00a0(StarGate, Middle east, etc.)\n* **Ridiculous cash flow with minimal R&D**\u00a0as % of revenue means that Nvidia can invest in strategic ventures, emerging tech, and adjacent spaces to diversify revenue streams. Not sure this is proven out in the financials yet, but could in the future.\n* **Hopefully - reduced interest rates boosts stock valuations**.\n\nI've included a screenshot of interviews by Rihard Jarc with a former AMD employee on CUDA and training needs going forward after DeepSeek.",

    "selftext": "Google\u00a0on Wednesday released Gemini 2.0 \u2014\u00a0its \u201cmost capable\u201d artificial intelligence model suite yet \u2014\u00a0to everyone.\n\nIn December, the company\u00a0gave access\u00a0to developers and trusted testers, as well as wrapping some features into Google products, but this is a \u201cgeneral release,\u201d according to Google.\n\nThe suite of models includes 2.0 Flash, which is billed as a \u201cworkhorse model, optimal for high-volume, high-frequency tasks at scale\u201d; 2.0 Pro Experimental, which is largely focused on coding performance; and 2.0 Flash-Lite, which Google bills as its \u201cmost cost-efficient model yet.\u201d\n\nGemini Flash costs developers 10 cents per million tokens for text, image and video inputs, while Flash-Lite, its more cost-effective version, costs .75 of a cent for the same.\n\nThe continued releases are part of a broader strategy for Google of\u00a0investing heavily into \u201cAI agents\u201d\u00a0as the AI arms race heats up among tech giants and startups alike.\n\nMeta, Amazon,\u00a0Microsoft, OpenAI and Anthropic are also moving toward agentic AI, or models that can complete complex multi-step tasks on a user\u2019s behalf, rather than a user having to walk them through every individual step.\n\n\u201cOver the last year, we have been investing in developing more agentic models, meaning they can understand more about the world around you, think multiple steps ahead, and take action on your behalf, with your supervision,\u201d Google wrote in a December\u00a0blog post, adding that Gemini 2.0 has \u201cnew advances in multimodality \u2014 like native image and audio output \u2014 and native tool use,\u201d and that the family of models \u201cwill enable us to build new AI agents that bring us closer to our vision of a universal assistant.\u201d\n\nAnthropic, the\u00a0Amazon-backed AI startup founded by ex-OpenAI research executives, is a key competitor in the race to develop AI agents. In October, the startup\u00a0said\u00a0that\u00a0its AI agents were able to use computers like humans to complete complex tasks. Anthropic\u2019s computer use capability allows its technology to interpret what\u2019s on a computer screen, select buttons, enter text, navigate websites and execute tasks through any software and real-time internet browsing, the startup said.\n\nThe tool can \u201cuse computers in basically the same way that we do,\u201d Jared Kaplan, Anthropic\u2019s chief science officer, told CNBC in an interview at the time. He said it can do tasks with \u201ctens or even hundreds of steps.\u201d\n\nOpenAI released a\u00a0similar tool\u00a0recently, introducing a feature called Operator that will automate tasks such as planning vacations, filling out forms, making restaurant reservations and ordering groceries. The\u00a0Microsoft-backed startup described Operator as \u201can agent that can go to the web to perform tasks for you.\u201d\n\nEarlier this week, OpenAI announced another tool\u00a0called Deep Research\u00a0that allows an AI agent to compile complex research reports and analyze questions and topics of the user\u2019s choice.

Revenue of $7.66 billion vs. $7.5 billion expected. Ultimately said that data center segment revw will be down in Q1, but had clear positive outlook in 2025 and expected double digit revenue growth. This was what caused the stock to fall despite the initial spike.\n\n**Technicals:** Watching $100 level, but doesn't seem to be an irrational move in my opinion. Note that we've moved from $150 to $107 in the past 3 months.\n\n**Risks:** The vast majority of NVDA/AMD/every semiconductor's business's money comes from selling to businesses- individual consumers are a tiny slice of the pie despite gaming/client businesses growing, so I don't really pay attention to them (one exception is NVDA'S 50 series GPUs selling out within 5 minutes) . We also have threats from NVDA dominance, possible regulations from the US, etc, (Disclaimer: I generally don't invest in AMD)\n\n**Related Tickers:** NVDA, INTC, QCOM\n\n**Offhand Comments:** Overall doesn't seem to have affected NVDA or other semis much because what they cited was weakness that was exclusive to them and not the broader semis market.\n\n**Ticker:** [**GOOG (Alphabet Inc.)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=GOOG&p=d)\n\n**Catalyst:** GOOG/GOOGL reported fourth-quarter 2024 earnings with an EPS of $2.12 vs. $2.12 expected. Revenue of $96.5 billion vs. $96.67 billion expected. Cited FAR more spending in CapEx and a miss in cloud revenue (which signals that other competitors have taken their market share)\n\n**Catalyst/Sector Context:** Market had a pretty negative reaction to the news that they'd be investing far more in capex and missed on cloud revenue (was roughly $9B vs $12B expected).\n\n**Risks:** Elevated capital spending may pressure Alphabet's margins if the capex spending doesn't result in increased revenue, especially amidst increasing competition in the AI and cloud markets. I don't really see the China investigation to affect their stock price much, Google Search and Youtube are blocked in China and I doubt that China is going to let Waymo operate in their cities rather than creating their own solution.\n\n**Related Tickers:** MSFT, META, MAG7\n\n**Ticker:** [**UPS (United Parcel Service)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=UPS&p=d)**,** [**FDX (FedEx Corporation)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=FDX&p=d)**,** [**PDD (Pinduoduo Inc.)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=PDD&p=d)\n\n**Catalyst:** The U.S. Postal Service has suspended accepting parcels from China and Hong Kong following new tariffs imposed by Trump, affecting logistics companies like UPS and FedEx.\n\n**Technicals:** I'm mainly interested in PDD because they own Temu, which focuses on shipping small/low-cost goods to the US and using the loophole for very low shipping costs.\n\n**Catalyst/Sector Context:** The recent suspension by USPS may lead to increased demand for private carriers like UPS and FedEx to handle parcels from China. There are a number of Chinese companies that focus on shipping low cost goods (like PDD).\n\n**Risks:** Heightened tariffs and trade barriers could disrupt supply chains, increase costs, and lead to potential overreliance on private carriers, which may face capacity constraints and regulatory scrutiny.\n\n**Related Tickers:** XPO\n\n**Ticker:** [**UBER (Uber Technologies)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=UBER&p=d)\n\n**Catalyst:** Uber reported fourth-quarter 2024 earnings with an EPS of $3.21 vs. $0.48 expected. Revenue of $12B vs. $11.8B expected. Cited that they plan to do buybacks of their own stock.\n\n**Technicals:** Watching $60 level, no bias.\n\n**Catalyst/Sector Context:** Despite Uber's strong quarterly performance, they cited a potential $1 billion impact from a strong U.S. dollar on future bookings which results in worse earnings overseas.\n\n**Risks:** Outside of self-driving cars (Uber partnered with Waymo to operate in Austin), currency fluctuations and international markets affect companies you wouldn't normally expect. This may move in future from tariff news.\n\n**Related Tickers:** LYFT\n\n**Ticker:** [**USO (United States Oil Fund)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=USO&p=d)**,** [**BP (BP)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=BP&p=d)**,** [**CVX (Chevron )**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=CX&p=d)**,** **Other Oil Stocks**\n\n**Catalyst:** Trump announced that the United States plans to take over the Gaza Strip, relocate its residents to neighboring countries, and redevelop the area.\n\n**Technicals:** USO didn't move much on this piece of news, but if Trump actually makes this a policy then we might see a LOT more volatility in the future depending on how serious we get and if we get involved again.\n\n**Catalyst/Sector Context:** The oil sector is sensitive to geopolitical developments in the Middle East, a region critical to global oil supply. Initial market reactions to Trump's Gaza proposal didn't impact oil prices. Not really a catalyst TODAY but worth thinking about in the future.\n\n**Risks:** Potential escalation of regional tensions could disrupt oil production or transportation, leading to supply constraints and increased volatility in oil prices.\n\n**Related Tickers:** XOM",

    "selftext": "Advanced Micro Devices reported fourth-quarter results on Tuesday that beat Wall Street expectations for sales and earnings, but the stock fell about 6% in extended trading as the company missed estimates in its key data center segment.\n\nHere\u2019s how the chipmaker did, versus LSEG consensus estimates for the quarter ended Dec. 28:\n\nEarnings per share: $1.09, adjusted, versus $1.08 expected\n\nRevenue: $7.66 billion versus $7.53 billion\n\nAMD said it expects $7.1 billion in sales in the first quarter, plus or minus $300 million. It projected its gross margin to be about 54%. Analysts expected AMD to guide for revenue of $7 billion.\n\nAMD reported $482 million in net income, or 29 cents per share, for the fourth quarter, down from $667 million, or 41 cents per share in the year-ago period.The company\u2019s adjusted earnings per share excluded items such as acquisition costs, inventory loss at contract manufacturers, and restructuring charges.\n\nSu told investors on an earnings call that AMD believes it will report \u201cstrong double-digit percentage revenue and EPS growth\u201d in 2025.\n\nThe company\u2019s most important unit is its business selling chips for data centers, which has been growing in recent quarters, thanks to demand for its graphics processing units for artificial intelligence.\n\nAMD reported $3.86 billion in data center sales, which was up 69% on a year-over-year basis. The company said the increase was due to sales both in its Instinct GPUs and its EPYC CPUs, which compete with Intel\u2019s processors.\n\nHowever, analysts polled by FactSet were predicting $4.14 billion in data center sales during the quarter.\n\nFor the full year, AMD\u2019s data center division revenue increased 94% to $12.6 billion. AMD said that $5 billion of those sales were from its Instinct GPUs for AI.\n\nWhile AMD is far behind market leader Nvidia, it\u2019s released competitive data center GPUs in recent years such as the MI300X, that some big infrastructure buyers, including Meta and Amazon, have embraced.\n\n\u201cWe believe this places AMD on a steep long-term growth trajectory, led by the rapid scaling of our data center AI franchise from more than $5 billion of revenue in 2024 to tens of billions of dollars of annual revenue over the coming years,\u201d Su said on the earnings call with analysts.\n\nAMD categorizes its chips for PCs, laptops, and other individual computers as client revenue, which increased 58% on an annual basis to $2.3 billion. AMD said both its chips for desktops as well as mobile computers such as laptops are seeing strong demand.\n\nAMD is also the second-largest producer of GPUs for gaming, behind Nvidia. Revenue in the segment declined 59% to $563 million. The company\u2019s other small division, embedded chips, reported $923 million in sales, down 13% year-over-year.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/04/amd-earnings-report-q4-2024.html",

Tim Cook mentioned that Apple Intelligence DID lead to stronger sales/growth in areas where it was rolled out (it has limited rollout right now).\n\nVolume/Market Cap/Technicals: Watching $250 level, no strong bias. We've seen AAPL swing close to 20% this month, (on report of sales weakness in China) but doubt this will continue.\n\nContext: Most immediate news that comes to mind was the weakness of sales in China for the iPhone, causing the move this month.\n\nRisks: Don't really see immediate risks beyond the trade war, in 2019/2020 this resulted in AAPL moving manufacturing/production to other countries in South East Asia- slowing growth in China has been pretty consistent, however.\n\nRelated Tickers: rest of FAANG, Samsung if you can trade overseas stocks, the various phone component manufacturers that trade with AAPL\n\nOffhand: Apple is investing in its own high-speed network infrastructure to enhance content delivery, (just like META's undersea pipeline)\n\nTicker: [ACMR (ACM Research, Inc.)](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=ACMR&p=d)\n\nCatalyst: Kerrisdale Capital released a bullish report on ACM Research (ACMR), a semiconductor wafer fabrication equipment (WFE) company positioned in China but headquartered in America.\n\nIt leads China as a leading supplier of wafer cleaning tools and beneficiary of China's push toward semiconductor self-sufficiency.\n\nKerrisdale predicts the company to eventually compete globally and cites it as a potential 10x return. Trades at 1x 2025E revenue (likely due to China fears).\n\nVolume/Market Cap/Technicals: This is the interesting part- ACMR holds a $1.2B mkt cap but trades at a massive discount compared to its Chinese subsidiary (ACMS), which has a $5.9 billion market cap and trades at 6x 2025E revenue.\n\nThe report suggests that ACMR\u2019s NASDAQ valuation is severely mispriced and could re-rate significantly as investors recognize the valuation gap.\n\nContext: China/US chip war, you guys know what this is.\n\nSector Context: The global semiconductor industry is shifting, with China attempting to localize chip production.\n\nKerrisdale argues that restrictions on U.S. and Japanese WFE exports to China will only fuel ACMR\u2019s growth as Chinese fabs increasingly turn to domestic suppliers.\n\nChina's WFE self-sufficiency has grown from 4% in 2019 to 17% in 2024 and is expected to reach 36% by 2026.\n\nRisks: Geopolitical factors, including further U.S. export restrictions, could impact ACMR\u2019s operations. Similar to how we have the NVDA trade restriction going on right now. However, Kerrisdale sees these restrictions as a net positive due to ACMR having less competition in China as a result. There are other players in the WFE space in China, but ACMR has a technological moat.\n\nRelated Tickers: LRCX, AMAT, KLAC\n\nTicker: [INTC](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=INTC&p=d)\n\nCatalyst: Intel reported revenue of $14.26B vs exp of $13.81B. Most important, the company anticipated breakeven EPS next quarter.\n\nVolume/Market Cap/Technicals: Somewhat rangebound for the past 3 months. Watching $20 but nothing interesting I'm watching beyond that.\n\nContext: This earnings report is Intel's first since the departure of CEO Pat Gelsinger. Right now INTC is being led by two interim co-CEOs, and another price catalyst that could potentially happen is someone competent being picked lol. Also worth thinking of the NVDA/Deepseek/semiconductor news when reading through these catalysts.\n\nIntel has also announced a delay in its Falcon Shores GPU and only using it internally within the company.\n\nRisks: Intel faces significant competition from companies such as NVIDIA and AMD, the delay of their chip is pretty bad news.\n\nRelated Tickers: AMD/NVDA/TSM\n\nTicker: [ASTS](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=ASTS&p=d)\n\nCatalyst: ASTS has received special temporary authority from the FCC to test its space-based cellular broadband network in the United States. Allows for collaboration efforts with VZ/T.\n\nVolume/Market Cap/Technicals: Slight rise, but will watch this at open to see if volume comes in.\n\nContext: The FCC's authorization allows ASTS to provide cell/satellite comms, allowing for greater coverage and signals that more use of ASTS satellites. I remember that the company was essentially valued based on each satellite they launched successfully in 2024, whether that hype returns remains to be seen but overall not interested in trading this unless we have retail interest again.\n\nSector Context: SpaceX's Starlink is also entering the direct-to-cell market, as I noted a few days ago- most of the investment that can be done in these type of cell/sat comms in public markets can really only be done in ASTS.\n\nRisks: If SpaceX IPOs we might see a selloff in this stock simply because SpaceX is far larger/established and Elon Musk has closer ties to the government.\n\nRelated Tickers: T/VZ/RKLB",

Revenue of $48.4B vs $47B,but guided revenue short of consensus and didn't provide FY25 revenue outlook (which triggered the reason for the selloff post-earnings after the close).\n\nTheir CAPEX announcement was $60-65B vs $52.4B expected, and stated they expected the single largest driver of expesive growth in 2025 as infrastructure costs due to higher OpEX and depreciation.\n\nAlso announced plans to grow META's AI team significantly.\n\n**Volume/Market Cap/Technicals:** Earnings move the stock on far less volume but the initial selloff after announcement was worth trading- interested in the $700 level today but not much beyond that.\n\n**Context:** Decent earnings but signals that there is more spending on the horizon- likely that the initial brutal selloff to $606 was from algos just reading the initial eye-popping CAPEX number and selling the company.\n\n**Sector Context:**There is a major next-level breakthrough that OpenAI is expected to release today that has agents performing on the same level as PHDs, Altman is meeting today with US government officials. META is the creator of Llama, which is another open source model compared to OpenAI's closed models.\n\n**Risks:** Deepseek has been the main threat involved, with competitors from China using distillation and other AI techniques to be able to train a far cheaper model that brings up the question of why our large tech firms are spending so much on GPUs.

Revenue of $25.71B vs $27.23B expected. Most of this revenue miss came from miss in sale of EVs. \n\nTSLA announced interesting plans to lower the price of EVs in 2025 but also didn't give specific details regarding the production volume targets (as they have in the past), and also announced that there would be a paid robotaxi service in Austin in June. This puts them in competition with Waymo/UBER. Personally I think the vision-only approach is not viable in the long-run but hey, I'm no self-driving PHD. \n\nCAPEX was ALSO higher as with META due to spending increases from AI training infra costs and battery production capacity.\n\n**Volume/Market Cap/Technicals:** I'm mainly interested in the $375/$400 level, not too interested in going long despite the multi-day slide in price.\n\n**Context:** Main reason for TSLA's selloff was the lack of full-year guidance (it gives the subtext that it's too bad to release publically or it's up in the air). Political statements made by Musk may contribute to future issues for TSLA.\n\n**Sector Context:** Revenue shortfall was caused due to lower-than-expected vehicle deliveries/ increased sale incentives, 496K cars vs 507K exp. China's BYD is rapidly catching up, and the (possible) removal of the US EV tax credit may make EV's more expensive\n\n**Risks:** Mainly geopolitical- if the tariffs on EV vehicles imported to the US gets removed, TSLA will face fiercer competition from BYD. Also Elon Musk.\n\n**Related Tickers:** BYD (but mainly trades in China, TSLA isn't as impacted by AI news.)\n\n\n\n[**NVDA (NVIDIA Corporation) (in addition to ARM/AMD/SMH/SOXL/semiconductor stocks)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&p=d)\n\n**Catalyst:** The reveal of Deepseek has introduced an AI model that rivals existing solutions but was developed at around $6M. However there's a rumor that Deepseek is actually trained on 50K H100 NVDA gpus.\n\n**Yesterday after the close, there was an announcement Trump officials discussing tightening curbs on Nvidia's China sales.**\n\n**Volume/Market Cap/Technicals:** Overall, there's been a massive selloff since NVDA was $150 at the end of last week. Overall interested again if we hit $116, but low confidence we'll sell off again. \n\nCurrently long.\n\n**Sector Context:** Not much to really say about this beyond NVDA having the most advanced chips that are widespread for training because of the CUDA architecture- most people are doubtful that the TOTAL cost was $6M\n\nUS Officials are examining export restrictions but China will likely find a way to bypass them as they have previously.\n\n**Risks:** Mainly geopolitical, again. Obviously it's very difficult to restrict trade to a country that we have no military presence in or surround, and China is economically far more powerful than those we have attempted trade restrictions on in the past.\n\n**Related tickers:** (Mentioned above)\n\n**Earnings today:** AAPL, INTC, V,TEAM",

Here are your pre-market stock movers & news on this Thursday, January the 30th, 2025-\n\n*****\n\n# [S&P 500 futures rise after Meta Platforms, Tesla report earnings: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/29/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)\n\n*****\n> S&P 500 futures rose Thursday as Wall Street digested recent quarterly results from a slew of megacap tech companies. Investors are coming off a losing session after the Federal Reserve held steady on rates.\n*****\n> Futures tied to the broad market index added 0.3%, while Nasdaq 100 futures advanced 0.5%. Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average were fractionally lower.\n*****\n> Shares of Meta Platforms and Tesla gained 1% and 2%, respectively, while Microsoft shares dipped more than 4% after the companies reported earnings. Meta beat on top and bottom lines, but Microsoft shares faltered after the company\u2019s quarterly revenue forecast disappointed. Tesla shrugged off an earnings and revenue miss. On the other hand, revenue misses from UPS and Caterpillar weighed the indexes down.\n*****\n> Other \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d names are set to report in the coming days, with Apple\u2019s results being due for a Thursday release. Amazon will soon follow suit, as the megacap tech company reports next week.\n*****\n> On Wednesday, all three major averages ended the session lower as a 4% decline in Nvidia weighed on the market.

Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average were also flat.\n*****\n> Futures were trading in step with Nvidia in the premarket, with both trading off their highs during the session. Nvidia added around 2% after suffering a nearly 17% decline on Monday, which resulted in a market cap loss of nearly $600 billion \u2014 the biggest one-day drop for a U.S. company in history. Broadcom and Oracle also traded higher by more than 2% and around 1%, respectively.\n*****\n> Concerns over DeepSeek came to a head on Monday, with the Nasdaq Composite losing more than 3%, while the S&P 500 slid about 1.5%. The Chinese startup last month unveiled a free open-source large language model that it says took less than $6 million to build. The development spurred worries around Big Tech\u2019s investment into AI. DeepSeek surpassed rival OpenAI on Monday to become the most-downloaded free app in the U.S. on Apple\u2019s App Store.\n*****\n> \u201cValuations remain extended, and while vulnerabilities were expected this year, developments like DeepSeek highlight the need for diversification beyond the Mag Seven,\u201d said Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management. \u201cThe 2025 theme of US exceptionalism is now facing uncertainty, with ongoing concerns around tariffs and inflation adding to market challenges.\u201d\n*****\n> Investors\u2019 attention is turning toward corporate earnings due this week. Starbucks is due to report Tuesday after the bell. A slate of Magnificent Seven companies will report in the coming days, with Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Tesla and Apple due later this week.\n*****\n> The Federal Reserve will also kick off its two-day policy meeting on Tuesday. Fed funds futures are pricing in a more than 99% chance that interest rates will remain unchanged, according to CMEGroup\u2019s FedWatch Tool. Inflation data out Friday will give investors further insight on the health of the U.S. economy.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/WwQ6dQl.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx?t=sec_all)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S S&P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/0wLyJjd.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/o8CAqMY.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/8qU5X7B.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/modWclv.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/gzhgYxd.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/BFoktB0.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/vr9VBwI.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS AFTERNOON'S AFTER-HOURS EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/vZfpr7s.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/LZ4VMb2.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/hu1ZLPU.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/MQWygLA.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/2Jf3zi2.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/gbkVQno.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/28/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-premarket-nvda-orcl-jblu-gm.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n> **Nvidia** \u2014 The artificial intelligence darling bounced back about 3% after plunging 17% a day earlier.

    "title": "Nvidia sheds almost $600 billion in market cap, biggest one-day loss in U.S. history",
    "selftext": "Nvidia lost close to $600 billion in market cap on Monday, the biggest drop for any company on a single day in U.S. history.\n\nThe chipmaker\u2019s stock price plummeted 17% to close at $118.58. It was Nvidia\u2019s worst day on the market since March 16, 2020, which was early in the Covid pandemic. After surpassing Apple last week to become the most valuable publicly traded company, Nvidia\u2019s drop on Monday led a 3.1% slide in the tech-heavy Nasdaq.\n\nThe selloff was sparked by concerns that Chinese artificial intelligence lab DeepSeek is presenting increased competition in the global AI battle. Late last month, DeepSeek unveiled a free, open-source large language model that it says took only two months and less than $6 million to build, using reduced-capability chips from Nvidia, called H800s. \n\nNvidia\u2019s graphics processing units (GPUs) dominate the market for AI data center chips in the U.S., with tech giants like Alphabet, Meta, and Amazon spending billions of dollars on the processors to train and run their AI models. Analysts at Cantor wrote in a report on Monday that the release of DeepSeek\u2019s latest technology has caused \u201cgreat angst as to the impact for compute demand, and therefore, fears of peak spending on GPUs.\u201d\n\nThe analysts, who recommend buying Nvidia shares, said they \u201cthink this view is farthest from the truth,\u201d and that advancements in AI will most likely lead to \u201cthe AI industry wanting more compute, not less.\u201d\n\nBut after Nvidia\u2019s huge run-up \u2014 the stock soared 239% in 2023 and 171% last year \u2014 the market is on edge about any possible pullback in spending. Broadcom, the other big U.S. chipmaker to see giant valuation gains from AI, fell 17% on Monday, pulling its market cap down by $200 billion.\n\nData center companies reliant on Nvidia\u2019s GPUs for their hardware sales saw big selloffs as well. Dell, Hewlett Packard Enterprise and Super Micro Computer dropped at least 5.8%. Oracle, a part of President Donald Trump\u2019s latest AI initiative, fell 14%.\n\nFor Nvidia, the loss was more than double the $279 billion drop the company saw in September, which was the biggest one-day market value loss in history at the time, unseating Meta\u2019s $232 billion loss in 2022. Before that, the steepest drop was $182 billion by Apple in 2020.\n\nNvidia\u2019s decline is more than double the market cap of Coca-Cola and Chevron and exceeds the market value of both Oracle and Netflix.\n\nCEO Jensen Huang\u2019s net worth also took a massive hit, declining roughly $21 billion, according to Forbes\u2019 real-time billionaires list. The move demoted Huang to 17th on the richest-person list.\n\nThe sudden excitement around DeepSeek over the weekend pushed its app past OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT as the most-downloaded free app in the U.S. on Apple\u2019s App Store. The model\u2019s development comes despite a slew of recent curbs on U.S. chip exports to China.\n\nVenture capitalist David Sacks, who was tapped by Trump to be the White House\u2019s AI and crypto czar, wrote on X that DeepSeek\u2019s model \u201cshows that the AI race will be very competitive\u201d and that Trump was right to rescind President Joe Biden\u2019s executive order last week on AI safety.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m confident in the U.S. but we can\u2019t be complacent,\u201d Sacks wrote.\n\nNvidia is now the third most-valuable public company, behind Apple and Microsoft.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/27/nvidia-sheds-almost-600-billion-in-market-cap-biggest-drop-ever.html",

    "title": "AI\nDeepSeek Shakes Up Stocks as Traders Fear for US Tech Leadership",
    "selftext": ">Chinese artificial intelligence startup DeepSeek rocked global technology stocks Monday, raising questions over America\u2019s technological dominance.\n\n>Buzz grew over the weekend about DeepSeek\u2019s latest AI model being cost-effective while running on reduced-capability chips, casting doubt on the validity of the sky-high valuations for companies like\u00a0Nvidia Corp.\u00a0The Chinese firm\u2019s product, released last week, is now at the\u00a0top\u00a0of Apple Inc.\u2019s App Store rankings.\n\n>\u201cDeepSeek shows that it is possible to develop powerful AI models that cost less,\u201d said\u00a0Vey-Sern Ling, managing director at Union Bancaire Privee. \u201cIt can potentially derail the investment case for the entire AI supply chain, which is driven by high spending from a small handful of hyperscalers.\u201d\n\n>Founded by quant fund founder Liang Wenfeng, the app\u2019s underlying AI model is widely seen as competitive with OpenAI and Meta Platforms Inc.\u2019s latest.\u00a0Lauded\u00a0by investor Marc Andreessen as \u201cone of the most amazing and impressive breakthroughs,\u201d DeepSeek\u2019s assistant shows its work and reasoning as it addresses a user\u2019s written query or prompt. Reviews on Apple\u2019s app store and on Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Android Play Store praised that transparency.\n\n>Nasdaq 100 futures tumbled as much as 1.9%, while contracts on the S&P 500 fell as much as 1%. The moves represent continued losses from Friday\u2019s cash session, as US shares cooled after gains earlier in the week as President Donald Trump took office.\n\n>In contrast, stocks advanced in Hong Kong, with the Hang Seng Tech Index climbing as much as 2% ahead of Lunar New Year holidays this week. Chinese AI-related stocks including Merit Interactive Co.\u00a0surged\u00a0by their daily limits. Merit is among those with the clearest links to DeepSeek after stating in an earlier filing that it had incorporated the homegrown AI firm\u2019s model into marketing.\n\n>Meanwhile, shares in the AI supply chain slumped as investors rethink their assumptions that the most advanced AI will require increasing amounts of computing power and energy. Major Nvidia supplier Advantest Corp.,\u00a0slid\u00a0as much as 8.6% in Tokyo. Data centers shares also slipped, with Singapore-listed Mapletree Industrial Trust down 3.6%. Markets were closed for holidays in Taiwan and South Korea.\n\n>The DeepSeek product \u201cis deeply problematic for the thesis that the significant capital expenditure and operating expenses that Silicon Valley has incurred is the most appropriate way to approach the AI trend,\u2019 said\u00a0Nirgunan Tiruchelvam, head of consumer and internet at Singapore-based Aletheia Capital. \u201cIt calls into question the massive resources that have been dedicated to AI.\u201d\n\n>Kyle Rodda, senior market analyst at Capital.com, says the updated AI model unveiled by China\u2019s DeepSeek raises concerns about geopolitical risks as well as questions about US tech stock valuations.\n\n>The decline in Nasdaq futures comes at the start of a big week for earnings from major tech companies including Apple and Microsoft Corp. Profit growth is expected to have slowed while valuations remain inflated, once again causing concern over the large AI-driven rally in the sector.\n\n>The Nasdaq 100 is trading at 27 estimated forward earnings, compared with its three-year average of 24 times. Nvidia is at 33 times, though that\u2019s slightly down from its three-year average. Shares of Nvidia were more than 3% lower on the alternative trading system Blue Ocean in Asia morning, according to Kok Hoong Wong, head of institutional equities sales trading at Maybank Securities\n\n>The DeepSeek release raises new doubts, challenging the notion that China\u2019s AI technology is years behind US counterparts. Washington\u2019s trade restrictions had kept the most cutting-edge chips out of China\u2019s hands, but DeepSeek\u2019s model was built using open source technology that is easy to access.\n\n>\u201cWhile current leaders like Nvidia have a strong foothold, it is a reminder that AI dominance cannot be taken for granted,\u201d said\u00a0Charu Chanana, chief investment strategist at Saxo Markets. \u201cThe emergence of China\u2019s DeepSeek indicates that competition is intensifying, and although it may not pose a significant threat now, future competitors will evolve faster and challenge the established companies more quickly. Earnings this week will be a huge test.\u201d\n\nLink: [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-27/nasdaq-futures-slump-as-china-s-deepseek-sparks-us-tech-concern](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-27/nasdaq-futures-slump-as-china-s-deepseek-sparks-us-tech-concern)",

    "title": "Apple Remains a Threat in AR, Even as Meta and Google Race Ahead",
    "selftext": ">Meta and Google have jumped out ahead in the race to make augmented reality glasses for consumers, but Apple remains a looming threat. Also: The iPhone maker brings in a fixer for its Siri and AI efforts, and the company has a decision to make about its longtime chairman. Samsung, meanwhile, just unveiled impressive new AI features and is poised to beat Apple to market with a skinny smartphone.\n\n>A decade ago, it began developing AR technology for its now-defunct attempt to build a self-driving vehicle. The idea: a windshield that could overlay navigation information, traffic alerts, camera feeds and other data while the car drove around town on its own. Apple even built a simulator of the concept at its Silicon Valley offices and managed to turn the idea into a working prototype that showed promise to executives.\n\n>But the company quickly realized that this Minority Report-like experience would be too power-hungry and expensive to put inside of a vehicle. So it turned its attention to headsets, which can provide the same data in a smaller package. A person in the car could simply wear some headgear instead of needing to have the technology built into the windshield.\n\n>The car glasses idea didn\u2019t get too far either. But Apple\u2019s vehicle group poured resources into developing AR displays and used virtual reality goggles to demonstrate the car\u2019s capabilities. That ultimately led to Apple\u2019s work on a consumer headset.\n\n>At the time, Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook felt that VR goggles were too isolating. He preferred AR, which keeps users in the real world while superimposing data on their field of vision. But it was also clear that the true AR dream \u2014 a lightweight pair of glasses that customers could wear all day \u2014 was still far off.\n\n>That\u2019s about the time when Mike Rockwell stepped in. That executive, who currently oversees Apple\u2019s Vision Pro division, moved the AR and VR efforts into a team that was separate from the car unit. Rockwell and his staff spent the better part of two years creating a headset prototype that melded VR and AR into an approach that Apple eventually called spatial computing.\n\n>This was the great compromise: Users weren\u2019t truly seeing the real world around them, but the device\u2019s pass-through cameras made it feel like they were. The project was greenlit, and the company eventually spent billions of dollars to develop the device \u2014 all while continuing to work on making true AR glasses a reality. That led to the release of the Vision Pro mixed-reality headset a year ago.\n\n>Apple had originally hoped to release AR spectacles as a follow-up to the Vision Pro, but the technical challenges were just too great. Such a product remains far away, and the company is still tinkering with the underlying technologies.\n\n>At the same time, rivals like Meta Platforms Inc. and Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google have jumped ahead in the AR race. Meta showed off a prototype of augmented reality glasses last year, and Google is working with Samsung Electronics Co. on their own next-generation devices. Meta also has had success with its Ray-Ban smart glasses, which don\u2019t have a display but can handle tasks like recording video and making phone calls.\n\n>The Vision Pro, meanwhile, has largely been a flop, hurt by its cumbersome design and $3,500 price tag. That said, it\u2019s hard to discount Apple\u2019s innovation abilities. Work on the AR screens remains ongoing at a secretive facility in Santa Clara, California, one town over from the company\u2019s home base in Cupertino.\n\n>Though there were layoffs at the site last year \u2014 when Apple scrapped plans for in-house smartwatch displays \u2014 the company kept some employees around to work on AR technology, along with a manufacturing facility to develop and test future screens.\n\n>Tepid demand for the Vision Pro has only made Apple more certain that AR glasses are a superior format. But the executives involved in the effort don\u2019t think a product will be ready for three years or more. In the meantime, Apple expects to release other devices in the style of Vision Pro that it hopes will be cheaper and more enticing to consumers.\n\n>While it develops the AR technology for future devices, the company is conducting user studies at its offices to gauge the appeal of features and interfaces. Apple is already working on a version of visionOS \u2014 the Vision Pro\u2019s software \u2014 that will run on glasses. It\u2019s also exploring other types of wearable products, including a rival to Meta\u2019s Ray-Ban spectacles and even camera-equipped AirPods.\n\n>The question now is whether Apple\u2019s rivals are getting too far ahead. Meta\u2019s AR prototype, called Orion, will set the stage for a consumer product by 2027. And Google\u2019s new Android XR operating system is meant to usher in a wave of headsets and glasses, with Samsung first in line to release devices.\n\n>When I first tested Android XR in December at Google\u2019s headquarters, the company showed me several glasses prototypes \u2014 with and without displays. They seemed polished for prototypes, but they won\u2019t hit the market until the display technology improves and costs come down. Another issue to be solved: battery life.\n\n>Meta, Google and Samsung also aren\u2019t slowing down on development of VR and mixed-reality devices. Meta is working on Quest 4 VR goggles, as well as a new high-end model that could eventually become a successor to the Quest Pro mixed-reality headset, I\u2019m told. Samsung, meanwhile, showed off the hardware for its \u201cMoohan\u201d mixed-reality headset during its Unpacked event this past week.\n\n>In interviews, Samsung and Google executives hinted that this headset would be cheaper than the Vision Pro and that it\u2019s on track to debut this year. The companies won\u2019t have to share the spotlight with Apple, which is unlikely to ship any major new head-worn device in 2025.\n\n>But the real showdown will come in the years ahead, when AR glasses are refined enough to serve as a smartphone replacement. You can imagine a future where people use smart spectacles as their primary mobile device and then turn to a mixed-reality or VR headset for gaming or computing tasks. In that vision, head-worn devices will have supplanted both phones and laptops \u2014 markets worth hundreds of billions of dollars.\n\n>Given what\u2019s at stake, Apple can\u2019t afford to stay on the sidelines too long. But the company does have a history of swooping into already-established markets and beating competitors with better design and more elegantly integrated hardware and software. The playbook it used so effectively in smartphones and watches could work again.\n\nLink: [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-01-26/apple-ar-plan-meta-samsung-glasses-are-coming-s25-edge-to-beat-iphone-air](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-01-26/apple-ar-plan-meta-samsung-glasses-are-coming-s25-edge-to-beat-iphone-air)",

The White House and Oracle had no immediate comment.\n\n>\n\n>The short video app used by 170 million Americans was taken offline temporarily for users shortly before a law that said it must be sold by its Chinese owner ByteDance on national security grounds, or be banned, took effect on Jan. 19.\n\n>\n\n>Trump, after taking office a day later, signed an executive order seeking to delay by 75 days the enforcement of the law that was put in place after U.S. officials warned that under ByteDance, there was a risk of Americans' data being misused.\n\n>\n\n>The possible deal reported by NPR would mean that American investors would own a majority stake in TikTok. However, the report added that the terms of the deal could change and are still being hammered out.\n\n>\n\n>\"The goal is for Oracle to effectively monitor and provide oversight with what is going on with TikTok,\" a person directly involved in the talks but not authorized to speak publicly was quoted as saying by NPR.\n\n>\n\n>\"ByteDance wouldn't completely go away, but it would minimize Chinese ownership.\"\n\n>\n\n>Other potential investors who are engaged in the talks include Microsoft, NPR reported.\n\n>\n\n>Officials from Oracle and the White House held a meeting on Friday about a potential deal, and another meeting has been scheduled for next week, NPR reported.\n\n>\n\n>Oracle was interested in a TikTok stake \"in the tens of billions,\" but the rest of the deal is in flux, the NPR report cited the source as saying.\n\n>\n\n>Trump has said he \"would like the United States to have a 50% ownership position in a joint venture\" in TikTok.\n\n>\n\n>NPR cited another source as saying that appeasing Congress is seen as a key hurdle by the White House.\n\n>\n\n>Free speech advocates have opposed TikTok's ban under a law passed by the U.S. Congress and signed by former President Joe Biden.\n\n>\n\n>The company says U.S. officials misstated its ties to China, arguing its content recommendation engine and user data are stored in the United States on cloud servers operated by Oracle while content moderation decisions that affect American users are also made in the U.S.\n\n**Thoughts:** There are a TON of entities/people who have been rumored to buy Tik Tok (off the top of my head I can list Elon Musk, META, Kevin O' Leary, Mr. Beast and an assortment of random PE firms, Perplexity AI, and now Larry Ellison/ORCL)- I assume that these entities and affiliated companies may be worth looking at and possibly taking a short position in if they've reacted strongly to Tiktok acquisition rumors in the past.\n\nLink: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/white-house-talks-oracle-us-224145962.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/white-house-talks-oracle-us-224145962.html)",

    "selftext": ">The woes of speaker maker Sonos have raised the prospect of a takeover, but who might want to buy it? \n\n>\n\n>For months, Sonos Inc. has been reeling. After a disastrous software rollout last year, the audio technology company that some used to call \u201cthe Apple of speakers\u201d remains mired in the biggest crisis in its two-decade history.\n\n>\n\n>It all started in May when the company introduced a revamped app \u2014 the software that lets customers control their speakers, soundbars, subwoofers, headphones and other devices. The app was designed to modernize the Sonos experience and lay the groundwork for new types of products, such as the Ace headphones. But it lacked vital features and was hobbled by bugs, turning the simple act of using Sonos equipment into a nightmare.\n\n>\n\n>The missing features \u2014 including the sleep timer, advanced music queues, alarms, and functions related to searching and navigating music libraries \u2014 have mostly been restored. But users have reported that glitches persist in some cases: Devices don\u2019t pair, audio volume will spike without warning, connections fail, and streaming doesn\u2019t always go smoothly.\n\n>\n\n>Sonos should have never launched the new app the way it did and was aware of many bugs prior to the initial release. It should have kept around the old and reliable S2 app and launched the new version as a beta test. Once the revamped software became as dependable as the old app, Sonos could have moved forward with the new version as the default. Of course, that would have provided less of a splashy marketing opportunity \u2014 the chance to flip the switch on a whole new experience.\n\n>\n\n>So here we are. The new app ended up being devastating to employee morale, company revenue and the brand\u2019s reputation. It\u2019s a disaster on par with Apple\u2019s rocky move to its own Maps software from Google in 2012 \u2014 a switch that led to the ouster of the company\u2019s software chief. The big difference is that, for Apple, Maps is one app. For Sonos, the change compromised the software underpinning all its products.\n\n>\n\n>Sonos\u2019 board ultimately needed to take action. More than six months after the launch of the app \u2014 and even after an apology tour from its executives and a multitude of attempted fixes \u2014 the company parted ways with Chief Executive Officer Patrick Spence a week ago. The next day, it also cut loose its chief product officer, who many Sonos employees blamed for the app mess.\n\n>\n\n>In their place is interim CEO Tom Conrad, a co-creator of music streaming service Pandora and former executive at Snap Inc. He has served on the Sonos board since 2017 and was already helping with the app recovery effort. Though the company has vowed to search the globe for a new full-time CEO, many Sonos staffers believe Conrad has the inside track to get the job \u2014 if he wants it.\n\n>\n\n>But with Sonos\u2019 market valuation hovering around $1.7 billion \u2014 down from more than $5 billion during a pandemic-fueled rally \u2014 the board will probably consider whether selling the company makes more sense.\n\n>\n\n>Apple has long been seen as a potential suitor, given the two companies\u2019 similarities. Sonos is focused on premium design with a tightly controlled ecosystem \u2014 just like Apple. They share a penchant for audio technology, and their corporate cultures have some overlap.\n\n>\n\n>Apple could snap up Sonos for $2 billion or so \u2014 less than it paid for Beats \u2014 and it would only cost them a few days\u2019 worth of revenue. Sonos\u2019 hardware could also shore up Apple\u2019s disappointing HomePod and home audio lineup.\n\n>\n\n>But I don\u2019t believe Apple will ever acquire Sonos. If Apple really wanted to build out its home audio business, it already has the hardware, software, content and manufacturing chops internally. It\u2019s just about wanting to get things done properly \u2014 something that Apple is already working on. Later this year, it will launch its own home hub and a new HomePod mini.\n\n>\n\n>The only things it would gain from Sonos are a user base, a collection of patents and the employees \u2014 none of which Apple needs. Sonos\u2019 software is obviously something Apple wouldn\u2019t want, especially in its current state, and audio hardware has become heavily commoditized.\n\n>\n\n>Other potential suitors, such as Meta Platforms Inc., Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google and Microsoft Corp., wouldn\u2019t make much sense either. Meta has all but exited the smart home, choosing to focus on AI and wearables instead. Google has a painful history with Sonos involving patent lawsuits. And Microsoft has increasingly scaled back its interest in non-Xbox hardware in recent years.\n\n>\n\n>Still, there are some major technology companies that might consider the idea. That list includes [Amazon.com](http://Amazon.com) Inc., Samsung Electronics Co., Roku Inc. and Spotify Technology SA.\n\n>\n\n>Amazon seems like the most natural fit. With former Microsoft Chief Product Officer Panos Panay now leading its hardware efforts, the expectation is that Amazon will revamp its device lineup and shift toward more upscale offerings. Sonos\u2019 speakers already work with the entire streaming music industry and are certainly high-end.\n\n>\n\n>Sonos\u2019 premium technology could be the basis for a series of new Amazon Echo devices running the upcoming AI-infused Alexa digital assistant. It would also help Amazon expand into new areas, such as over-ear headphones and soundbars \u2014 two categories the company has explored in the past.\n\n>\n\n>Amazon could certainly afford to buy Sonos, though it would have to overcome regulatory hurdles. Don\u2019t forget: Amazon had to back out of a deal to buy Roomba maker iRobot Corp. after the European Union threatened to block the acquisition.\n\n>\n\n>A European company like Spotify might have an easier time getting a deal cleared. The streaming music service has championed the idea of hardware products that can run services from several different players, which Sonos does well. Spotify has long wanted to get into hardware but struggled to make it happen. Sonos would give them an instant entry, with an excellent range of products that could run its audio services.\n\n>\n\n>Roku is another possibility, though it would probably face antitrust concerns. After all, the company already sells a set of low-end soundbars and TV speakers. If it could make a deal work, Roku would get higher-end products that can potentially command higher profit margins. One caveat: This may need to be a stock-based deal given Roku doesn\u2019t have as much cash on hand as its bigger rivals.\n\n>\n\n>Samsung is a wild card. The company already sells soundbars and subwoofers and even acquired the Harman brand in 2017. But it\u2019s failed to crack the home speaker space. It announced an Echo-like speaker called the Galaxy Home several years ago but never actually brought it to market. Sonos would help it create a more consumer-focused line of home audio gear and provide more modern technology for its home theater products.\n\n>\n\n>For consumers, the best scenario is probably Sonos figuring things out and remaining independent \u2014 the current goal of the company. With the world\u2019s biggest tech giants expanding into every facet of our lives, there is something appealing about an independent brand that plays nice with all the platforms. It\u2019s just unclear how long Sonos will be able to do it alone.\n\n>\n\n>Retail inventory of the current iPhone SE quickly shrinks ahead of new model\u2019s debut. One of Apple\u2019s most significant new products this year will be the the iPhone SE\u2019s replacement. The device \u2014 codenamed V59 \u2014 will mark the beginning of Apple\u2019s transition from Qualcomm Inc. cellular modem chips to silicon designed in-house. It also means the company will no longer sell an iPhone with the now-antiquated home button. The latest model, which will also add Apple Intelligence, is set to launch by the spring \u2014 and there are signs Apple is gearing up for the release.\n\n>\n\n>According to people working in Apple\u2019s retail operations, a surprisingly large number of US stores have little to no inventory of the iPhone SE remaining. Consumers can still get the device from the online store \u2014 and it ships out within a few days \u2014 but finding one at a brick-and-mortar outlet is going to be harder and harder. Apple also has ceased sales of the current SE in the European Union because the device lacks the now-required USB-C port.\n\n>\n\n>The drawing down of inventory is a reliable sign that a new model is coming. But it also suggests that Apple probably won\u2019t keep the current version around \u2014 at a reduced price \u2014 after the update is here. That seems like a missed opportunity, since a cheap iPhone could\u2019ve helped Apple make inroads in some markets. The current SE costs $429, and the new one might be more than that given its enhanced features.\n\n>\n\n>This new iPhone isn\u2019t the only big product update on the horizon. As I wrote last week, look out for upcoming MacBook Airs with the M4 \u201cDonan\u201d chip, as well as fresh low-end iPads, iPad Airs and new Magic Keyboards in the not-too-distant future.\n\n>\n\n>Apple is bringing AI to Mac Mail app in macOS 15.4, even as it scales back notification summaries in iOS 18.3. The Apple Intelligence rollout is continuing with the release of macOS 15.3 in a few weeks. For the first time, Apple is bringing its Genmoji custom emoji to the Mac \u2014 following their debut on the iPhone and iPad. The company will add more features by April with iOS 18.4 and macOS 15.4. The big addition at that time will be the new Siri digital assistant, which will be able to better tap into personal information and use the App Intents technology to more precisely control apps.\n\n>\n\n>But there\u2019s another, more under-the-radar feature coming in April as well: The Mac will get the upgraded Mail app that uses AI to prioritize messages and sort content into different inboxes. Right now, iPad and iPhone users are able to tap into the feature \u2014 which is terrific \u2014 but Mac customers have been left behind. That changes with macOS 15.4, I\u2019m told. For those not familiar with the feature: It sorts mail into a primary category, as well as ones for transactions, promotions, updates and all mail.\n\n>\n\n>In other Apple Intelligence news, the company is scaling back notification summaries in iOS 18.3 and macOS 15.3. For months, news organizations and users have been complaining about incorrect or misleading notifications from Apple Intelligence. Rather than quickly fixing its AI models, Apple is simply pulling the plug on summaries from news and entertainment apps. You can also more easily disable summaries from the lock screen, and recaps are now italicized.\n\n>\n\n>Apple\u2019s ex-chief people officer lands at HP. It\u2019s not easy to join Apple after a career outside the company. The place is run by big personalities like Tim Cook, Phil Schiller, Greg Joswiak and others who have been there for several decades. In other words, if you\u2019re walking into Apple thinking you\u2019re going to change how it operates, you\u2019re in for a surprise.\n\n>\n\n>That was the case with Carol Surface, who joined Apple in 2023 as chief people officer after working at Medtronic Plc, Best Buy Co. and PepsiCo Inc. She flamed out after less than two years. Stella Low, Apple\u2019s short-lived vice president of communications, ran into similar issues in 2022.\n\n>\n\n>Both women were hired by Cook himself and stayed at Apple for way less time than anticipated, but now they have another thing in common: They landed at HP Inc. afterward. Low joined the computer maker as its chief communications officer in 2022 and recently left. Surface just agreed to join HP and is starting March 24. Given Surface\u2019s successful and varied human resources career prior to Apple, she could end up being a good fit for HP.\n\n>\n\n>Speaking of Apple\u2019s insidery culture: It was no surprise that Surface\u2019s role was ultimately filled by Deirdre O\u2019Brien, her predecessor and a 30-plus-year veteran of the company. Low, meanwhile, was replaced by Kristin Huguet, a member of Apple\u2019s PR department since before the original iPhone went on sale.\n\n>\n\n>They\u2019re both capable leaders, but Apple will eventually need to figure out how to bring in more talent from the outside. Right now, the company isn\u2019t always built to handle fresh ideas from newcomers. With Apple\u2019s need to innovate and find new sources of revenue, that might be a problem in the not-too-distant future.\n\n>\n\n**The Schedule**\n\n>Jan. 22 \u2014 Samsung unveils Galaxy S25 line. Samsung is set to announce its Galaxy S25 smartphone lineup at its Unpacked event this week in San Jose, California. This year\u2019s devices aren\u2019t expected to get a major hardware overhaul, with the company instead focusing more on software and artificial intelligence features. But Samsung aims to show that it has an edge over Apple in this area. Stay tuned for coverage of Unpacked this week, including all of the details of the new devices. And if you\u2019re waiting for news on Samsung smartwatches and foldable phones, those will likely debut later in the year.\n\n>\n\n>Jan. 30 \u2014 Apple\u2019s first-quarter results. The earnings report \u2014 the first under Chief Financial Officer Kevan Parekh \u2014 will give details of Apple\u2019s all-important holiday season. Investors will get an idea of how the iPhone 16 is selling, as well as updated AirPods and Apple Watches. The company also should provide the first real sense of whether the Apple Intelligence AI platform is spurring consumers to upgrade their devices. Wall Street is looking for about $124 billion in revenue during the period, a 4% gain from a year earlier.\n\n>\n\n>**Post Game Q&A**\n\n>Q: Why is Tim Cook attending the Trump inauguration?\n\n>A: Many Apple employees are none too pleased that their CEO is heading to Washington to kiss the ring and attend Trump\u2019s swearing-in event on Monday. (Cook also personally donated $1 million to the inauguration fund.) The move seems to clash with Apple\u2019s support of diversity, immigration and other progressive causes \u2014 ones that Cook himself has championed. But it\u2019s equally clear that Apple may need Trump\u2019s help over the next four years as it contends with tariffs, the Justice Department antitrust case and mounting pressure from the European Union. Cook likely believes Trump can alleviate these problems. He\u2019s also not alone in turning out for the president-elect. Most of the world\u2019s most valuable tech companies are sending a high-profile leader to the event.\n\n>\n\n>Q: When are the new Powerbeats Pro 2 launching?\n\n>A: The latest earbuds from Apple\u2019s Beats subsidiary are due imminently. The new accessory has already been submitted to the Federal Communications Commission and other regulators for approval, and the company is gearing up for a press briefing in a week or so to go over the details of the new product. The upgrades will feature a smaller overall design and improvements like Spatial Audio and enhanced noise cancellation that are already available on AirPods. The programming code within iOS also suggests that these earbuds could be capable of collecting heart-rate data from a wearer. I\u2019ve previously reported that Apple is working on this technology and actively testing it.\n\n>\n\n>Q: Why is Apple starting to use US-made chips?\n\n>A: A major, under-discussed risk facing Apple right now is that practically 100% of its advanced processors are made in Taiwan by partner TSMC. If Taiwan goes down for whatever reason (a political crisis, natural disaster or something else), Apple is in big trouble with no real plan B. That\u2019s why moving more production to other areas is so critical, and such a shift is now underway. TSMC is running test production of lower-end Apple chips at a facility in Arizona, the first step toward more ambitious goals. Over time, Apple hopes to get chips from other factories in the US and elsewhere, including Europe. Let\u2019s face it, the company has been fairly lucky so far that its chip production hasn\u2019t suffered major hiccups. Apple\u2019s reliance on one geographic location for the most important component in its devices has been a major hazard for years.\n\n>\n\nLink: [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-01-19/sonos-woes-spark-apple-deal-talk-mail-with-ai-coming-in-macos-15-4-iphone-se](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-01-19/sonos-woes-spark-apple-deal-talk-mail-with-ai-coming-in-macos-15-4-iphone-se)",

    "selftext": "It seems like a significant number of TikTok users are growing frustrated with platforms like Facebook and Messenger, with many potentially rage-quitting or deleting these apps altogether. Considering TikTok\u2019s massive user base\u2014about 1 billion globally and 170 million in the U.S.\u2014even a fraction of this shift could create a noticeable impact on Meta.\n\nThe question is, how might this trend affect Meta\u2019s stock? On one hand, Meta has faced declines before and adapted through diversification and innovations like Instagram Reels. On the other, losing younger users\u2014key to ad revenue\u2014could hurt them long-term, especially with TikTok growing as a major competitor.\n\nWhile Meta\u2019s resources and global reach may help cushion the blow, the perception of a mass exodus could still shake investor confidence.

    "selftext": "Meta is set to cut about 5% of its workforce, focusing on the company\u2019s lowest-performing staffers, CNBC confirmed Tuesday.\n\nCEO Mark Zuckerberg informed employees about the decision to \u201cmove out low performers faster\u201d in a memo posted on the company\u2019s internal Workplace forum on Tuesday. Zuckerberg told employees 2025 will \u201cbe an intense year.\u201d\n\nThe company specified that it is \u201cexiting approximately 5% of our lowest performers\u201d in a separate message posted by a company director. The company has more than 72,000 employees, according to its most recent quarterly report.\n\nMeta said employees affected by the cuts will be notified by Feb. 10 and receive severance in line with what the company has provided previously. The cuts represent Meta\u2019s largest layoffs since the company eliminated 21,000 jobs, or nearly a quarter of its workforce, in 2022 and 2023.\n\nBloomberg was first to report the cuts, citing an internal memo.\n\nThe move follows several major operational changes within Meta aimed at building closer ties with President-elect Donald Trump.\n\nLast week, Zuckerberg announced Meta would end its third-party fact-checking program in favor of a \u201cCommunity Notes\u201d model used on Elon Musk\u2019s platform X, where individual users provide more context to posts.\n\n\u201cThe recent elections also feel like a cultural tipping point towards once again prioritizing speech, so we\u2019re going to get back to our roots and focus on reducing mistakes, simplifying our polices and restoring free expression on our platforms,\u201d Zuckerberg said in a video announcement.\n\nBelow is Zuckeberg\u2019s internal memo, which CNBC obtained:\n\n\"Meta is working on building some of the most important technologies of the world. AI, glasses as the next computing platform and the future of social media. This is going to be an intense year, and I want to make sure we have the best people on our teams.\n\nI\u2019ve decided to raise the bar on performance management and move out low performers faster. We typically manage out people who aren\u2019t meeting expectations over the course of a year, but now we\u2019re going to do more extensive performance-based cuts during this cycle, with the intention of back filling these roles in 2025. We won\u2019t manage out everyone who didn\u2019t meet expectations for the last period if we\u2019re optimistic about their future performance, and for those we do let go, we\u2019ll provide generous severance in line with what we provided with previous cuts. \n\nWe\u2019ll follow up with more guidance for managers ahead of calibrations.

    "title": "China Discusses Sale of TikTok US to Musk as One Possible Option",
    "selftext": "Bloomberg: Chinese officials are evaluating a potential option that involves\u00a0Elon Musk\u00a0acquiring the US operations of TikTok if the company fails to fend off a controversial ban on the short-video app, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nBeijing officials strongly prefer that TikTok remains under the ownership of parent\u00a0ByteDance Ltd., the people say, and the company is contesting the impending ban with an appeal to the US Supreme Court. But the justices signaled during arguments on Jan. 10 that\u00a0they are likely\u00a0to uphold the law. Senior Chinese officials had already begun to debate contingency plans for TikTok as part of an expansive discussion on how to work with\u00a0Donald Trump\u2019s administration, one of which involves Musk, said the people, asking not to be identified revealing confidential discussions.\n\nA potential high-profile deal with one of Trump\u2019s closest allies holds some appeal for the Chinese government, which is expected to have some say over whether TikTok is ultimately sold, said the people. Musk spent more than $250 million supporting Trump\u2019s re-election, and has been tapped for a prominent role in improving government efficiency after the Republican takes office.\n\nUnder one scenario that\u2019s been discussed by the Chinese government, Musk\u2019s X \u2014 the former Twitter \u2014 would take control of TikTok US and run the businesses together, the people said. With more than 170 million users in the US, TikTok could bolster X\u2019s efforts to attract advertisers. Musk also founded a separate artificial intelligence company, xAI, that could benefit from the huge amounts of data generated from TikTok.\n\nChinese officials have yet to reach any firm consensus about how to proceed and their deliberations are still preliminary, the people said. It\u2019s not clear how much ByteDance knows about the Chinese government discussions or whether TikTok and Musk have been involved. It\u2019s also unclear whether Musk, TikTok and ByteDance have held any talks about the terms of any possible deal.\n\nMusk and his representatives did not respond to a request for comment. Musk\u00a0posted in April\u00a0that he thinks TikTok should remain available in the US. \u201cIn my opinion, TikTok should not be banned in the USA, even though such a ban may benefit the X platform,\u201d he wrote on X. \u201cDoing so would be contrary to freedom of speech and expression. It is not what America stands for.\u201d\n\nByteDance and TikTok representatives didn\u2019t respond to messages seeking comment. The Cyberspace Administration of China and China\u2019s Ministry of Commerce, government agencies that could be involved in decisions about TikTok\u2019s future, also didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe talks in Beijing suggest that TikTok\u2019s fate may no longer be in ByteDance\u2019s sole control, said the people. Chinese officials recognize they will face tough negotiations with the Trump administration over tariffs, export controls and other issues, and they see the TikTok negotiations as a potential area for reconciliation, they said.\n\nThe Chinese government holds a so-called golden share in a ByteDance affiliate that gives it influence over the company\u2019s strategy and operations. TikTok maintains that the control only applies to the China-based subsidiary Douyin Information Service Co., and has no bearing on ByteDance operations outside China. Still, Beijing\u2019s export rules prevent Chinese companies from selling their software algorithms, like the one integral to TikTok. Because the Chinese government would have to approve of a sale that includes TikTok\u2019s valuable recommendation engine, it has a significant voice in any possible deal.\n\nTikTok\u2019s US operations could be valued at\u00a0around $40 billion to $50 billion, Bloomberg Intelligence analysts Mandeep Singh and Damian Reimertz estimated last year. That\u2019s a substantial sum even for the world\u2019s richest person. It\u2019s not clear how Musk could pull off such a transaction, whether it would require the sale of other holdings, or whether the US government would approve. He paid $44 billion for Twitter in 2022, and is still paying off sizable loans.\n\nMusk has a positive reputation among many ByteDance employees in China, according to a person familiar with the matter. He is seen as a very successful entrepreneur, who has experience engaging with the Chinese government through his\u00a0Tesla Inc.\u00a0business, the person added.\n\nByteDance\u2019s leaders have repeatedly said their priority is to fight US legislation that requires the Beijing-based company sell or shut down the US operations because of national security concerns. TikTok\u2019s lawyers have argued the legislation violates free speech laws under the Constitution\u2019s First Amendment.\n\nA majority of the Supreme Court justices suggested the security concerns take priority over free speech, although they have yet to issue a formal decision. President-elect Trump, who takes office Jan. 20, has sought to delay the TikTok ban \u2014 which takes effect Jan. 19 \u2014 so he can work on the negotiations. He has said he wants to \u201csave\u201d the app and there\u2019s been speculation he could take last-minute action to sidestep the ban.\n\nOn a practical level, spinning off TikTok\u2019s US business would be highly complex, affecting shareholders in China as well as the US. Lawyers for TikTok argued before the Supreme Court that separating the US portions of the product would be \u201cextraordinarily difficult.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s unclear if US TikTok would be sold off in a competitive process, or if a sale would be arranged by the government. Billionaire Frank McCourt and \u201cShark Tank\u201d investor Kevin O\u2019Leary are part of a bid through Project Liberty to acquire TikTok, which O\u2019Leary has\u00a0said he\u00a0discussed with Trump. In the past,\u00a0Microsoft Corp.\u00a0had sought to acquire the business, and\u00a0Oracle Corp.\u00a0has a deep technology partnership with the company.\n\nOne alternative for TikTok would be to move its existing US customers over to a similar app \u2014 with different branding \u2014 to potentially sidestep the ban, one of the people said. It\u2019s not clear how effective such a move would be.\n\nOne person close to the company, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the strategy, said before the Supreme Court hearing that the legal battle is still the focus of top executives and they would prefer to keep fighting in the US rather than sell TikTok US and cede control for good.\n\nMusk is in a position to influence the China-US relationship as the world\u2019s richest person with businesses that straddle the world\u2019s two largest economies. Tesla, where Musk is chief executive officer, erected a sprawling factory in Shanghai in 2019 and has since expanded the facility into the company\u2019s largest production base. The effort helped Tesla expand its market share in China despite tough local competition, and build goodwill with government officials.\n\nWhile Trump is staffing his incoming administration with China hawks like Secretary of State nominee\u00a0Marco Rubio, Musk has spoken out against some recent China trade policies, including the Biden administration\u2019s tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles.\n\n[Link](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-14/china-discusses-sale-of-tiktok-us-to-musk-as-one-possible-option)\n\n**Thoughts:** Obviously this type of news has the ability to move TSLA/META/social networks. We've seen TSLA make moves from political news, SpaceX news, Twitter news, and TSLA trades as a proxy to whatever Elon Musk is doing at the time even if it's not directly applicable to TSLA as a company. \n\nVery low probability of it happening but interesting to brainstorm trading ideas. \n\nAnd hey, Bloomberg's writing about it so it's not random ravings of a lunatic on the internet.",

    "selftext": ">For years it\u2019s seemed like nothing could stop the stock market\u2019s inexorable march higher, as the\u00a0S&P 500 Index\u00a0soared more than 50% from the start of 2023 to the end of 2024, adding $18 trillion in value in the process. Now, however, Wall Street is seeing what can ultimately derail this rally: Treasury yields above 5%.\n\n>Equities traders have shrugged off the bond market\u2019s warnings for months, focusing instead on the windfall from President-elect\u00a0Donald Trump\u2019s promised tax cuts and the seemingly limitless possibilities of artificial intelligence. But the risk came into focus last week as Treasury yields climbed toward their ominous milestones and share prices sank in response.\n\n>The yield on\u00a020-year US Treasuries\u00a0breached 5% on Wednesday and jumped back above on Friday, reaching the highest since Nov. 2, 2023. Meanwhile,\u00a030-year US Treasuries\u00a0briefly crossed 5% on Friday to the highest since Oct. 31, 2023. Those yields have risen roughly 100 basis points since mid-September, when the Federal Reserve started\u00a0reducing the fed funds rate, which has come down 100 basis points over the same time.\n\n>\u201cIt is unusual,\u201d\u00a0Jeff Blazek, co-CIO of multi-asset strategies at Neuberger Berman, said of the dramatic and rapid jump in bond yields in the early months of an easing cycle. Over the past 30 years, intermediate and longer-term yields have been relatively flat or modestly higher in the months after the Fed initiated a string of rate cuts, he added.\n\n>Traders are watching the policy-sensitive\u00a010-year Treasury yield, which is the highest it\u2019s been since October 2023 and is rapidly approaching 5%, a level they fear could spark a stock market correction. It last passed the threshold briefly in October 2023, and before that you have to go back to July 2007.\n\n>\u201cIf the 10-year hits 5% there will be a knee-jerk reaction to sell stocks,\u201d said\u00a0Matt Peron, Janus Henderson\u2019s global head of solutions. \u201cEpisodes like this take weeks or maybe a few months to play out, and over the course of that the S&P 500 could get to down 10%.\u201d\n\n>The reason is fairly simple. Rising bond yields make returns on Treasuries more attractive, while also increasing the cost of raising capital for companies.\n\n>The spillover into the stock market was apparent on Friday, as the S&P 500\u00a0tumbled 1.5%\u00a0for its worst day since mid-December, turned negative for 2025, and came close to wiping out all the gains from the November euphoria sparked by Trump\u2019s election.\n\n>While there\u2019s \u201cno magic\u201d to the fixation on 5% beyond round-number psychology, perceived barriers can create \u201ctechnical barriers,\u201d said\u00a0Kristy Akullian, Blackrock\u2019s head of iShares investment strategy. Meaning, a swift move in yields can make it difficult for stocks to rise.\n\n>Investors are already seeing how. The earnings yield for the S&P 500 is sitting 1 percentage point below what\u2019s offered by 10-year Treasuries,\u00a0a development\u00a0last seen in 2002. In other words, the return on owning a significantly less risky asset than the US equities benchmark hasn\u2019t been this good in a long time.\n\n>\u201cOnce yields get higher it becomes harder and harder to rationalize valuation levels,\u201d said\u00a0Mike Reynolds, vice president of investment strategy at Glenmede Trust. \u201cAnd if earnings growth starts to falter, there can be issues.\u201d\n\n>Not surprisingly, strategists and portfolio managers predict a\u00a0bumpy road\u00a0ahead for stocks. Morgan Stanley\u2019s Mike Wilson anticipates a\u00a0tough six months\u00a0for equities, while Citigroup\u2019s wealth division told clients there\u2019s a\u00a0buying opportunity\u00a0in bonds.\n\n>The path to 5% on the 10-year Treasury became more realistic on Friday after strong jobs data caused economists to\u00a0reduce expectations\u00a0for rate cuts this year. But this isn\u2019t just about the Fed.\u00a0The selloff in bonds is global\u00a0and based on sticky inflation, hawkish central banks, ballooning government debts, and extreme uncertainties presented by the incoming Trump administration.\n\n>\u201cWhen you\u2019re in hostile waters, yields above 5% is where all bets are off,\u201d\u00a0Mark Malek, chief investment officer at Siebert, said.\n\n>What equity investors need to know now is if, and when, serious buyers step in.\n\n>\u201cThe real question is where we go from there,\u201d said\u00a0Rick de los Reyes, a portfolio manager at T. Rowe Price. \u201cIf it\u2019s 5% on its way to 6% then that\u2019s going to get people concerned, if it\u2019s 5% before stabilizing and ultimately going lower then things will be fine.\u201d\n\n>Red Flags\n\n>The key isn\u2019t so much that yields are rising, but why, market pros say. A slow increase as the US economy improves can help stocks. But a quick jump due to concerns about inflation, the federal deficit and policy uncertainty is a red flag.\n\n>In recent years, whenever yields have risen quickly, stocks have sold off. The difference this time appears to be complacent investors, as seen in bullish positioning in the face of frothy valuations and uncertainties about Trump\u2019s policies. And that\u2019s putting equities in a vulnerable position.\n\n>\u201cWhen you look at rising prices, a strong job market and an overall strong economy, it all points to a possible uptick in inflation,\u201d said\u00a0Eric Diton, president of the Wealth Alliance. \u201cAnd that\u2019s not even including Trump\u2019s policies.\u201d\n\n>One area that may prove to be a haven for equity investors is the group that\u2019s been driving most of the gains these past few years: Big Tech. The so-called Magnificent Seven companies \u2014 Alphabet Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Apple Inc., Meta Platforms Inc., Microsoft Corp., Nvidia Corp. and Tesla Inc. \u2014 are still posting rapid earnings growth and massive cash flows. Plus, looking to the future, they\u2019re expected to be the biggest beneficiaries of the artificial intelligence revolution.\n\n>\u201cInvestors typically seek high quality stocks with strong balance sheets and strong cash flows during market turmoil,\u201d said Eric Sterner, chief investment officer at Apollon Wealth. \u201cThe mega techs have become part of that defensive play recently.\u201d\n\n>That\u2019s the hope many equity investors are hanging on, that mega-cap tech companies\u2019 sway over the broader market and their relative security will limit any weakness in the stock market. The Magnificent Seven have a more than\u00a030% weighting\u00a0in the S&P 500.\n\n>At the same time, the Fed is in the midst of lowering interest rates, although the pace is likely going to be slower than expected. That makes this a very different situation than 2022, when the Fed was hiking rates rapidly and indexes plunged.\n\n>Still, many Wall Street pros are urging investors to proceed cautiously for the time being as rate risk hits in various unexpected ways.\n\n>\u201cThe companies in the S&P 500 that are up the most will probably be the most vulnerable \u2014 and that could include the Mag Seven \u2014 and some frothy areas of mid-cap and small-cap growth will likely be under pressure,\u201d said Janus Henderson\u2019s Peron. \u201cWe\u2019ve been consistent across our firm on staying focused on quality and being valuation sensitive. That will be very important in the coming months.\u201d\n\n>\n\n[Link](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-12/s-p-s-18-trillion-rally-threatened-by-psychology-of-5-yields)",

    "selftext": "https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/10/24341039/meta-apple-mark-zuckerberg-trash-talks-joe-rogan-interview\n\n> Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg thinks Apple \u201c[hasn\u2019t] really invented anything great in a while\u201d and that it has been coasting off of its past success. \u201cSteve Jobs invented the iPhone and now they\u2019re just kind of sitting on it 20 years later,\u201d he said this week. Zuckerberg made the statements during a nearly three-hour long podcast with Joe Rogan where, along with discussing Meta\u2019s moderation policy changes and turn against diversity and inclusion policies, they got into Meta\u2019s beef with Apple and its policies.\n\n> The conversation actually started with Rogan\u2019s issues with Apple. Rogan said he\u2019s moving \u201cfrom Apple to Android\u201d in part because he doesn\u2019t \u201clike being attached to one company.\u201d He also isn\u2019t a fan of Apple\u2019s App Store policies. \u201cThe way they do that Apple store, where they charge people 30 percent,\u201d he said. \u201cThat seems so insane that they can get away with doing that.\u201d \u201cI have some opinions about this,\u201d Zuckerberg said. While he gives credit to the iPhone as \u201cobviously one of the most important inventions probably of all time,\u201d he argued that Apple has put rules in place that \u201cfeel arbitrary.\u201d Zuckerberg said that Apple has \u201cthoroughly hamstrung the ability for anyone else to build something that can connect to the iPhone in the same way\u201d as Apple\u2019s own products, like the AirPods. If Apple let other people use its protocol, \u201cthere would probably be much better competitors to AirPods out there,\u201d Zuckerberg said.\n\n> Down the line, Zuckerberg envisions a world where you\u2019ll be able to use the neural interface wristband and the glasses to text a friend or an AI and have the glasses give you the answer. He also believes that as smart glasses or even contact lenses as a computing platform become more developed, the internet will be \u201coverlaid\u201d on the physical world. \u201cI think we\u2019ll basically be in this wild world where most of the world will be physical, but there will be this increasing amount of virtual objects or people who are beaming in or hologramming into different things to interact in different ways,\u201d he said. \u201cThere isn\u2019t a physical world and a digital world anymore,\u201d he added. \u201cWe\u2019re in 2025. It\u2019s one world.\u201d",

    "selftext": ">Amazon has turned into an online ad juggernaut in recent years, with brands paying big bucks for premium placement on the retailer\u2019s websites. Now, Amazon is letting other sites use its ad technology for their own stores.\n\n>The new offering, called Amazon Retail Ad Service, allows companies to show \u201ccontextually relevant ads in the right place and at the right time\u201d in search results, product pages and other areas of their site, Amazon said Thursday.\n\n>It\u2019s initially available for U.S. retailers, which will pay fees based on usage levels. Prices weren\u2019t disclosed.\n\n>Amazon in 2022 began breaking out ad revenue in its quarterly earnings reports, showing that the business had become a significant contributor to the company\u2019s top and bottom lines. Ad revenue in the latest quarter came in at $14.3 billion, third to Alphabet and Meta in digital advertising.\n\n>That\u2019s still much less than the sales Amazon generates from online stores and cloud computing, which came to $61.4 billion and $27.4 billion, respectively, in the quarter that ended in October.\n\n>The bulk of Amazon\u2019s ad revenue comes from sponsored product advertisements, which are keyword-targeted ads that let brands promote certain items. Amazon has stuffed more of these sponsored items into search results and product pages over time. It also generates some ad revenue through streaming.\n\n>With Amazon Retail Ad Service, users will be able to customize the design, placement and number of ads shown across their sites, as well as use Amazon\u2019s ad measurement and reporting tools.\n\n>The service could provide Amazon with valuable data it can use to bolster its ad prediction and recommendation technology. The company said early customers include health and wellness retailer iHerb, Asian grocery startup Weee! and Oriental Trading Co., which sells toys, party and craft supplies.\n\n>\u201cWe\u2019ve designed this to be a win for retailers, advertisers, and shoppers, and we look forward to seeing how it improves outcomes, drives sales and enhances the shopping experience,\u201d said Paula Despins, vice president of Amazon Ads Measurement, in the press release.\n\n>The announcement comes a few days before the National Retail Federation\u2019s annual trade show.\n\n>It\u2019s not the first time Amazon has sold its in-house technology and services to third parties.\n\n>Amazon Web Services began as cloud infrastructure to support its online retail business. The company launched AWS as a business in 2006. In 2022, the company launched Buy With Prime, which combines Amazon\u2019s payment and fulfillment services for other retailers.\n\n[Link](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/09/amazon-to-expand-ad-unit-by-letting-retailers-use-ad-tools-on-stores.html)",

Teva, which is led by CEO Richard Francis, saw its stock rise by 111% in 2024 and now has a market cap of $24.6 billion. Bank of America raised its price target for Teva shares from $25 to $26, citing positive financial results, plans to sell its active ingredients division, and significant debt reduction efforts. Additionally, the success of duvakitug, a drug for inflammatory bowel disease co-developed with Sanofi, boosted investor confidence after strong Phase 2 trial results. Analysts believe Teva's strong product pipeline and turnaround strategy leave room for further price increases.\n\nIn the Internet sector, Cantor Fitzgerald selected Wix.com as a top pick alongside major players like Meta, Amazon, and DoorDash. Wix, under the leadership of CEO Avishai Abrahami, saw its stock rise by 74% in 2024, bringing its market cap to $12.1 billion. Cantor Fitzgerald raised its price target for Wix shares from $240 to $260, emphasizing the company's robust roadmap, pricing strength, and new AI product launches. Analysts believe these factors will drive growth and expand Wix\u2019s trading multiples. Furthermore, Wix is seen as a potential acquisition target, adding to its attractiveness for investors. \n\nBoth companies have demonstrated significant momentum and are positioned for further success in 2025, driven by innovation and strategic initiatives.",

    "selftext": "https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/07/meta-eliminates-third-party-fact-checking-moves-to-community-notes.html\n\nMeta on Tuesday announced it will eliminate its third-party fact checking program to \u201crestore free expression\u201d and move to a \u201cCommunity Notes\u201d model, similar to the system that exists on Elon Musk\u2019s platform X.\n\nThe company said Community Notes will be written and rated by contributing users to provide more context to posts across its platforms, and the feature will roll out in the U.S. over the next couple of months. The announcement marks Meta\u2019s latest attempt to smooth over relations with Republican President-elect Donald Trump before he takes office.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve reached a point where it\u2019s just too many mistakes, and too much censorship,\u201d Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said Tuesday in a video announcement. \u201cThe recent elections also feel like a cultural tipping point towards once again prioritizing speech, so we\u2019re going to get back to our roots and focus on reducing mistakes, simplifying our polices and restoring free expression on our platforms.\u201d\n\nZuckerberg said the third-party fact checkers have been \u201ctoo politically biased\u201d and have \u201cdestroyed more trust than they\u2019ve created, especially in the U.S.\u201d\n\nMeta said it will simplify its content policies by removing restrictions on subjects like immigration and gender and implement a new approach to policy enforcement that will focus on illegal and high severity violations. The company is moving its trust and safety and content moderation teams from California, a historically Democratic state, to Texas, a historically Republican state.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to work with President Trump to push back on governments around the world that are going after American companies and pushing to censor more,\u201d Zuckerberg said.\n\nJoel Kaplan, Meta\u2019s head of global policy, appeared on \u201cFox and Friends\u201d Tuesday and said Meta thinks the Community Notes system on Musk\u2019s platform X has been working \u201creally well.\u201d Musk, who has been a vocal advocate for Trump online and donated millions of dollars to his campaign, has been in close contact with the president-elect since the election.\n\nLast week, Meta said that Kaplan would become the company\u2019s top policy officer, replacing Nick Clegg, who was a former British deputy prime minister and a leader of Britain\u2019s centrist Liberal Democrats party.\n\nKaplan, who has held several policy related positions at Meta since joining the company in 2011 when it was still named Facebook, is well-known within the Republican party. He was a White House deputy chief of staff under former President George W. Bush and also once worked as a law clerk for former Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia.\n\nIn December, Kaplan revealed in a Facebook post that he joined Vice-President Elect JD Vance and Trump during their recent visit at the New York Stock Exchange.\n\n\u201cWe want to make it so that, bottom line, if you can say it on TV, you say it on the floor of Congress, you certainly ought to be able to say it on Facebook and Instagram without fear of censorship,\u201d Kaplan said Tuesday.\n\nProminent Republican lawmakers have previously criticized Meta and other technology companies for allegations regarding the censorship of conservative voices on their respective platforms. For instance, House Judiciary Chair Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, subpoenaed Zuckerberg and other tech CEOs in 2023 as part of a probe to \u201cunderstand how and to what extent the Executive Branch coerced and colluded with companies and other intermediaries to censor speech.\u201d\n\nZuckerberg has had a rocky relationship with Trump over the years, with the president-elect more recently describing Facebook as an \u201cenemy of the people\u201d in a March interview with CNBC. Meta levied a two-year suspension on Trump\u2019s Facebook and Instagram accounts in 2021 shortly after the company determined that the former president\u2019s actions following the Jan. 6 insurrection in Washington, D.C., could potentially incite more violence.\n\nIn 2023, Trump was able to regain access to his Facebook and Instagram accounts, but he also faced some restrictions and potential penalties if he were to violate the company\u2019s community guidelines. Meta eventually removed Trump\u2019s account-related restrictions in July during the lead up to the 2024 U.S. presidential election.\n\n",

    "selftext": "Oracle\u00a0shares dropped 8% on Tuesday and headed for their steepest decline in a year following the database software vendor\u2019s disappointing earnings report.\n\nThe stock\u2019s worst day of the year had been a 5.4% decline in May. The shares are still up about 68% in 2024, which would be the best annual performance since the dot-com boom of 1999.\n\nAfter the close Monday, Oracle reported adjusted earnings per share for the fiscal second quarter of $1.47, trailing analysts\u2019 average estimate by a penny, according to LSEG. Revenue rose 9% from a year earlier to $14.06 billion, missing the $14.1 billion average estimate.\n\nNet income increased 26% to $3.15 billion, or $1.10 a share, from $2.5 billion, or 89 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue in Oracle\u2019s cloud services business jumped 12% from a year earlier to $10.81 billion, accounting for 77% of total revenue.\n\n\u201cA bit of a stumble here for a stock that\u2019s created some lofty expectations for itself,\u201d wrote analysts at KeyBank Capital Markets in a note after the report on Monday. They still recommend buying the stock and said \u201cwe still like oracle heading into 2025.\u201d\n\nFor the current quarter, Oracle expects revenue growth of 7% to 9%. At the midpoint of that range, revenue would be about $14.3 billion. Analysts were expecting sales of $14.65 billion, according to LSEG. The company said it expects adjusted earnings of $1.50 to $1.54 per share. Analysts were calling for earnings per share of $1.57.\n\nOracle\u2019s biggest growth engine has been cloud infrastructure, where it is competing with\u00a0Amazon,\u00a0Microsoft\u00a0and\u00a0Google\u00a0as businesses move workloads out of their own data centers.  \n  \nThe business is booming due to soaring demand for computing power that can handle artificial intelligence projects. Oracle said revenue in its cloud infrastructure unit surged 52% from a year earlier to $2.4 billion.  \n  \nOracle said it just signed an agreement with\u00a0Meta, allowing the social media company to use its infrastructure to help with various projects related to the\u00a0Llama family of large language models.\n\n\u201cOracle Cloud Infrastructure trains several of the world\u2019s most important generative AI models because we are faster and less expensive than other clouds,\u201d Oracle founder\u00a0Larry Ellison\u00a0said in a statement.\n\nAnalysts at Piper Sandler raised their price target on the stock to $210 from $185 \u201cbased on continued cloud momentum.\u201d They cited Oracle\u2019s cRPO (current remaining performance obligations) growth of 20%. That figures points to contracted revenue that has yet to be booked.\n\nSource: [https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/10/oracle-shares-head-for-worst-day-of-2024-after-q2-earnings-miss.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/10/oracle-shares-head-for-worst-day-of-2024-after-q2-earnings-miss.html)",

That is enough to power more than one million homes. Neal Kirby, an Entergy spokesman, said the plants will also provide power to the surrounding community.\n\n\u201cEntergy raised its earnings growth outlook substantially (solely because of this 1 new customer) and the stock rose 15% on that day,\u201d wrote Rodney Rebello, an analyst covering power stocks at Reaves Asset Management, in an email to\u00a0*Barron\u2019s*.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s a monumental deal for the sector.\u201d\n\nMeta spokeswoman Stacey Yip told\u00a0*Barron\u2019s*\u00a0the Louisiana data center \u201cwill be significantly larger than our other data center campuses.\u201d\n\nThe company didn\u2019t say how many GPUs the new facility will be able to support. Yip said estimating the future number of GPUs is becoming complex as GPU technology becomes more efficient.\n\nYip also said Meta will invest in 1.5 gigawatts worth of renewable energy, such as solar and wind, to reduce its carbon footprint. All told, Meta will help finance \u201cenough clean and renewable energy to the grid to match the total electricity use of this data center,\u201d she wrote in an email.\n\nBut it isn\u2019t clear when those renewable projects will start. Entergy has filed for permission with the state utilities commission to build the natural gas plants, but not the renewable ones yet, Kirby said.\n\nMeta also said on Tuesday that it is exploring using nuclear energy to power data centers, and asked companies in that field to submit proposals for nuclear reactors. Any reactors wouldn\u2019t be available until well into the 2030s, however.\n\nMeta is investing\u00a0heavily in artificial intelligence\u00a0and has been expanding the number of data centers it uses to process its AI applications. But even as the AI race accelerates, this Louisiana data center doesn\u2019t look like it will be completed soon. The company said construction will \u201ccontinue through 2030 with site work beginning in December.\u201d\n\n",

    "selftext": "The U.S. Federal Trade Commission has opened a broad antitrust investigation into\u00a0Microsoft, including of its software licensing and cloud computing businesses, a source familiar with the matter said on Wednesday.\n\nThe probe was approved by FTC Chair Lina Khan ahead of her likely departure in January. The election of Donald Trump as U.S. president, and the expectation he will appoint a fellow Republican with a softer approach toward business, leaves the outcome of the investigation up in the air.  \n  \nThe FTC is examining allegations the software giant is potentially abusing its market power in productivity software by imposing punitive licensing terms to prevent customers from moving their data from its Azure cloud service to other competitive platforms, sources confirmed earlier this month.  \n  \nThe FTC is also looking at practices related to cybersecurity and artificial intelligence products, the source said on Wednesday.\n\nMicrosoft declined to comment on Wednesday.  \n  \nThe FTC fielded complaints about Microsoft last year as it examined the cloud computing market.\n\nNetChoice, a lobbying group that represents online companies including Amazon and Google, which compete with Microsoft in cloud computing, criticized Microsoft\u2019s licensing policies, and its integration of AI tools into its Office and Outlook.\n\n\u201cGiven that Microsoft is the world\u2019s largest software company, dominating in productivity and operating systems software, the scale and consequences of its licensing decisions are extraordinary,\u201d the group said.  \nThe FTC has demanded a broad range of detailed information from Microsoft, Bloomberg reported earlier on Wednesday.  \n  \nUntil now, Microsoft has been somewhat of an exception to U.S. antitrust regulators\u2019 recent campaign against allegedly anticompetitive practices at Big Tech companies.  \n  \nFacebook owner Meta Platforms, Apple, and\u00a0Amazon.com\u00a0Inc. have all been accused by the U.S. of unlawfully maintaining monopolies.  \n  \nAlphabet\u2019s Google is facing two lawsuits, including one where a judge found it unlawfully thwarted competition among online search engines.  \n  \nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella testified at Google\u2019s trial, saying the search giant was using exclusive deals with publishers to lock up content used to train artificial intelligence.  \n  \nIt is unclear whether Trump will ease up on Big Tech, whose first administration launched several Big Tech probes. JD Vance, the incoming vice president, has expressed concern about the power the companies wield over public discourse.  \n  \nStill, Microsoft has benefited from Trump policies in the past.  \n  \nIn 2019, the Pentagon awarded it a $10 billion cloud computing contract that Amazon had widely been expected to win. Amazon later alleged that Trump exerted improper pressure on military officials to steer the contract away from its Amazon Web Services unit.\n\nSource: [https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/27/microsoft-faces-wide-ranging-us-antitrust-probe.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/27/microsoft-faces-wide-ranging-us-antitrust-probe.html)",

    "title": "Deep dive into Kering - From Timber to Gucci: A Legacy of Acquisitions",
    "selftext": "**1.0 Introduction**\n\nLet\u2019s start with a fun fact. Kering, the company that owns brands like Gucci, Yves Saint Laurent, Balenciaga, Bottega Veneta, and Alexander McQueen, started as a\u00a0**timber-trading company**.\n\nAlthough it started back in 1962 and operated in a different industry, its DNA and management style haven\u2019t changed much.\n\nAs I\u2019m writing this, its share price is\u00a0**down over 70%**\u00a0from its peak back in August 2021 that was elevated due to the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\n  \n**2.0 The journey from timber to luxury**\n\n***2.1 The timber period (1962 - 1988)***\n\nThe company was founded in France by Fran\u00e7ois Pinault back in 1962 with a 100,000 francs loan from the bank. The business grew rapidly by\u00a0**acquiring**\u00a0many failing local timber traders in France, especially in the 1980s. By 1988, it owned 180 companies and 33 factories.\n\n***2.2 The switch from timber to retail to luxury (1988 - 2013 - present)***\n\nIn 1988, it was listed on the Paris Stock Exchange and the first transformation from timber to retail started:\n\n* It merged with CFAO (A French distribution conglomerate)\n* Acquired Conforama (French furniture retailer)\n* Acquired Printemps (Department stores)\n* Acquired 54% of La Redoute (French mail-order shopping retailer)\n* Acquired Finac (French bookstore, multimedia, and electronics retailer)\n\nThe transformation from retail to luxury started in 1999 when it acquired 42% of\u00a0**Gucci Group,**\u00a0100% of\u00a0**Boucheron,**\u00a0and 100% of\u00a0**Yves Saint Laurent.** Today, Gucci accounts for 47% of its revenue.\n\nFran\u00e7ois-Henri Pinault, the son of the founder Fran\u00e7ois Pinault, became general manager of the company in 2003, and CEO in 2005. Under his leadership, the acquisitions in the luxury space continued.\n\nIt is important to note the divestments of their previous acquisitions (Conforama, Le Printemps, CFAO, and Fnac).\n\nIts portfolio is quite diversified and includes:\n\n* High-end clothing\n* Footwear\n* Handbags and leather goods\n* Sunglasses and eyewear\n* Scarves & other fashion accessories\n* Jewelry\n* Fragrances (due to the Creed acquisition)\n* Cosmetics (in early stage)\n* Watches\n\nIt is also geographically diversified:\n\n* **APAC (excl. Japan)**: 32% of revenue\n* **Western Europe**: 28% of revenue\n* **North America**: 23% of revenue\n* **Japan**: 8% of revenue\n* **Rest of the World**: 9% of revenue\n\n**3.0 Historical financial performance**\n\nIts revenue increased from \u20ac15.9 billion in 2019, to \u20ac20.4 billion in 2022, and has contracted back to \u20ac18.4 billion as the demand for personal luxury goods started to decrease after the pandemic. \n\nKering\u2019s gross margin is stable at \\~75%, meaning the direct costs are well controlled.\n\nHowever, its operating margin is down below 20% (vs. 29% back in 2019). The explanation is simple.\n\n**Reducing operating expenses is an incredibly tough job.**\n\nWhen there\u2019s less traffic (and subsequently less sales) in the physical stores, the operating expenses remain the same. The company still needs to pay the lease payment, its employees, the utility bills, etc. In fact, these expenses grow over time as there\u2019s the impact of inflation.\n\nScaling down, by closing locations is also not a free option. Not only does it bring penalties for ending a lease contract earlier, but it also leads to losing all the revenue and profitability from that location.\n\nThe company is generating substantial cash flows, but I\u2019ll argue the capital allocation is poor.\n\n||all numbers in \u20acm|\n|:-|:-|\n|Cash (January 2019)|\u20ac1.837|\n|Operating cash flow|\u20ac21.541|\n|Capex|(\u20ac7.772)|\n|Acquisitions|(\u20ac6.559)|\n|Debt|\u20ac4.887|\n|Share buyback|(\u20ac2.034)|\n|Dividends|(\u20ac8.229)|\n|Other|\u20ac25|\n|Cash (June 2024)|\u20ac3.696|\n\nBetween 2019 and H1-2024, the company generated\u00a0**over \u20ac21.5 billion**\u00a0in operating cash flow, or\u00a0**a bit less than \u20ac14 billion after capex.**\n\nClose to 60% of it was returned back to the shareholders via dividends, and an additional 15% through share buybacks. What\u2019s left of the free cash flow, together with additional debt, was used for acquisitions.\n\nWhy do I think the capital allocation is poor? Two main reasons:\n\n1. Almost 80% of the share buybacks were used in 2021 and 2022, the years when the share price was the highest (and temporarily elevated). A good capital allocator can recognize when the price is too high to buy back shares.\n2. Its net debt position more than doubled, from\u00a0**\u20ac7.1 billion**\u00a0in 2019 to\u00a0**\u20ac15.4 billion**\u00a0as of June 30th, 2024. This is equal to \\~60% of its market cap. The interest rate on their debt ranges from 0.75% to 5% and if the refinancing is done at a higher rate, it could significantly reduce its profit margins.\n\n\n\n**4.0 What can be expected?**\n\nBased on the latest investor presentation, there are three capital allocation priorities:\n\n* Organic growth;\n* Shareholder return; and\n* Fuel high-potential adjacent businesses.\n\nAll of it, while having a\u00a0**healthy financial situation and FCF generation.**\n\nThis is a good attempt by the management to summarize what to expect from the company. I find this slide a bit odd for three reasons:\n\n1. On one side they want to return capital to the shareholders, which would position them as a company\u00a0**with a goal to preserve capital and provide reliable dividends**. On the other side, its history is full of\u00a0**acquisitions, which is the opposite of preserving capital.**\n2. The center of the slide points to a healthy financial situation and FCF generation, while its net debt more than doubled in the last 5 years (**\u20ac7.1 billion**\u00a0in 2019 to\u00a0**\u20ac15.4 billion**\u00a0as of June 30th, 2024).\n3. Innovation is not a focus at all. Roughly 2 months ago, EssilorLuxottica and Meta announced a partnership in the smart eyewear category. I see a lot of potential in this area that isn\u2019t utilized (yet).\n\n**Growing through acquisitions and distributing dividends seems to be the DNA of the company and likely what one should expect going forward.**\n\n  \n**5.0 Dividends**\n\nThe dividend per share has been steadily increasing from \u20ac4 back in 2015, to \u20ac14 in 2024. The current dividend yield is \\~6%.\n\nIf the management focuses on reducing the debt and dividends (instead of borrowing to acquire more companies), Kering could become an incredibly appealing dividend investment option.\n\n  \n**6.0 High employee turnover**\n\nAt the end of 2023, the company had 48,964 employees. During the year, there were\u00a0**13,403**\u00a0new hires, and\u00a0**11,275**\u00a0employees departed. At first glance, this is no doubt a high turnover.\n\nThis sounds bad at first, but it is really difficult to decipher.\n\nIn theory, any company that has seasonal employment patterns will hire more employees (temporarily) during peak seasons. Therefore the increase, and subsequently decrease, of employees is normal. This is even more so in industries where the work is repetitive (such as sales and manufacturing).\n\nIn addition, 59% of the employees are Gen Y (1981-1995), a generation that is known for seeking career growth, which could lead to more job-hopping than average.\n\nGiven the reviews on Indeed, Glassdoor, and Comparably, there is no indication that this is currently a serious issue.\n\n  \n**7.0 The concerns**\n\n**7.1 Balenciaga Advertising Scandal (2022)**\n\nBack in 2022, Balenciaga faced significant backlash over their advertising campaign. One of them featured children holding teddy bears dressed in bondage-inspired outfits. This was rightfully criticized and labeled as inappropriate.\n\nThis brings into question the ethics behind those who are in charge of product development and marketing.\n\nIn addition, given how concentrated their portfolio is in the top 3 brands (Gucci - 46%, YSL - 17%, Bottega Veneta - 9%), scandals of this kind could have a significant impact.\n\n**7.2 Preliminary investigation by the European Commission (2023)**\n\nIn April 2023, the European Commission initiated a preliminary investigation into potential antitrust violations within the fashion sector. One of the inspections took place at the Italian premises of Gucci.\n\nAn investigation of this kind does not imply guilt, but if a company is found in breach of EU antitrust rules, there could lead to a fine of a few billion euros.\n\nThe investigation is still ongoing, and no conclusions have been reached.\n\n  \n**8.0 Valuation** \n\nThis is a mature market that will be around for a very long time. Therefore, here are my assumptions when it comes to valuing Kering:\n\n* **Revenue**\u00a0\\- The industry is cyclical in nature, so there will be good and bad times. Based on the past, I do not feel confident that Kering can take market share, so I expect its growth to normalize at \\~3% per year, which is in line with the inflation rate.\n* **Operating margin**\u00a0\\- The luxury market is getting more crowded, and as argued earlier, reducing operating expenses is not an easy task. Once the demand is somewhat stable, I expect the operating margin to increase to 21%.\n\nBased on those assumptions (and a discount rate of \\~9%), the fair value of the company is\u00a0**\u20ac27 billion (\u20ac220/share)**\u00a0which is very close to the current price of\u00a0**\u20ac224/share**.\n\nThis offers an IRR of \\~9%, which is slightly below the historical return of the S&P500.\n\n  \n**8.1 The Bull Case**\n\nThose who are betting on Kering, are ultimately betting that there will be revenue growth and margin expansion through some of the following:\n\n* Revitalization of Balenciaga & rebuilding its reputation after the controversies;\n* Sustained growth in Gucci, and expansion of secondary brands like Bottega Veneta & Saint Laurent;\n* The success of its newly launched beauty division, capturing market share from rivals like LVMH and Estee Lauder;\n* Positive macro tailwinds;\n\n* Utilizing pricing power;\n* Integration of recent acquisitions;\n* Reducing operating costs;\n\n**If the management can pull this off, then the value per share could be 2x from today\u2019s share price.**\n\n\n\n**8.2 The Bear Case**\n\nThose who are betting against Kering, are ultimately betting that there will be revenue decline and margin compression through some of the following:\n\n* Brand mismanagement & more scandals;\n* Inability to revitalize Balenciaga;\n* Inability to innovate around its primary brands;\n* Failure to integrate its acquisitions & further poor M&A acquisitions;\n* Negative macro tailwinds;\n* Inability to innovate around E-Commerce;\n* Supply chain issues;\n* Competitive pressure;\n* Increase in corporate tax by the French authorities\n\n**In this scenario, the fair value per share could be below \u20ac100/share.**\n\n\n\nI hope you enjoyed this post, feel free to share your thoughts.",

    "selftext": "Qualcomm\u00a0said on Tuesday that it expects its push into new markets to generate an additional $22 billion per year by 2029.\n\nOf that amount, roughly $4 billion will come from PC chips, Qualcomm said at its investor day on Tuesday. The chipmaker just introduced PC processors earlier this year, when it released Snapdragon X for Windows devices.\n\nThe latest forecast marks an important milestone for Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon, who took over the company in 2021 with a promise to get past a reliance on smartphones. In fiscal 2024, Qualcomm\u2019s handset business reported $24.86 billion in sales, about 75% of its entire chip business.\n\nQualcomm also said on Tuesday that automotive revenues would rise about 175% by 2029 to $8 billion, of which 80% is tied to contracts that have already been secured.\n\n*\u2033*We have been on this trajectory realizing that the technologies we have developed over the many years can be very relevant to a number of different industries beyond mobile,\u201d Amon said at the investor event.\n\nAnother $4 billion in revenue will come from industrial chips and $2 billion will come from chips for headsets, a category Qualcomm calls XR. About $4 billion of the forecast is a catch-all for other chip sales, like those for wireless headphones and tablets.\n\nQualcomm shares are up 16% this year, trailing the Nasdaq, which has gained 26%.\n\nQualcomm grew rapidly over the past decade as its modems and processors became essential parts for high-end smartphones, especially those running\u00a0Google\u00a0Android. Qualcomm also sells modems and related parts to\u00a0Apple\u00a0for its iPhones.\n\nBut the company has warned investors that Apple could choose to stop buying Qualcomm parts as soon as 2027. Qualcomm said on Tuesday that its growing businesses will more than offset any losses from Apple.\n\nQualcomm\u2019s strategy under Amon has been to use the technology its developed for its handset chips, like modems, processors, and AI accelerators, in new markets, including cars, PCs, and virtual reality. The investor event was the first time in years that the company has given a forecast for those new markets. Qualcomm said its total addressable market is as large as $900 billion.\n\n\u201cWe put a strategy in \u201921, and we\u2019re not changing our strategy,\u201d Amon said.\n\nLaptop and desktop chips are currently dominated by\u00a0Intel, which has over 70% percent of the market, according to Mercury Research. Intel reported $29 billion in PC chip sales in its 2023.\n\n\u201cThe competitive landscape changed between the Windows and Macs,\u201d Amon said, referring to Apple\u2019s move in 2020 to switch from Intel to its own processors. \u201cWe saw that as an opportunity, especially as the ecosystem did not have confidence in the existing players to actually deliver a solution.\u201d\n\nThe forecast for XR headsets also hints at the growth potential of the VR market over the next five years. Qualcomm supplies chips to many of the top headset makers, including\u00a0Meta\u00a0for its Quest and Ray-Bans products.\n\nWhen it comes to artificial intelligence, Qualcomm calls itself an \u201cedge AI\u201d company, in contrast to cloud-based AI that\u2019s typically powered by\u00a0Nvidia\u00a0processors. Company officials didn\u2019t rule out introducing data center products in an interview with CNBC.\n\nQualcomm suggested that its mobile chips will be able to run the kind of advanced AI that\u2019s restricted to large server farms today, an indication that that company may benefit from the AI boom down the road as the technology becomes more efficient.\n\n\u201cWhat you can run on the cloud last year, you can run on the device this year,\u201d Durga Malladi, Qualcomm\u2019s senior vice president in charge of planning, said at the event.\n\nSource: [https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/19/qualcomm-says-it-expects-4-billion-in-pc-sales-by-2029.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/19/qualcomm-says-it-expects-4-billion-in-pc-sales-by-2029.html)",

The company has said AI represents one of its largest growth opportunities. AMD stock is down 5% in 2024 while Nvidia shares are up 200%, making it the most valuable publicly traded company in the world.\n\nAMD produces powerful AI accelerators for data centers,\u00a0including the MI300X,\u00a0which companies such as Meta and Microsoft purchase as an alternative to Nvidia-based systems. But Nvidia dominates the market for powerful AI chips, with over 80% market share, partially because it developed the core software that AI engineers use to develop programs such as OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT.\n\nAMD said in October it expects $5 billion in AI chip sales this year, about a fifth of the $25.7 billion in total sales FactSet projects for AMD\u2019s 2024. AMD believes the total market for AI chips will be $500 billion by 2028, but its total sales are currently dwarfed by Nvidia, which FactSet expects to post $125.9 billion in revenue for calendar year 2024.\n\nGPUs were originally developed for gaming, which is lagging at AMD. AMD\u2019s gaming segment is expected to decline 59% in 2024 to $2.57 billion in revenue, according to FactSet.\n\nAMD also makes processor chips for laptops, desktops and servers, competing primarily with Intel.

Qualcomm reported $33.19 billion in total revenue in its fiscal 2024, a 9% increase from 2023.\n\nQualcomm\u2019s fortunes have historically been tied to the smartphone industry, where the company provides a range of chips to handset makers, including system-on-a-chip processors, modems, and antennas. The company makes the chip at the heart of most high-end Android devices, and many lower-end phones as well. Qualcomm also sells modems and related chips to Apple for its iPhones, and last year said its contract for 5G chips ran through 2026.\n\nQualcomm reported a 12% increase in handset chip sales to $6.1 billion, in line with FactSet estimates. Qualcomm introduced its high-end chip for 2025, called Snapdragon 8 Elite, in October.\n\n\u201cIn handsets we delivered greater than 20% year-over-year growth in Android revenues,\u201d said Qualcomm CFO Akash Palkhiwala on a call with analysts.\n\nUnder CEO Cristiano Amon, the company has diversified away from being a smartphone supplier and has introduced and invested heavily in producing chips for PCs, cars, and industrial machines.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to transform Qualcomm from a wireless communications company into a connected computing company for the age of AI,\u201d Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon said on the earnings call with analysts.\n\nQualcomm has also made efforts to brand itself as a leader in AI, having developed smartphone chips with specialized parts for machine learning since 2017. But unlike Nvidia, the company doesn\u2019t produce the kind of graphics processors for data centers that are used for big AI programs like OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT.\n\nThe automotive business grew 86% on an annual basis to $899 million in sales. Qualcomm says it has billions of dollars in business with automakers currently in its development pipeline, and highlighted it was the fifth consecutive quarter of growth. Qualcomm said that it expected automotive sales in the current quarter to rise 50% on an annual basis.\n\nThe company\u2019s \u201cinternet of things\u201d business includes both chips for industrial purposes as well as the chips Meta uses in its Quest handsets and Ray-Ban Smart Glasses.

    "selftext": "Here\u2019s everything you need to know about SPT - Sprout Social. If you still believe the company is not undervalued after reading this, I can\u2019t help you.\n\n1. In the era of AI, data plays a crucial role. Sprout Social connects to over 30 social networks and processes more than a billion messages daily. This vast data volume empowers AI to generate substantial value. Meta, X, YouTube, Reddit, and other platforms possess their own data. However, Sprout Social stands out as one of the few companies with cross-platform access. In my opinion, considering its current market capitalization, the market is significantly underestimating the potential of this amount of data.\n\n2. Social media is emerging as a lucrative growth channel for companies, prompting them to allocate increasingly larger budgets towards social media marketing. Recent surveys reveal that an impressive 80% of CMOs intend to shift their spending from traditional channels to social media, further emphasizing Sprout Social\u2019s strategic significance.\n\n3. Product innovation: Sprout is investing significantly in new products, particularly AI and automation, which explains the absence of GAAP profits. In 2024, Sprout introduced numerous AI-powered features, such as automatic sentiment analysis and content recommendations. In August 2025, Sprout launched a suite of new integrations, including TikTok listening, Bluesky, and an expanded Salesforce integration, to provide real-time social intelligence to customers. These rapid innovation cycles enhance Sprout\u2019s competitive position and create customer value through efficiency gains and improved insights.\n\n\nWhy the turnaround is likely to happen now:\n\n- Sprout Social announced in an SEC filing dated August 26, 2025, that its CEO and board members will cease their automatic stock sales and transition to purchase plans. Starting in November 2025, there will be insider buying. Looking at similar cases from the past, changing automated sale plans to automated purchase plans often leads to a lift in the share price.\n\nExample 1, ticker ASAN: Change from sale to purchase plans announced on March 8, 2025. From announcement to 5 days after insider buys began: +47.58% move.\n\nExample 2, ticker PLUG: Change from sale to purchase plans announced on January 17, 2019. From announcement to 5 days after insider buys began: +85.71% move.\n\n- Sprout has been executing a strategic shift for several months. It\u2019s moving upmarket and, instead of monthly contracts, is increasingly focusing on annual and multi-year deals. This shift has been successful, as Prout has recently won larger customers, including Zoom, Honda, the U.S. Department of Transportation, NASCAR, and more. The number of large customers (>$50k in annual spend) has grown by +44% recently.\n\n- I anticipate a significant positive surprise in the upcoming quarterly report. Sprout has already hinted that many existing contracts are up for renewal in the second half of the year. This could potentially lead to a major positive surprise in the upcoming Q3 numbers, as Sprout is expected to acquire new (enterprise) customers and renew many existing contracts.\n\n\nRisks:\n- \u201eBut there is an investigation\u201c. That\u2019s for wrongdoing. I think there were 200 cases like this last year. Let\u2019s say they have to pay $25 million - $23 million will be paid by D&O, and Sprout will pay $2 million. Thats nothing.\n\n- \u201eI make more profit than they do\u201c. Value doesn\u2019t necessarily equate to profit. Over the past three years, they\u2019ve acquired three companies. The product has received new features and a significant amount of AI integration. Growth is more crucial than profit, as profit will naturally follow. Sprinklr became profitable too early, resulting in revenue growth of about 6%, but the company is currently struggling. Sprout, on the other hand, has experienced double-digit revenue growth and is poised for even greater success as it shifts towards serving upmarket and larger customers, like Honda and NASCAR. Trust me, profits will follow.\n\n- \u201eHigh SBC\u201c. Yes, this is true, and I don\u2019t like it either. As far as I know, in 2023, they offered their employees SBC. However, at least SBC didn\u2019t increase last year and instead remained flat. Nevertheless, SBC is high, and I don\u2019t like it either. Without it, they would already be profitable. What\u2019s important to me is that they are operational profitable, even though they are not GAAP-based. GAAP-based profit will follow.",

    "title": "Opening Discussion About RDDT",
    "selftext": "Hi everyone, I wanted to open up some discussion on RDDT stock. I think a lot of people are investing for the wrong reasons, have it wrong, or are misguided about the company. I do have stock in RDDT so please take what I say with a grain of salt, but I will try to be fair. Also, I am not saying that I am all knowing. If anything, I hope for some good discussion and to be proven wrong.\n\n\n1. Data Licensing\n\nFirst of all, I believe the average retail investor is blowing out of proportion the impact of Data Licensing for RDDT. It obviously is good to have and is an investment positive in and of itself, but people overstate the revenue impact. In terms of last quarter, data licensing revenue was about 7% of overall revenue. This is obviously not an insignificant number, but the advertising revenue grew 81% YoY compared to data licensing\u2019s 24% growth rate.\n\nThis means that data licensing is becoming an even smaller portion of revenue over time, even though it is increasing on a nominal basis. Another thing about data licensing revenue is that RDDT said they had already entered a lot of large value contracts, and that the following ones would be economically smaller but more numerous in terms of the amount of contracts. They have a contract renewal with GOOG which is obviously great, but it is unlikely going to be anything that dramatically moves the needle. A positive about Data Licensing though is that it is pretty much straight profitability. Also, even though it might not be too huge of a revenue impact, it shows that RDDT will be cemented in the future age of AI and LLMs since you need the authentic human interaction.\n\n\n2. Advertising\n\nThis is where I am extremely bullish on RDDT. The unique user base, the highly relevant content and discussion, the targeted ads, the fact that RDDT users are more likely to go on this platform for product choices and purchase recommendations all contribute into what could be a booming advertising platform. There are a few caveats and things to consider, however. I want to start off with what could be a negative.\n\nUser growth is slowing. RDDT no longer has the new IPO hype wave and wave of news flowing around it, which could have caused a lot more user attention and growth. Daily Active Users in the US fell this past quarter and they have historically had an issue of converting passive logged-out users to active and intent logged-in users. This is something to watch out for. RDDT in the last earnings call Q&A stated that there were some hiccups with organic traffic from Google Search, and user growth increased by the end of the quarter, but still watch out.\n\nThis post is actually getting long as hell, so I don\u2019t want to go on too much longer, but I\u2019ll finish off with where I\u2019m most excited. The opportunity to increase the average revenue per user is immense. New product and dynamic ads, optimizing ad inventory, new ad types, and more are coming. Look into ARPU measures and that\u2019s what you can be excited about for RDDT. You don\u2019t even need user growth for RDDT to be able to increase revenue by multiples (partially joking but it is crazy how much monetization potential there is.) Obviously they will never be Meta, but as the platform gains strength they have a lot to gain.\n\nI am happy to include more based on everybody\u2019s reception, but I hope these points can start off a discussion about the future of the stock.\n\n\n",

This market reaction is interesting because so far, the \u201cbig AI\u201d bets were companies like Nvidia, Microsoft, Palantir, Google, Meta, Broadcom, etc. Oracle, by contrast, has long been seen as more of a legacy play, focused on infrastructure for large enterprises.\n\nWhat we\u2019re seeing is that investors still go crazy for AI, especially when an established, \u201cold guard\u201d player gets involved. Is this an overreaction? Hard to say. Ideally, markets should value not just AI mentions and vision, but the actual value being unlocked. Maybe that\u2019s exactly what\u2019s being priced in here or maybe it\u2019s an over- or underreaction, since we still don\u2019t fully understand what AI will ultimately deliver.\n\nOfc there is lot more to Oracle than this but still im very curiousy\n\nI\u2019m curious to hear your take: are investors overestimating, underestimating, or pricing it just right?

    "title": "Trying to overhaul my IRA and taxable brokerage account with a focus on AI divestment",
    "selftext": "I\u2019m looking for a gut-check on a simple plan. I have an IRA (\\~$80k) and a taxable brokerage (\\~$267k) with Morgan Stanley. Both are managed accounts. Right now about 60% of the portfolio equity is effectively tied to big tech/AI (mag7). I\u2019d like to cut that concentration, move to a fund-only setup, and keep costs low. Also somewhat of a hedge towards AI bubble burst.\n\nTarget mix (household level)\n\n* 75% U.S. large cap\n   * 50% core (S&P 500 or total market: VOO/VTI or equivalents)\n   * 25% \u201ctop-7 light\u201d allocation to reduce reliance on AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, AMZN, NVDA, META, TSLA (leaning XMAG; open to RSP if that\u2019s cleaner)\n* 25% diversifiers\n   * 10% value (VTV or IWD)\n   * 5% mid cap (VO or IJH)\n   * 4% small cap (VB or IJR)\n   * 6% international (VXUS or IXUS)\n\nHow I\u2019d implement\n\n* IRA: start with XMAG only (no S&P/total market in IRA) to cut the mega-cap tilt fast with no tax hit. \n* Taxable: keep the S&P/total-market core (VOO/VTI) and systematically exit all single-stock positions, prioritizing the big tech names first. Do it tax-sensitively with about $10\u201315k per year in realized gains, have dividends go to cash to fund the new ETFs, and aim to finish in roughly three years.\n\nMy rationale for this vs just holding S&P 500?\n\n* Keeps broad U.S. exposure but dials down single-name risk.\n* XMAG (or equal-weight) helps with the current top-heavy market.\n* The diversifier slice is pretty boilerplate imo. \n\nQuestions:\n\n1. Does this combo (core + XMAG + value/mid/small/international) seem like a sensible way to cut big-tech exposure? Not a full divestment (though I'd like to - it's too risky of a bet), but a reduction in overexposure.\n2. For placement, would you park value/mid/small in the IRA and leave international in taxable for the foreign tax credit, or is that not worth optimizing?\n3. Is \\~$10\u201315k per year in realized gains and a \\~3-year glidepath a reasonable way to unwind single stocks in taxable?\n4. End stage I'd like to remove the \"managed\" signifier from these two accounts entirely. Has anyone had luck asking for a reduced brokerage fee or flat/retainer model for the advisors? How would you recommend I broach this full strategy with them?\n5. Should I deploy something similar with my 403b (if the available funds allow)?\n6. Anything else I'm missing?",

Its core search business is going to be disrupted by AI but it is still entrenched and they have the time and resources to adapt. Meanwhile they own the largest streaming platform in YouTube, and arguably the most actually successful robotaxi business in Waymo. If they were ever split up the parts would be worth far more than the sum.\n\nAAPL's heyday is behind it since their growth is anchored in devices and they will probably never acquire significantly more market share in phones meanwhile they have to create a new Fortune 500 sized business every year just to try to keep the growth going.\n\nAMZN on the other hand is not bound by any particular industry or market. They are getting into satellites, pharmaceutical delivery, health care, and can pick any large market they want to address.\n\nMSFT's new leadership after the atrocious Ballmer has brought the company into huge new markets and they are well positioned to capitalize on AI, with a PE of 39 they are not cheap but by far not the most expensive with solid growth prospects.\n\nI personally think that social media is a scourge upon the earth and is destroying the minds of young and old people alike, but META has essentially monopolies that will not be disrupted. \n\nMeanwhile these companies are investing nearly $300 billion in cap ex per year and have returned nearly $1 trillion to shareholders in buybacks and dividends over the past 5 years.

This isn\u2019t a one-off equity play but a strategic bet on owning more of the hardware pipeline for AI-powered eyewear rather than relying on third-party manufacturers [MarketWatch](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/zuckerbergs-meta-reportedly-takes-stake-in-ray-ban-maker-showing-commitment-to-ai-powered-smartglasses-4d4e812d?utm_source=chatgpt.com).\n\nBy embedding itself in the world\u2019s biggest eyewear company, Meta is aiming to accelerate development of smartglasses that can livestream, translate languages on the fly, and serve as lightweight AR companions instead of bulky VR headsets. Reality Labs has burned through tens of billions in losses chasing the Metaverse dream, but smartglasses have sold more than two million units and promise to bridge the gap to mainstream adoption.\n\nThe immediate market reaction was a five-percent pop in EssilorLuxottica\u2019s share price, reflecting investor belief that Meta\u2019s backing will speed production capacity from two million to ten million pairs by 2026. Competitors from Google to Xiaomi are racing to enter the AI wearables fray, but Meta\u2019s equity cushion and deep pockets give it a home-court advantage in shaping design, distribution and software integration.\n\nFor end users and developers alike this signals a coming wave of smarter, sleeker eyewear packed with AI features that could redefine how we capture memories, navigate cities or even interact with the digital world.

    "selftext": "I am convinced that we will probably reach AGI (artificial general intelligence) in less than 5 years, and ASI (artificial super intelligence/ ai smarter than all humans) shortly after.  \nHowever, looking around, it seems to me that ordinary people are extremely underestimating the pace of AI progress and, above all, its capacity to transform the world.  \nBut this has been discussed often here. What I want to ask you instead is: how can I leverage this intuition?  \nThe best way I've thought of is investing. If AI has the ability to radically change the world and replace most jobs, then it will also be worth a ridiculous amount of money.  \nGiving a precise estimate is impossible, but it doesn't seem hard to imagine that an ASI capable of creating fusion reactors, immortality (rejuvenation), and hundreds of new materials could be worth tens or hundreds of\u00a0[trillions.So](http://trillions.so/), I started investing and learning about this world, but it seems to me that most of the advice, principles, and metrics used are useless.  \nThings like the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio and growth prospects are not useful if an ASI is created.  \nEven among funds dedicated to AI companies and among investors betting on AI, it seems to me that they are still thinking with the wrong mindset.  \nIn fact, as soon as an ASI is created, a lot of companies will lose their value very quickly.  \nWhat is the value of Nvidia if an ASI creates a better chip in 2 months? What value can software have (Office, Windows, whatever Palantir does) if an AI can program a custom operating system in half a day?  \nTherefore, in my opinion, the logic for a long-term investment should be:\n\n1. The quantity of physical resources available (datacenters, foundries, power plants, robots).\n2. The ability to be the first (or among the first) to develop an AGI/ASI.\n\nBased on these principles, I believe the best companies for the long term are:  \nGoogle, ASML (creates the machines to make chips), TSMC, Amazon (owns a bit of Anthropic, and a bit of Digit (robots)), Microsoft (OpenAI, servers), Meta (although I doubt their ability to reach AGI first), Intel (foundries), Tesla (humanoid robots).\n\nA possible problem with investing, however, is that we will most likely see a recession caused by job losses. It would be a great shame to invest now and not wait for the probable crash.What do you think? How are you approaching investments?",

    "selftext": "Yelp has been a public company for over a decade now. It makes most of its money from advertising and while it hasn't flourished like Google or Meta, neither has it totally faded. I spent some time digging through the numbers and running  a traditional DCF and here are my thoughts. \n\n* Yelp generated $1.4 billion in revenues in 2024 but growth has slowed down significantly - to single digits \n* Its operating margins are improving - from 5% in 2022 to over 10% in 2025. In my model, I assume margins continue to rise and eventually settle around 18%. That\u2019s still modest compared to Google (\\~32%) and Meta (\\~41%).\n* Revenue is driven by two key metrics: Ad Clicks and CPCs (cost per click)\n* Ad Clicks increased in 2024, but CPCs remained flat. I found that a bit odd, especially since the number of businesses advertising on Yelp has slightly declined. My theory: Yelp is doing some search arbitrage - buying cheap clicks on platforms such as Google/Meta, then reselling that traffic through its own higher-priced sponsored listings. \n* Lastly, Yelp is a controversial company - [South Park once dedicated an entire episode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You%27re_Not_Yelping) to mocking it and there's even a Kickstarter-funded documentary called - [Billion Dollar Bully ](https://tubitv.com/movies/520879/billion-dollar-bully) \\- that questions its business practices.  Online forums are littered with accusations of pushy sales tactics and pay-to-play schemes. Yelp denies these allegations, and to be fair, has never been reprimanded by the courts. They operate in a tricky area of maintaining a \"fair\" review system, so this kinda backlash isn't totally unexpected. \n\nBased on my analysis, I think Yelp is worth about $38/share  - with upside scenarios pushing it past $40. It's currently trading at $34/share. \n\nWould love to hear what ya'll think. Yelp in not a buzzy stock anymore but there might be some hidden value here. ",

    "selftext": "In the world of investing, we're often reminded to do due diligence on asset fundamentals \u2014 but sometimes, the platform itself is the risk.\n\n\n\nI\u2019d like to flag a lesser-known issue for those exploring Forex and CFD markets: brokers operating through MetaTrader 5 (MT5) \u2014 a widely used trading interface \u2014 can manipulate user experience through server-side plug-ins. These tools allow a broker to:\n\n\n\nDelay or simulate trade execution,\n\n\n\nDisplay artificial spreads or price movement,\n\n\n\nBlock or stage fake withdrawal processes,\n\n\n\nMimic connection to liquidity providers.\n\n\n\nBecause MT5 is just software \u2014 not a broker or exchange \u2014 any entity can license it and operate behind the scenes with zero transparency. The result is a trading environment where your experience is completely controlled by the server owner.\n\n\n\nThis creates a regulatory blind spot: a user may think they\u2019re trading the real market, but in reality they\u2019re just interacting with a simulation.\n\n\n\nKey takeaway for investors:No matter how polished the UI or familiar the platform name, always verify the regulatory status of the entity you\u2019re funding. If possible:\n\n\n\nUse demo accounts first,\n\n\n\nCheck if the broker is regulated by tier-1 financial authorities (FCA, ASIC, etc.),\n\n\n\nCompare trade data with public sources like TradingView.\n\n\n\nPlatform integrity is an overlooked part of investment infrastructure \u2014 and it deserves as much scrutiny as the asset itself.",

    "selftext": "**Thesis:** The largest mega-cap stocks will consolidate market dominance in the coming decades due to their privileged access to transformative technologies, structural advantages, and capital. Accordingly, portfolios with a bias toward mega-caps will tend to outperform others in the medium-to-long term.\n\n**Argument:**\n\n1. **The Trend Has Already Started.** Over the past ~5 years, U.S. mega-cap stocks have dramatically outperformed the broader market. For instance, the Magnificent Seven have collectively driven the majority of gains in the U.S. equities market (MAGS returned ~103% over past 5 years while QQQ returned ~60% and SPY returned ~41%\u2014and the returns of Nasdaq and S&P would be significantly lower if MAGS\u2019s returns were excluded). *Naturally, past performance is not a meaningful indicator of future performance under normal circumstances.* But I argue we are *not* in normal circumstances, and this trend is not a short-term anomaly. Rather, reflects deeper structural forces that are to likely persist, and even intensify.\n\n2. **Entrenched Scale Advantages in the AI Age.** AI rewards scale, and the advantage of mega-caps in this respect is becoming deeply entrenched. Microsoft, for instance, has invested tens of billions into OpenAI. Google, Meta, and Amazon are pouring many billions into their own models. These giants have their sights set on owning the entire AI infrastructure, platforms, and ecosystems over coming decades. What will stop them from doing so?\n\n3. **Data/Distribution Moats Will Be Unbridgeable.** The largest mega-caps today are comparable to old giants like Standard Oil. Standard Oil\u2019s unparalleled control of oil enabled it to dominate the energy market in the late 1800s\u2013early 1900s, gaining a near-monopoly and quickly becoming the largest corporation in the U.S. (Standard was dissolved by order of SCOTUS in 1911, but such an ending for the giants of today seems unlikely; we\u2019ve grown tolerant of monopolies.) *Data is the new oil, and the largest mega-caps own the wells.* These companies control consumer platforms and cloud services that generate massive data: e.g. Google Search, YouTube, Amazon e-commerce, Facebook, Instagram, etc. Further, they control distribution channels \u2014 operating systems, browsers, cloud platforms. The long term value of these advantages is hard to overstate.\n\n4. **Index Weighting and Capital Flows Feedback Loop.** Passive investing and index weighting dynamics favor the largest companies. As more capital flows into index funds and ETFs, those companies\u2019 prices rise, and their index weight increases, leading to more inflows, which further inflates prices (\u201cpassive momentum\u201d feedback loop). *This self-reinforcing cycle will contribute to the growing concentration of wealth in the largest mega-cap equities, accelerating the advantages they already have, boosting R&D investment, and facilitating their ability to acquire any companies that would compete with them.*\n\n5. **As Result, Portfolios Tilting Mega-Cap Will OutPerform.** My argument, then, is that in the coming years and decades, it seems like portfolios that *tilt toward the largest mega-cap stocks* are likely to *outperform* the portfolios lacking such a tilt.\n\n**Please destroy my argument with logic. I\u2019d love to understand why I am wrong.**\n\nThank you for reading and engaging. God bless.",

VT: ~6.1%\n\n\nIt\u2019s not like investing in Meta, Apple, Google, and Amazon is unheard of, they already make a huge part of all ETFs you come across that measure commonly used domestic indexes.

($BRKR), and The Trade Desk ($TTD). I believe that each of these companies are showing strong long-term fundamentals, but are trading well below intrinsic value.\u00a0\n\n**Novo Nordisk ($NVO)**\n\nThis is a classic case of \u201cshort term fear, long term value\u201d. Novo Nordisk is a global leader in GLP-1\u2013based treatments for diabetes and obesity, with drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy. Despite continued double-digit revenue and earnings growth, the stock has dropped over 50% YTD. This is primarily due to concerns over market share gains by Eli Lilly and others, short-term supply constraints, and fears of margin compression. These concerns, while not unfounded, appear significantly overblown relative to the company\u2019s long-term fundamentals.\n\nCrucially, the GLP-1 market is not a winner-takes-all market. The market is expanding rapidly and I believe they can support multiple dominant players. Novo still holds best-in-class margins (>35%), a robust product pipeline (e.g. CagriSema), and global distribution infrastructure. The obesity therapeutics market is forecast to exceed $130B by 2030, meaning even a modestly declining market share can still translate into absolute revenue and profit growth. Therefore, I believe the current sentiment-driven pricing creates a clear mispricing where fair value lies in the $110\u2013$140 range. Novo is a high-quality compounder caught in a temporary dislocation. Not a value trap, but a classic contrarian long. The strategic collaboration with Hims & Hers ($HIMS) and CVS ($CVS) may be a catalyst for the price to rebound quickly.\n\n**Bruker Corp. ($BRKR)**\n\nBruker Corp. builds advanced scientific instruments used in life sciences and materials research, including cancer diagnostics and drug development. Despite growing revenue by 13.6% in 2024 and maintaining strong free cash flow, the stock has dropped over 50% since late 2024. The decline stems from short-term margin pressure, weakness in China/biopharma demand, and costs tied to a strategic reorganization aimed at scaling operations and unlocking long-term efficiencies.\n\nThis reorganization, including several acquisitions, temporarily weighs on margins, but positions Bruker for stronger profitability over time. I believe that the market is mispricing this short-term transition as a structural decline. Insiders and Michael Burry seem to think so as well, as they have initiated positions in the last months. With the stock trading at attractive multiples (compared to hystorical multiples and its peers) and core markets like proteomics still expanding, Bruker looks undervalued. With forward EPS of around $2.70 and an average P/E-ratio of around 30, a re-rating toward $80 is likely if margins rebound and sentiment shifts.\n\n**The Trade Desk ($TTD)**\n\nThe Trade Desk is a leading independent demand-side platform (DSP) enabling advertisers to allocate digital ad budgets effectively, with a strong presence in connected TV, retail media, and cookieless identity solutions through its UID2.0 framework. The stock has fallen over 60% from around $140 in late 2024 to $53 as of now. This is due to weaker-than-expected forward guidance, delays in launching its AI-based platform Kokai, and a broader market rotation away from high-multiple tech stocks.\n\nHowever, the sell-off seems a major overreaction of the market. The company remains highly profitable, continues growing revenue at 20%+ annually, generates strong free cash flow, and maintains incredible customer retention rates of >95%. Secular tailwinds in streaming and privacy-focused ad tech support long-term demand for its platform. The market seems to be mispricing a temporary slowdown as a structural decline. Based on their growth, their postion as market leader, and hystorical multiples, I believe the fair value to be at least $100 in the short term. This feels just like Meta ($META) at $90 in 2022.",

    "title": "Are we heading into another lost decade?",
    "selftext": "In my last\u00a0[post](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1j9ygro/remembering_stock_market_crash_of_2022/), I argued that periods of fear during market corrections are often exaggerated and that markets generally recover over time. This sparked a lot of discussion, with valid concerns that this time might actually be different. Interest rates are high. Stock prices seem expensive. There\u2019s talk of recession, tariffs, geopolitical uncertainty, and massive government debt. Investors are rightly asking:\u00a0**Are we heading for a lost decade?**\n\nSo I did some research and sharing my conclusion below. This is based on my understanding, and would appreciate feedback and different perspectives.\n\nFor most investors, the thought of spending ten years in a market that goes nowhere is unsettling. But it's entirely possible and has happened before multiple times. Certain eras in market history earned the nickname \u201clost decade\u201d because stock prices failed to sustainably recover for 10 years or more. The most notable and often cited examples are:\n\n* **Great Depression of 1929:**\u00a0Stocks collapsed nearly 90%, and the economy fell apart. The market didn\u2019t recover for decades. It took massive government spending during World War II to reignite growth.\n* **The Stagflation \u201870s:**\u00a0Inflation soared past 14%, oil shocks rocked the global economy, and interest rates were pushed up to 20%. The result? Stocks barely moved for a decade, losing purchasing power to inflation.\n* **The Dot-Com Bust & Financial Crisis (2000-2010):**\u00a0First, the dot-com bubble popped, wiping out overvalued tech stocks. Then, just as the market started recovering, the 2008 financial crisis hit, dragging the economy into a deep recession. It took more than a decade for markets to fully recover.\n* **Japan\u2019s Lost Decades (1989-Present):**\u00a0The worst example of all. In the late 1980s, Japan was the hottest economy in the world\u2014until a massive asset bubble popped. Stocks crashed, real estate values collapsed, and economic growth never fully returned. More than 30 years later, Japan\u2019s stock market has just begun to surpass it\u2019s all time high reached in 1989.\n\n# While these periods had different triggers and circumstances, they all shared a few common characteristics:\n\n1. **High stock market valuations at the start.**\u00a0When investors pay too much for stocks, future returns tend to be disappointing, even if the economy grows.\n2. **Debt was excessive.**\u00a0Whether it was households, corporations, or governments, excessive borrowing created major financial drag.\n3. **Big economic disruptions followed.**\u00a0Inflation in the \u201870s, a financial system breakdown in the 2000s, and deflation in Japan\u2014each one created a decade of stagnation\n4. **Government responses often made things worse.**\u00a0Central banks and policymakers either moved too slowly or responded in ways that prolonged economic pain.\n5. **Long-term structural drags slowed recoveries.**\u00a0Aging populations, slowing workforce growth, and weak productivity made it harder for economies to bounce back.\n\n**Now, let\u2019s compare that to today.**\n\n* **Stock market valuations are high, but not in bubble territory.**\u00a0The S&P 500\u2019s valuation is elevated, much like before the 2000s lost decade. The current Schiller P/E ratio (price to cyclically adjusted earnings) is well above the historical average. But today\u2019s leading companies\u2014Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Alphabet, Meta \u2014are highly profitable and are driving real earnings growth, unlike the speculative tech stocks of 2000.\n* **Inflation is cooling but remains higher than ideal.**\u00a0Unlike the 1970s, where inflation spiraled out of control going as high as 14%, today\u2019s price pressures are slowly easing and much more moderate (2.8% as per latest inflation report). Supply chains are improving, and AI-driven productivity gains could help keep costs in check.\n* **Debt is a major concern\u2014but it\u2019s not as out of control.**\u00a0U.S. government debt is at record levels, limiting future stimulus options. But unlike 2008, household and corporate debt are under control. Banks are better capitalized, and there\u2019s no widespread financial system breakdown looming.\n* **Geopolitical risks are real, but markets have absorbed them so far.**\u00a0Trade tensions between the U.S. and China, ongoing wars, and the shift toward deglobalization continue to be key risks.\n* **Demographics are a mixed bag.**\u00a0The U.S. workforce is aging (Avg age. 39), but still younger than Japan during early 2000s (Avg age 48). Immigration and higher workforce participation rates still give the economy more resilience than Japan or Europe.\n* **The biggest wildcard is AI and automation.**\u00a0A hopeful difference today is the pace of technological innovation. The late 1920s had new tech (radio, automobiles) but the Depression cut investment in them. The 1970s paradoxically saw relatively slow productivity growth (despite the IT revolution being on the horizon, its benefits weren\u2019t felt until the 1980s\u201390s). Today, we\u2019re on the cusp of another tech-driven productivity boom \u2013 chiefly due to artificial intelligence and automation. If AI can boost efficiency significantly, it could raise economic growth in the latter part of this decade. Goldman Sachs\u00a0predicts\u00a0generative AI could eventually lift GDP by \\~7% over a decade. Such a boost would be a stark difference from past lost decades, which generally lacked a positive productivity shock to offset their drags. Right now a lot of it seems hype. But if AI delivers on its promise without displacing jobs at large scale, it can lead to an unprecedented boom and a period of huge wealth creation.\n\n**So while there are risks, this is not the same setup as past lost decades.**\n\nWhile history never repeats exactly, it does rhyme. Today we see echoes of past pre-crisis extremes \u2013 high stock valuations and heavy debts \u2013 combined with new challenges like aging demographics and geopolitical shifts.\u00a0**However, we also see crucial differences: inflation is being actively managed (not runaway as in the \u201970s), our financial system (banks and corporates) is more robust than before the 2008 crisis, and potential growth drivers (AI, etc.) could emerge to surprise on the upside**.\n\nInstead of lost decade,\u00a0**we appear to be headed towards a muddled decade**\u00a0\u2014 some ups, some downs, growth in some specific sectors, and at least some modest growth, even if lower than previous decade.\n\nOf course, this can change as events play out in the world in coming months and years. There may be major natural disasters that disrupt global supply chains or something else. But as things stand now, the more probable outcome is a decade of lower returns than previous decade rather than complete stagnation.\n\n**What does it mean for you?** Investors who expect 10-12% annual returns just through index investing, like in the 2010s, may be disappointed.\u00a0But those who adapt\u2014focusing on quality companies, dividends, and emerging growth areas like AI\u2014could still emerge out wealthier and stronger.",

    "title": "The Special Case for $RDDT",
    "selftext": "Reddit is one of the premier social media apps out there with a cheap valuation (never judge a growth stock by P/E) for its growth trajectory.\n\nLet's start with the fundamentals:\n\n1. 2024 YE it had a 90.5% gross profit percentage, revenue grew by 62% (NVIDIA like growth??) and it became FCF positive. Next quarter revenue will be growing at 50% to ultimately end at 40% YoY based on guidance. I've been following $RDDT for quite some time and there is always a beat on revenue AND guidance versus what they expected so you can say there is a little bit of conservatism in this numbers.\n2. From a balance sheet perspective it only has $26.7mm of debt. This company generated $215mm in FCF this year and is forecast to double to $520mm by next year. Capex spend is only 2% of its revenue. This companies management loves to run things efficiently and as cheaply as possible. On going concern is not an issue.\n3. The company is already EPS positive and will turn EPS positive on a YoY basis by 2025 YE. If you look at it from a PEG perspective, it is trading at 0.74 for 2026. Anything below 1 is cheap. The only reason you see negative EPS is because the company has been expensing stock based compensation (US GAAP) requirement each quarter. This has ended in 2024, that is why you see major acceleration in EPS growth QoQ moving forward.\n4. Share dilution is very minimal. A lot of growth companies like to pay employees in stock to attract talent, but that is not what reddit does. Diluated shares outstanding actually fell 1% QoQ. This is great for any share holder.\n5. Reddit data is a gold mine. Google pays Reddit $66mm a year for data licensing. This has 85% operating margin - so you need to remember Reddits profitability isn't going away anytime soon because you are starting from a high point.\n6. Insider trading has popped up this weekend after the crazy drop. That is a significant buy signal.\n7. From a multiple standpoint, price to sales, revenue etc it has gotten cheaper despite the stock increasing in value. Reddit user growth has exploded over time, with 50% international base and is becoming a hit globally. Reddit's top 15 advertisers spent 50% more YoY and international ad revenue grew by 77%.\n\n\\- THIS IS IMPORTANT. If US were to go slow down, the international piece provides a buffer on revenue for the company.\n\n8) Advertising approach is incredibly unique. Reddit offers companies the ability to have AMAs to offer product information. I've personally seen this in my time using this reddit. Each subreddit is highly specialized which makes advertising that much easier. People pay Meta and Google top dollar because they are able to use statistical AI inference to generate ad campaigns well. Reddit doesn't need that. If you sell bikes, there's a laundry list of bike subreddits you can target. This is the future as Ad targeting improves on Reddit.\n\nDownside / Bear bases:\n\n1. Highly dependent on Google search. Google search was the reason that Reddit fell after earnings because of the average daily user count fell. Management has said this happens often in its existence and they worked quickly to get back on top of user searches. Management was largely dismissive of this because of their experience and noted higher levels of people asking questions and typing reddit at the end into google.\n2. AI Capex slows down. This will erode profitability on the company, but given how \"clean\" reddit data is, this is the least of my concerns.\n3. Execution and ad platform growth. Growing is expensive, and if Reddit adopts a spend what you can to get it done it will have investors fearful. Based on their CFO's commentary this is not very likely because how they approach things and history shows.\n4. User growth slows down. This is highly possible, but I do believe the international side of things will be a buffer on user growth.\n\nHaving said all of this, my PT is $250 for the company. This is an absolute long term hold.\n\nAny dips should be bought and even though Reddit looks expensive at face value, it really isn't. It trades at 50x forward earnings with 50% YoY growth and a net profitability that will approach 30+%. People are paying almost triple for Palantir and other software stocks out there.",

They have had a lot of volatility and a lot of downfalls. (If you look back and zoom out it just doesn\\*t look like this stock has fallen a lot during some periods)\n\nFor me it makes sense to invest more into Reddit if it will become a winner stock like this for example which has huge falls but the sucess is in a long term uptrend.\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpreview.redd.it%2Fwhy-will-rddt-not-become-the-next-pins-twtr-snap-or-other-v0-pvd2qkmoaqoe1.png%3Fwidth%3D1320%26format%3Dpng%26auto%3Dwebp%26s%3D673bcaec6432c54e161ecde087594e450c5c3dfd](https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpreview.redd.it%2Fwhy-will-rddt-not-become-the-next-pins-twtr-snap-or-other-v0-pvd2qkmoaqoe1.png%3Fwidth%3D1320%26format%3Dpng%26auto%3Dwebp%26s%3D673bcaec6432c54e161ecde087594e450c5c3dfd)\n\nAnd yea, I know Reddit is now also making 15% of its revenue with AI deals with Google and OpenAI. This is of course nice and great, but ads will still be the main revenue stream for the next 5 years. The Ai deals are overhyped. Most Ais just keep scraping it and there is almost nothing reddit can do to limit scraping. it will still be cheaper to just scrape it then to make a deal with Reddit unless you are a giant company like Google or ClosedAi chatgpt\n\nAnd yea, Onlyfans and Patreon paywall content has huge potential and will be great, but most users are still used to not pay for anything on the internet and will also not do so in the next years. Just look at\u00a0[https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/)\n\nBy the way, the\u00a0[r/Piracy](https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/)\u00a0sub has been growing massivly over the past few months. Just recently cracked the 2 Mio subscriber and now already at 2.1 Mio users.\n\nTwitter (before Elon bought it)\n\nOf course you could earn lots of money with Twitter, but only with good timing. For example if you would have bought in 2014 at 45 or even 50, you practicly wouldn\\*t have made almost any money. It only went up in the last few years, because Elon bought it. Otherwise it would have stayed down there.\n\nEveryone always says \"Oh, it gotta be at least as much worth as Twitter which was 40 billions\" - But this was only worth that much because of the buyout which many said was way way overpriced. As you can see on this chart Twitter was mostly not worth 40 billions. So this argument sounds good but is lacking.\n\nTwitter has had comparable user amount to Reddit. (not exactly the same, but better then comparison with SNAP)\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpreview.redd.it%2Fwhy-will-rddt-not-become-the-next-pins-twtr-snap-or-other-v0-5mspqmdaypoe1.png%3Fwidth%3D1320%26format%3Dpng%26auto%3Dwebp%26s%3D361c4358acffe3f7a2e600ac670da90f7cc61045](https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpreview.redd.it%2Fwhy-will-rddt-not-become-the-next-pins-twtr-snap-or-other-v0-5mspqmdaypoe1.png%3Fwidth%3D1320%26format%3Dpng%26auto%3Dwebp%26s%3D361c4358acffe3f7a2e600ac670da90f7cc61045)\n\n\n\nIf I invest in something, then I don\\*t want to rely on insanely good timing of buying into and when to take profits.

([https://companiesmarketcap.com/pinterest/marketcap/](https://companiesmarketcap.com/pinterest/marketcap/))\n\nRDDTs Marcet cap is now currently $23.19 B\u00a0[https://companiesmarketcap.com/reddit/marketcap/](https://companiesmarketcap.com/reddit/marketcap/)\n\nNow RDDT is attractive because it has way more users then PINS and in all the things which already have been discussed a lot way more potential then PINS. The valuation now seems attractive in a comparison. PINS is not in a hype at all, so it should be good for comparisons.\n\nI am not Expert with PINS. I asked several Chatbots to compare these two and what exactly went wrong with Pinterest.\n\nIt seems that since 2022 the users growh has been slowing down of the monthly active users. Sounds similar. This has been happening to Reddit recently and will always be a huge danger for shert term price also in the future because of too high growth expectations and hype.\n\nMore competition with Tiktok and Instagram for PINS.\n\nReddit is not directly competing as much with these platforms, so this shouldn\\*t be such a huge issue for RDDT. Reddit is more based on Text and like a Forum.\n\nPinterest is just pictures.\n\nThe new ad formats and ad tools which have been introduced by PINS hasn't found as much acceptance by the people who do ad campagnes.\n\nThe strategy of PINS now seems to be the integration with e commerce to directly buy the product. This already has been discussed in this sub here and will also be probably done by reddit in the future. (It\\*s not a priority according to the recent calls) This e commerce integration seems to take more time then expected.\n\n\"**Monetization Challenges**: Despite a substantial user base, Pinterest has struggled to effectively monetize its platform. The company's heavy reliance on advertising revenue makes it vulnerable to fluctuations in advertising spend, especially during economic downturns or shifts in marketing trends.\"\n\n\"**Pinterest**: As of January 2025, Pinterest's global monthly active users (MAUs) reached 537 million, marking an 11% year-over-year increase.\" - I have never know anyone who has ever used that platform, but okay.\n\nThe issue also seems to be that Pinterest hasn't been able to attract those big advertisers that constantly run ad campaigns. Reddit is starting to get more of those big names in and already has been sucessful in this (at least to my current knowledge).\n\nSummary of PINS: Similar problem - growth can slow down - more users doesn\\*t automaticly translate into more ad revenue per user - diffictulty to compete with big more advanced advertisers like META, Google, Tiktok, Insta.\n\nIf I would want to run an ad campaign I probably also would just go to google or Meta because these are know. I guess that most marketing people currently don\\*t see Reddit at the same level as an option to run their ads there, because of lacking features out of the perspective of someone who is used to the great suites of Google and Meta. (I am not an expert in this) This is also a chance for Reddit to copy the same things those big guys are doing to make it easier for people to advertise. This must also work about branding.\n\nIf you look at companies or organisations, in the last year everyone and their mother has created a tiktok account and started advertising there, because of the hype. Tiktok became a name that became so important, that even as an old person you couldn\\*t avoid it. Look at all these politicans posting weird tiktoks. Look at all these companies advertising there, because they hope to profit from the hype. Every institution or politican has a tiktok, insta, even X or nowadays bluesky account. Many even have Threads, but nobody has Reddit. Literally nobody. I know Reddit is a community and not a I follow this guy platform, but this is also a huge reason why not so many people advertise here compared to the big platforms.\n\n\\-Reddit has to also become a name you can\\*t avoid as an advertiser. I don\\*t know how we can get there. Maybe other platforms will get worse and thats why people start advertising more on Reddit for the community and the engagement, because it can be more specific.\n\nSo if we break it down to what can\\*t happen for the stock to suceed long term:\n\n\\-user growth slowing down\n\n\\-expected Revenue can't be delivered because more users doesn\\*t mean more revenue per user\n\n\\-competition with big ad brands (out of the perspective of an advertiser, not of the content platform itself for its users)\n\n\\-short term hypes (you buy in when its overvalued and it never ever goes back to this level again)\n\n\\-stock going sideways and staying on the same level as Pinterest\n\n!! You had a lot of opportunity cost because you could have also invested in a stock which brings returns!!\n\n\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpreview.redd.it%2Fwhy-will-rddt-not-become-the-next-pins-twtr-snap-or-other-v0-o9mpskz4bqoe1.png%3Fwidth%3D1320%26format%3Dpng%26auto%3Dwebp%26s%3D4f59a98e575e70281bc2f6c42ff8722a92559f13](https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpreview.redd.it%2Fwhy-will-rddt-not-become-the-next-pins-twtr-snap-or-other-v0-o9mpskz4bqoe1.png%3Fwidth%3D1320%26format%3Dpng%26auto%3Dwebp%26s%3D4f59a98e575e70281bc2f6c42ff8722a92559f13)\n\nSo, I know this is not well structured and too long, but yea, thats what it is.\n\n# Why will RDDT not become the next PINS, TWTR, SNAP or other social media company that wasn*t able to grow monetization as fast as expected and is not a just buy and hold stock until it recovers?\n\nIf someone can dissolve this only concern then I want to buy a lot (1/3 of all my money).\n\nThis is my crosspost from [https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditIPO/comments/1jbfvp0/why\\_will\\_rddt\\_not\\_become\\_the\\_next\\_pins\\_twtr\\_snap/](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditIPO/comments/1jbfvp0/why_will_rddt_not_become_the_next_pins_twtr_snap/)",

    "selftext": "It\u2019s easy to forget how short the market\u2019s memory is.\n\nStill remember the last few months of 2022. The S&P 500 was down nearly 25%, the Nasdaq had crashed over 35%, and inflation was out of control. The Fed was hiking rates aggressively, and it felt like a deep recession was inevitable.\n\nGoldman Sachs or JP Morgan (don't remember which) predicted the S&P 500 would go all the way to 3,000. Michael Burry suggested an even bigger collapse taking S&P500 back to 1800. Most investors were convinced this was just the beginning of more pain. Even then people talked about stagflation and going into the lost decade.\n\nMeta, in particular, was the poster child of despair. Down 75%, from $380 to $88. People genuinely thought it would never recover. The ad market was dying. Reels weren\u2019t making money. Zuckerberg was \"burning billions\" on the metaverse. Investors wanted him to shut it all down.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t just Meta. Amazon reported its first unprofitable year after a long time. Google\u2019s ad revenue shrank. Microsoft\u2019s growth slowed. Tesla was down to $113 at its lowest. Institutions were slashing price targets left and right. Investors were selling at the lows, convinced things would only get worse.\n\nAnd then... the market did what it always does. Slowly, things started improving. Companies adapted. Earnings stabilized. The panic faded. By mid-2023, inflation was cooling. The Fed hinted at pausing rate hikes.\n\nMeta posted a solid earnings report. Then came $40 billion in stock buybacks. The stock doubled. Then doubled again. Amazon recovered. Nvidia went on a historic run. The Nasdaq had its best year in two decades in 2023. By early 2024, Meta, Nvidia, and Microsoft were hitting all-time highs to reach even higher by end of 2024. Two years of record gains.\n\nWhen markets are crashing, it feels like they\u2019ll never go up again. When they\u2019re at all-time highs, it feels like they\u2019ll never go down. Neither is true.\n\nSo investors, it's going to be fine. Just be calm and hold tight. And if you can, keep buying.",

    "selftext": "About a year ago, I took over my traditional IRA which had been professionally managed for a good while. It has a wide range of individual stocks like AAPL, AMD, AMZN, AVGO, AXP, BRKB, COST, CRM ... V, WBA, WMT (28 stocks and funds) for example, with share quantities ranging from 1 to 20+ for the individual stocks. Most, have really nice returns, but the quantity of each tends to be so small I question whether it would be wise to sell most and invest in a mix of SCHD, FXAIX, SCHG, FTEC, and FBGRX. I've already cleaned up a bunch of small quantity positions, but there are still a ton of them. I reinvested the proceeds into the funds above.\n\nWould it make sense to sell most of these remaining small positions and concentrate those funds in selected ETFs and MFs as mentioned above? I've pretty much settled other Roth and IRA accounts into a mix of S&P 500, dividend ETFs, and growth funds. But this one account remains to be cleaned up and is worth around $135k-ish currently. \n\nI'm not generally a fan of bond funds, but do have about 6% in FXNAX. I've consolidated other stocks I sold into FXAIX and SCHD, about 27% and 29% respectively. And I put some in several growth funds too like FBGRX and FTEC, about 16% between them. So the remaining 20+ stocks comprise maybe 20-25% of the account. While I kinda like having BRKB, MSFT, NFLX, NVDA, META, etc., the share quantities are so low that I wonder if I would be better off selling them and reinvesting them in my core ETFs and MFs above. \n\nFor the record, our current income is from Social Security, RMDs, and my wife who will likely work for 6 to 8 more years. I've been retired for years. The majority of our funds are in different Roth and 403b Roth and 403b IRA accounts. The account in question above is a rollover from a job years ago.",

I\u2019m about 85% equity and 15% bonds\u2026. Note equity included S&P, commodity, gold, bitcoin, stocks.   \n\nHow would you protect against a downturn and manage your downside risk?   Would you sell winners and build a cash position to put into use later when the market bottoms?  If so how much?   \n\nOr would you sell and buy more bonds?  If so how much and what kind?  \n\nOr would you buy puts on the S&P?  Let\u2019s say a long put on S&P - how much would you do to protect your nest egg.   \n\nLet\u2019s say fictionally the overall amount invested is 4 M between all accounts.\n\nThank you!\n\nUpdate :  yes i agree, to many stocks.  I was going to retire at 65 and wasn\u2019t worried about it initially but now over the last 2 years i find myself obsessing over how Meta is doing vs Lamar vs Kinder Morgan, and trying to tax harvest and buy and sell when i can and try to keep up to date\u2026 its a god damn full time job.   You guys have good advice that i needed to hear.  I\u2019m going to speak to our financial planner at work, change my 403b to vanguard target that matches my retirement actual retirement date and not when I\u2019m 65, and i found the bogelhead interesting\u2026 less stress, less checking up less balancing\u2026.  So I\u2019m going to read up on him and his style.   I initially was buffet like meaning 90%-10% but my 90 did not have ETFs\u2026 it was single stocks so i have come a down a bit on those and way cutting those back still\u2026.  I will also stop putting money in and build cash until i figure out what I\u2019m going to do.    \nThank you again ",

    "selftext": "I've been considering shifting my investment portfolio such that it is underweight-Trump and I'd welcome any builds or critiques on my thinking!\n\nIn other words, I'd like to build a portfolio that has lower exposure to the political, policy, geo-political and other black swan risks Trump introduces.\n\nThis isn't to boycott Trump, or to make any sort of political statement, purely out of self-interest.\n\n**Investment Thesis:**\n\nA Trump presidency introduces significant uncertainty, which can discourage investment and increase market volatility. Key concerns include:\n\n* Trade Wars & Economic Impact \u2013 Heightened tensions with China and Mexico could slow U.S. growth, particularly for companies reliant on global trade.\n* Inflationary Pressures \u2013 Tax cuts, increased spending, and protectionist policies may drive inflation higher.\n* Labour Shortages & Rising Costs \u2013 Anti-immigration policies could exacerbate workforce shortages, pushing up wages and business costs.\n* Targeted Industry Risks \u2013 Trump has been openly critical of Green Energy, Electric Vehicles (EVs), Big Tech, and major media companies, creating potential headwinds for these sectors.\n* Crypto Bubble Risk \u2013 Formalizing cryptocurrency regulations or endorsements could lead to another speculative boom, diverting capital from traditional investments and ultimately resulting in a crash.\n* Geopolitical & Institutional Risks \u2013 There is a non-zero chance of major geopolitical conflict (e.g., with Russia, China, North Korea, or Iran) or domestic instability (e.g., Trump refusing to leave office, weakening key institutions).\n* Long-Term Institutional Decline \u2013 The weakening of U.S. governance structures may gradually erode the country's economic efficiency and global standing.\n\n**Counterarguments:**\n\nWhile Trump presents risks, some potential upsides could counterbalance them:\n\n* Markets May Have Already Priced This In \u2013 Investors may have already adjusted expectations for Trump\u2019s policies.\n* Tax Cuts & Deregulation Could Fuel Growth \u2013 Corporate tax reductions and fewer regulations could provide short-term economic stimulus.\n* Tech & AI Dominance \u2013 Much of recent market growth has come from U.S. Tech & AI companies. An underweight position in these sectors could mean missing out on significant future gains.\n* Geopolitical Cost Shifting \u2013 If the U.S. reduces its global commitments, Europe and other allies may increase spending, creating investment opportunities elsewhere.\n* Billionaire Influence \u2013 Trump is backed by major business leaders who could push back if his policies create economic instability. Despite his reputation for being stubborn, he has also shown a willingness to reverse course when politically necessary.\n\n**What would constitute an underweight-Trump portfolio?**\n\nAssume my portfolio is currently similar to a standard 'growth' portfolio and I want to retain a similar risk profile.  I don't necessarily want to completely avoid any sectors etc., just nudge the percentages up/down.\n\nI see two main avenues to adjust the portfolio to build an 'underweight-Trump' portfolio.\n\n*Regionally*\n\n* Downweight US shares.\n* Downweight countries impacted by Trade Wars (China, Mexico, Canada).\n* Downweight countries that are geopolitically (Greenland, Panama, Ukraine).\n* Upweight total international stock ETFs, developed markets ETF, emerging markets ETF.\n\n*Sectorally*\n\n* Downweight big tech (Meta, Google, Microsoft) while keeping AI, Cyber and Cloud.\n* Downweight green energy and EVs\n* Downweight retailers reliant on China manufacturing (e.g. Walmart, Apple, Nike)\n* Upweight energy, commodities, small-mid cap, defensive.",

    "title": "Why Estimates For NVIDIA's Q4 Revenue Could Be Dead Wrong: The Case for NVIDIA's Next Blowout Report",
    "selftext": "TL;DR: Estimating NVIDIA's Q4 FY2025 revenue from the capex of its four largest customers using linear regression results in an estimated revenue of $49.265 billion which is significantly higher than Wall Street's expectations of $38.13 billion.\n\nThis is the author\u2019s opinion only, not financial advice, and is intended for entertainment purposes only. The author holds a beneficial long position in NVIDIA Corporation. The author receives no compensation for writing this article and has no business relationship with any of the companies mentioned. The following analysis has been carefully conducted, but numbers or calculations may be incorrect, leading to potentially incorrect results.\n\nNVIDIA will report its\u00a0Q4 FY2025 financial results on February 26. The consensus estimate for NVIDIA's Q4 revenue is\u00a0$38.13 billion. In the past two weeks, Microsoft, Meta, Alphabet, and Amazon, NVIDIA's largest customers, have reported earnings.\u00a0One of the biggest headlines\u00a0was the announcement that these four companies plan to spend approximately $320 billion in capital expenditures (capex) through 2025:\n\nYear\t|Meta\t|Alphabet\t|Microsoft\t|Amazon\t| Sum 2024 ($bn)\t|39.2\t|52.6\t|75.6\t|77.8\t|245.2 2025 (planned, $bn)\t|65.0\t|75.0\t|80.0\t|100.0\t|320.0\n\nMuch less attention was paid to the significant increase in capital expenditures by these companies last quarter:\n\nCategory\t|Meta\t|Alphabet\t|Microsoft\t|Amazon\t| Sum Last quarter reported ($bn)\t|14.425\t|14.276\t|15.804\t|27.834\t|72.339 Previous quarter ($bn)\t|8.258\t|13.061\t|14.923\t|22.620\t|58.862 Change from previous quarter\t|+74.7%\t|+9.3%\t|+5.9%\t|+23.1%\t|+22.90%\n\nSince these 4 companies are the largest buyers of NVIDIA's GPUs, it makes sense to examine a correlation between these companies' quarterly capex and NVIDIA's quarterly revenue. For the last 7 quarters, we get a strong correlation coefficient of 0.95 (Pearson correlation). Now, if we use linear regression to estimate NVIDIA's revenue for the yet-to-be-reported Q4 2025 based on this data, we get quarterly revenue of $49.265 billion, which is more than $10 billion above the consensus analyst estimate.\n\nOf course, NVIDIA's GPUs account for only a portion of these 4 companies' reported capex. However, given the recent disappointing results from NVIDIA's competitor AMD, that portion may have increased. It could also be that a lot of datacenters have been built now and these costs were already incurred in previous quarters, leaving more capex for NVIDIA's GPUs - and the newly built datacenters should now have plenty of room for the upcoming Blackwell generation. Of course, companies like Alphabet are also building their own AI chips, but\u00a0they are much less cost-effective\u00a0than NVIDIA's Hopper generation and especially the upcoming Blackwell generation. Or as\u00a0Amazon CEO Andy Jassy put it on an analyst call last week: \"most AI compute has been driven by Nvidia chips, and we obviously have a deep partnership with Nvidia and will for as long as we can see into the future.\" All in all, one could assume that the share of capex from these 4 companies going to NVIDIA may have even increased in the last quarter.\n\nIn addition, there are other major buyers of NVIDIA's GPUs: xAI, for example, has also purchased tens of thousands of NVIDIA's GPUs and built the massive supercomputer\u00a0Colossus with 100,000 NVIDIA Hopper GPUs. Another massive buyer of NVIDIA's GPUs has just formed with Project Stargate, which plans to invest a staggering\u00a0$500 billion in new AI infrastructure\u00a0over the next four years. All of this should continue to be a strong wind in NVIDIA's sails.",

    "title": "With Reddit's quarterly results announcement scheduled for February 12, I'm feeling bullish about what's coming..",
    "selftext": "I believe Reddit will exceed consensus estimates. Here\u2019s why:\n\n1. **The Google Search Engine Dependency:** Recent reports indicate that a significant portion of Reddit\u2019s traffic is driven by Google search. In fact, multiple sources suggest that the majority of new users are discovering Reddit via Google search results, with some estimates even placing this **figure at over 50% of all visits.** Google trends data for Reddit reveal that Google searches for Reddit have been growing steadily over the last year and last 3 months.\n2. **Content-Creator Monetization:** Reddit is evolving into a creator-friendly platform by rolling out payment schemes for content creators. This initiative not only incentivizes high-quality submissions but also attracts a broader base of influential voices. By empowering creators to monetize their content, Reddit can expect a surge in premium, engaging content that draws more users and increases time spent on the platform.\n3. **Enhanced Content Creation Through AI:** AI advancements are set to revolutionize how content is produced on Reddit. Long-form posts and detailed discussions, which once required significant effort, will now be easier to create with AI assistance. This accessibility means more users can contribute meaningfully, further enriching the platform\u2019s content ecosystem.\n4. **Improved Content Searchability via AI:** Alongside content creation, AI will streamline how users search for and discover content. Enhanced search capabilities will help users find relevant discussions, product reviews, and niche communities more efficiently, thereby increasing user satisfaction and retention.\n5. **Reddit as a Hub for Product Reviews:** Much like YouTube, Reddit is a go-to source for product reviews and recommendations. The platform\u2019s vast user base provides diverse opinions and insights, making it a trusted space for consumers. This organic, community-driven validation of products can also attract advertisers looking to leverage authentic, peer-driven marketing.\n6. **Increased Advertising Efficiency:** With its targeted communities and high engagement levels, Reddit is set to benefit from more efficient advertising. This is reminiscent of the momentum seen in Meta\u2019s stock performance, where targeted ads and precise user segmentation led to substantial revenue growth. As advertisers continue to shift their focus toward platforms with proven ROI, Reddit\u2019s ad revenue is poised to grow significantly.\n7. **Introduction of Innovative Features:** Reddit is continually rolling out new and exciting features that enhance the user experience. From improved user interfaces to innovative community tools, these enhancements keep the platform fresh and relevant. This constant innovation not only retains current users but also attracts new demographics and interest groups.\n8. **Expansion into New Languages and Markets:** With plans to launch in other languages, Reddit is set to tap into a global audience. This international expansion is crucial for sustained long-term growth, as it opens the platform to millions of potential new users worldwide who are eager to engage in niche communities and discussions.\n\nGiven these multiple growth drivers, I'm convinced that Reddit is well-positioned to exceed consensus estimates for its quarterly results on February 12.\n\n**Long-Term Outlook Despite Short-Term Challenges:**\n\nWhile short-term challenges\u2014such as potential tariff impacts on advertising spend\u2014may introduce some volatility, the long-term fundamentals remain incredibly strong. Reddit is uniquely positioned to be a significant beneficiary of AI advancements, more so than many other social media platforms. The synergy between organic traffic from Google, enhanced content creation and discovery through AI, and a continuously evolving feature set all point to a bright future.",

The H100\u2019s architecture enables AI models to train at unprecedented speeds, while the H800 variant meets regulatory requirements in markets like China. The evolution from the A100 to the H100 has significantly accelerated AI capabilities, with GPT-3 models learning four times faster than before. Nvidia\u2019s market strength is reinforced by deep integration with tech giants like Google, Amazon, and Microsoft, ensuring continued demand for its products. As AI models become more sophisticated and data-intensive, Nvidia\u2019s GPUs remain central to pushing the limits of what AI can achieve.\n\nDeepSeek\u2019s AI model V3 has disrupted the industry by achieving high-performance AI training on Nvidia\u2019s H800 chips at significantly lower costs. Traditionally, training advanced AI models has required billions in investment, but DeepSeek\u2019s approach challenges this assumption, demonstrating that high-level AI training can be done with minimal resources. This efficiency could lead major tech firms to question Nvidia\u2019s high pricing, pressuring the company\u2019s ability to maintain its premium margins. If DeepSeek\u2019s success encourages more companies to seek cost-effective alternatives, Nvidia may need to justify its premium pricing or risk losing market share.\n\nDespite its strong position, Nvidia\u2019s financial foundation has key vulnerabilities. Nearly half of its data center revenue comes from a handful of major tech firms, including Microsoft and Meta\u2014companies that are now investing in developing their own AI chips to reduce dependency on Nvidia. While Nvidia\u2019s dominance in both software and hardware makes it difficult to replace, emerging competitors like AMD and DeepSeek are introducing cost-effective alternatives. DeepSeek, for example, trained its model with only $5 million, a fraction of the billions typically required for Nvidia-powered training. With a P/E ratio three times the industry average, Nvidia\u2019s valuation remains highly sensitive to changes in AI spending and broader market trends. A slowdown in AI-related investments or increased competition could significantly impact Nvidia\u2019s stock price.\n\nFor years, Nvidia was synonymous with AI growth, with investors believing that any advancement in AI would translate directly into gains for Nvidia. However, this perception is shifting. The emergence of cost-effective AI models and alternative chip suppliers, including DeepSeek, AMD, Google, and Amazon, challenges Nvidia\u2019s \u201cThere Is No Alternative\u201d (TINA) status. Concerns about pricing, licensing restrictions, and geopolitical factors, including U.S. government restrictions on chip exports, further complicate Nvidia\u2019s outlook. Investors are increasingly questioning whether Nvidia can sustain its premium pricing in a market where competition is growing, leading to potential valuation recalibration.\n\nThe AI industry is undergoing rapid transformation, with cost-efficiency becoming a critical factor in decision-making. Nvidia\u2019s high-end GPUs have long been the gold standard, but rising costs are prompting companies to explore alternatives. AMD\u2019s MI300 series, for example, offers competitive AI processing power at lower costs, making it an attractive alternative for firms looking to diversify suppliers. Broadcom is also gaining traction in AI networking, while DeepSeek\u2019s focus on affordable AI chips threatens Nvidia\u2019s dominance. As these competitors gain market share, Nvidia\u2019s ability to maintain its pricing power and market stronghold may diminish, forcing it to adapt to a changing landscape.\n\nDeepSeek\u2019s advancements have ripple effects across the AI supply chain. If AI training costs continue to drop, tech giants may slow down their AI-related capital expenditures, impacting Nvidia\u2019s growth trajectory. Furthermore, the shift toward more cost-efficient AI solutions could reduce demand for Nvidia\u2019s high-end chips, altering market priorities from premium performance to affordability. This evolving landscape presents both risks and opportunities for Nvidia. While it may face increased competition, Nvidia\u2019s leadership in AI infrastructure and software solutions still gives it a competitive edge. However, it must adapt to changing market demands to sustain long-term growth.\n\nNvidia\u2019s market dominance is being challenged as the AI industry evolves. The rise of DeepSeek, along with increased competition from AMD, Broadcom, and major tech firms developing in-house chips, raises concerns about Nvidia\u2019s pricing power and long-term growth. Recent market shifts have already led to a $600 billion drop in Nvidia\u2019s market value, the largest single-day loss in U.S. stock history.\n\nIf the AI market prioritizes efficiency over expansion, Nvidia could see reduced demand for its high-end GPUs. However, its history of innovation, strong AI infrastructure, and ongoing R&D investments position it well to adapt. While some analysts view recent market dips as a buying opportunity, the competitive pressures and changing industry dynamics mean Nvidia must continue evolving to maintain its leadership in AI hardware.\n\n# TL;DR: Nvidia remains a dominant force in AI hardware, but emerging competitors like DeepSeek, AMD, and Broadcom are challenging its pricing power and market dominance. DeepSeek\u2019s AI model demonstrates that high-performance AI training can be achieved at significantly lower costs, potentially reshaping the AI ecosystem. Nvidia\u2019s dependence on a few tech giants and its high valuation make it vulnerable to market shifts, while increasing competition suggests that its long-term growth may face headwinds. However, Nvidia\u2019s innovation and market leadership still offer strong potential, provided it adapts to the evolving AI landscape.\n\n  \nShifting Market Perception \u2013 The narrative is changing from \u201cAI success = Nvidia success\u201d to a more fragmented AI ecosystem where efficiency, affordability, and alternative suppliers are gaining traction.\n\n* Financial and Competitive Pressures \u2013 Nvidia depends heavily on a few major tech companies, faces emerging competition from AMD, Broadcom, and DeepSeek, and has a valuation significantly above industry norms, making it vulnerable to market corrections.\n* Shifting Market Perception \u2013 The narrative is changing from \u201cAI success = Nvidia success\u201d to a more fragmented AI ecosystem where efficiency, affordability, and alternative suppliers are gaining traction.\n\nNvidia has established itself as a dominant force in the AI hardware industry, with its H100 and H800 chips powering some of the most advanced AI models, including ChatGPT and DeepSeek.

The emergence of cost-effective AI models and alternative chip suppliers, including DeepSeek, AMD, Google, and Amazon, challenges Nvidia\u2019s \u201cThere Is No Alternative\u201d (TINA) status. Concerns about pricing, licensing restrictions, and geopolitical factors, including U.S. government restrictions on chip exports, further complicate Nvidia\u2019s outlook. Investors are increasingly questioning whether Nvidia can sustain its premium pricing in a market where competition is growing, leading to potential valuation recalibration.\n\nThe AI industry is undergoing rapid transformation, with cost-efficiency becoming a critical factor in decision-making. Nvidia\u2019s high-end GPUs have long been the gold standard, but rising costs are prompting companies to explore alternatives. AMD\u2019s MI300 series, for example, offers competitive AI processing power at lower costs, making it an attractive alternative for firms looking to diversify suppliers. Broadcom is also gaining traction in AI networking, while DeepSeek\u2019s focus on affordable AI chips threatens Nvidia\u2019s dominance. As these competitors gain market share, Nvidia\u2019s ability to maintain its pricing power and market stronghold may diminish, forcing it to adapt to a changing landscape.\n\nDeepSeek\u2019s advancements have ripple effects across the AI supply chain. If AI training costs continue to drop, tech giants may slow down their AI-related capital expenditures, impacting Nvidia\u2019s growth trajectory. Furthermore, the shift toward more cost-efficient AI solutions could reduce demand for Nvidia\u2019s high-end chips, altering market priorities from premium performance to affordability. This evolving landscape presents both risks and opportunities for Nvidia. While it may face increased competition, Nvidia\u2019s leadership in AI infrastructure and software solutions still gives it a competitive edge. However, it must adapt to changing market demands to sustain long-term growth.\n\nNvidia\u2019s market dominance is being challenged as the AI industry evolves. The rise of DeepSeek, along with increased competition from AMD, Broadcom, and major tech firms developing in-house chips, raises concerns about Nvidia\u2019s pricing power and long-term growth. Recent market shifts have already led to a $600 billion drop in Nvidia\u2019s market value, the largest single-day loss in U.S. stock history.\n\nIf the AI market prioritizes efficiency over expansion, Nvidia could see reduced demand for its high-end GPUs. However, its history of innovation, strong AI infrastructure, and ongoing R&D investments position it well to adapt. While some analysts view recent market dips as a buying opportunity, the competitive pressures and changing industry dynamics mean Nvidia must continue evolving to maintain its leadership in AI hardware.\n\n# TL;DR: Nvidia remains a dominant force in AI hardware, but emerging competitors like DeepSeek, AMD, and Broadcom are challenging its pricing power and market dominance. DeepSeek\u2019s AI model demonstrates that high-performance AI training can be achieved at significantly lower costs, potentially reshaping the AI ecosystem. Nvidia\u2019s dependence on a few tech giants and its high valuation make it vulnerable to market shifts, while increasing competition suggests that its long-term growth may face headwinds. However, Nvidia\u2019s innovation and market leadership still offer strong potential, provided it adapts to the evolving AI landscape.",

    "selftext": "As a newer investor coming from the ETF side of things, a \"value\" approach has been my first way of learning to look at companies. I'm thinking more about their story, how they make money, whether they do it consistently, P/E ratio, EV/EBITDA, low debt, etc. \n\nI lurk around on r/ValueInvesting and have gotten some good book recommendations, although I mostly use them for reference rather than reading them in their entirety. \n\nThe S&P 500 was at a P/E ratio of over 100 in 2008 when the market crashed, although there have been pullbacks and recessions with lower P/Es than at current levels. All that to say, maybe the market is overvalued by traditional valuation metrics. I guess I'm trying to understand why many users and even successful YouTubers like Joseph Carlson and others recommend many high P/E companies. I gather that these companies have a sustainable competitive advantage with a lot of growth priced in. I'm talking about companies like SPGI, ASML, GOOGL (this actually seems like a growth company with decent valuations), UBER, ARM, NVDA, AVGO, META, FTNT, AMD, etc.\n\nThese companies seem to have a good moat, great CEO's, strong balance sheets but a lot of growth priced in. Frankly, it seems like one could do quite well with companies like these. I've underperformed significantly (thankfully with small positions for the purposes of gaining experience) picking stocks with what I thought were traditional value metrics, companies like HDSN, JILL, ALB, CP, VIRC, etc. Granted, I don't really feel like I have a circle of competence and didn't look too much into how these companies make money. I'll admit that I was riding mostly on the convictions of others, which I recognize is a major issue in itself that I intend to correct going forward. \n\nSo for those of you who invest in individual companies and have had success, here are some questions;\n\n1) Is it productive to differentiate between growth and value companies?\n\n2) Is it fruitful to look for companies with a 10-15 P/E ratio and other \"deep value\" metrics or is traditional value investing dead altogether due to modern age computing power?\n\n3) Does the rise in popularity of index investing exacerbate irrationality in markets to the point where valuations don't matter?\n\nAny insights are greatly appreciated.

    "selftext": "# Summary\n\n* Nvidia\u2019s 2024 revenue surged by 86% to $113.3 billion, with operating income doubling to $71 billion.\n* Hyperscalers are expected to increase AI-focused capital expenditures by 50% in 2025, reaching $300 billion.\n* Nvidia\u2019s next-generation Blackwell architecture offers up to 15x performance improvements, securing its 90% market dominance in AI GPUs.\n* Competitors like AMD and Broadcom struggle with ecosystem integration and software optimization, solidifying Nvidia\u2019s lead.\n* Analysts project a 50x earnings multiple and a target price of $225 per share for 2025.\n\nNvidia Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA) enjoyed unprecedented financial success in 2024, driven by a wave of hyperscaler investments in data center infrastructure for artificial intelligence. Revenues soared by 86%, reaching $113.3 billion, while operating income more than doubled to $71 billion, signaling the company\u2019s dominance in the AI sector.\n\nDespite such robust growth, concerns over a potential slowdown are misplaced. The global push toward AI and machine learning shows no signs of waning. Leading technology giants like Amazon Web Services, Microsoft, Meta Platforms, and Google are significantly expanding their high-performance computing capabilities to meet the surging demand for generative AI, large language models, and advanced AI applications.\n\nIn 2024, hyperscaler capital expenditures on data centers totaled approximately $200 billion. For 2025, this figure is projected to rise by 50%, hitting $300 billion. According to Morgan Stanley, Amazon and Microsoft are set to lead this spending spree with investments of $96.4 billion and $89.9 billion, respectively. Google and Meta will closely follow, allocating $62.6 billion and $52.3 billion to their AI-driven infrastructure.\n\nThis aggressive investment is underpinned by statements from top executives. Google\u2019s CFO noted that while growth in capital expenditures won\u2019t match the leap between 2023 and 2024, further increases are expected. Similarly, Meta\u2019s CEO Mark Zuckerberg highlighted plans for significant growth in infrastructure spending. Microsoft, too, has committed $80 billion for AI-oriented data center construction in fiscal 2025.\n\nNvidia, with its 90% share of the AI GPU market, is perfectly positioned to capitalize on this surge in spending. The release of its next-generation Blackwell architecture in early 2025 promises substantial performance gains, including up to 2.5 times the training performance of its Hopper GPUs and as much as 15 times higher inference capabilities in select benchmarks. These advancements, paired with Nvidia\u2019s proprietary CUDA platform, reinforce its unassailable ecosystem of hardware and software solutions.\n\nCompetitors like AMD and Broadcom continue to face hurdles. AMD\u2019s MI300X GPUs, while promising on paper, have failed to deliver comparable performance due to software deficiencies. Broadcom\u2019s custom silicon projects, although intriguing, lack the versatility and support ecosystem Nvidia GPUs provide. Consequently, neither competitor poses a significant threat in the near term, with meaningful competition unlikely before 2026 or 2027.\n\n# TL;DR\n\nNvidia\u2019s remarkable 2024 growth, fueled by hyperscaler investments, will continue as AI spending surges 50% in 2025 to $300 billion. With its dominant 90% GPU market share and groundbreaking Blackwell architecture, Nvidia is well-positioned for further success.\u00a0\n\n*Price at Publication:* **$144.12**",

    "title": "Uber: A Great Buying Opportunity In Current Markets",
    "selftext": "**Summary**\n\n* Uber\u2019s stock is currently undervalued due to market fears surrounding autonomous vehicles, but its robust fundamentals and durable business model make it a highly appealing investment.\n* Key strengths include an extensive urban mobility database, loyal user base, and diversified sources of revenue.\n* While the rise of self-driving technology presents certain risks, Uber\u2019s strategic alliances, regulatory challenges for competitors, and market dominance ensure it remains well-positioned for sustained growth.\n* Even cautious revenue and margin projections suggest considerable upside potential, making Uber an attractive choice with a strong margin of safety.\n\n**The Impact of Market Narratives on Uber's Perception**\n\nRecent announcements have reignited interest in autonomous driving. Tesla (TSLA) revealed plans to launch the Cybercab by 2027, while Google\u2019s Waymo (GOOGL) announced expansion into Miami. These updates have led to a nearly 10% drop in Uber\u2019s stock, contributing to a 15% decline over the past month.\n\nThis situation is reminiscent of past market narratives that impacted companies like Google and Meta (META). Both experienced temporary valuation drops due to overblown concerns but ultimately delivered strong returns, supported by solid fundamentals and competent management.\n\nUber continues to showcase impressive operational growth, strong cash flow, and consistent profitability, all while trading at historically low P/E multiples. These attributes, combined with its moat-driven business model, position Uber as a promising portfolio addition.\n\n**Uber's Competitive Moats and the Importance of Strategic Management**\n\nUber\u2019s advantages go beyond its network effects. Its unmatched urban mobility database allows for optimized routing, pricing, and seamless connections between users and drivers. Additionally, features like loyalty programs, subscriptions, and brand trust further enhance its competitive position in a sector where reliability and safety are crucial.\n\nDiversification is another critical element in reducing risk. Similar to Google\u2019s evolution beyond search, Uber has created a multifaceted platform that includes logistics and transportation. Delivery accounted for 30% of revenue in Q3, while freight contributed 11%, generating $1.3 billion despite not yet achieving positive EBITDA margins. These emerging segments have the potential to become significant revenue drivers in the future.\n\nFurthermore, Uber\u2019s investments in companies like Grab (GRAB) and DiDi (OTCPK:DIDIY) reflect a strategic approach to balancing profitability and competition. These equity stakes act as a form of optionality while demonstrating Uber\u2019s ability to focus on long-term gains in key regions.\n\nUber\u2019s management has shown remarkable capability in adapting to industry changes. Much like Meta\u2019s successful redirection of investments, Uber is already positioning itself for the adoption of autonomous vehicles. Partnerships with Waymo in Austin and Atlanta exemplify its ability to integrate self-driving technology while retaining its platform leadership.\n\n**Adapting to Regulations and Long-Term Mobility Trends**\n\nThe adoption of self-driving vehicles faces significant hurdles, including regulatory and infrastructure challenges, particularly in emerging markets that are critical to Uber\u2019s business. While major cities like Los Angeles and Miami may adopt autonomous technology sooner, broader implementation is likely to take years, especially in regions such as Brazil, India, and Mexico.\n\nIn addition, overarching trends in urban mobility\u2014including cost savings, easing traffic congestion, and the shift from ownership to access\u2014support Uber\u2019s long-term growth. Although the global ride-hailing market is already substantial, it remains underpenetrated in numerous regions, providing opportunities for continued expansion.\n\n**Uber's Resilience Shines Even in Pessimistic Scenarios**\n\nWhile autonomous vehicles pose potential risks, competition from local apps and evolving regulations may present more immediate challenges to Uber\u2019s margins and market share. Nonetheless, analysts project Uber\u2019s EPS to reach $4 by 2027 and $4.80 by 2028, resulting in P/E multiples of 15x and 12.8x, respectively.\n\nEven under conservative assumptions, Uber\u2019s revenue could exceed $74 billion by 2030, with margins reaching 11.5%. In a more optimistic outlook, margins of 17% would result in a P/E multiple around 10x, equating to an earnings yield of 10%\u2014a compelling figure for a leader in a growing market.\n\nUber\u2019s forward P/E and free-cash-flow multiples of 21.9x remain attractive given its growth trajectory and low current valuations. With management forecasting strong EBITDA growth and robust free-cash-flow conversion, Uber offers significant upside even if its market valuation remains steady.\n\n**TLDR:** Uber\u2019s long-term outlook remains favorable despite concerns over disruption from self-driving technology. Its diversified operations, strategic investments, and adaptability effectively mitigate potential risks. At its current valuation, Uber represents a strong investment opportunity with substantial potential for long-term shareholder returns.\n\n\n\n*Price at Publication:* **$61.13**\n\n  \n",

    "selftext": "I have been dabbling in the past year with investments, but I'm a very cautious profile. Heavy on ETFs and index funds, and low on specific company stocks. I'm financially a bit of a noob, but am pretty good with math, so what I did is read a bit, don't trust any gurus and just trust the math. I ended up creating an Excel sheet that allows to optimize a portfolio based on Markowitz theory of covariance minimization; which is basically my only current goal: to actually diversify and not \"fakingly\" doing so.\n\nThis requires currently to download each time the .csv files from the stocks I want to analyze, clean the data of empty entries and it is quite tedious... I'm looking for some software that does that for me. Specifically I'm looking for software that does:\n\n\\- Import the historical and current value of the stock/index/etf\n\n\\- Allow for comparison tools: create the covariance matrix and/or Pearson coefficient).\n\n\\- Either import Stock meta-data from ETFs (I'm sure it's the wrong term, but what I mean is the different currencies it is based on, countries and/or industries) or at least allow for manual import.\n\n\\- I intend to make around 2-4 investment windows per year (nearly exclusively long-term investments) and let it grow with time. I do not intend to make micro-trading or any real live stuff, so no need for any kind of indicators for that.\n\n**Do you have any software recommendations that do this?**\n\nI'm sorry in advance for all the wrong jargon I used; I'm not versed in this; I'm still learning :)\n\nThank you very much!",

The goal was to understand how regularity and patience could yield results. I confess that I rebalanced twice, but I can\u2019t remember when exactly (oops!).\n\nThis wasn\u2019t my only investment, and its sole purpose was to see how it would perform over the course of a year. It\u2019s not an allocation I plan to keep in the future.\n\n**Results**:\n\n* I invested a total of\u00a0**\u20ac520**\u00a0throughout the year.\n* The current portfolio value is\u00a0**\u20ac706.80**, which means a profit of\u00a0**\u20ac186.80**\u00a0(+35.92% return).\n\n**Key Takeaways**:\n\n* **Consistency works:**\u00a0Investing small amounts regularly helps avoid timing the market. DCA (Dollar-Cost Averaging) for the win!\n* **Stock selection matters:**\u00a0The \"Magnificent 7\" are heavily exposed to the tech sector, which had a strong year, but that also means higher volatility.\n* **Patience is key:**\u00a0I didn\u2019t touch the investments throughout the year, and that was crucial for these results.\n\nThis was a personal experiment that helped me learn more about the impact of regular investing and how the market can reward those who stick to a disciplined strategy.\n\nIt\u2019s just my experience\u2014not right, not wrong\u2014just mine, and I wanted to share it with you!\n\n**Discussion**:  \nHas anyone else here tried investment \"experiments\" like this?

Here's the key highlights.\n\n**December 30 Balance:** $129,157.32  \n**January 3 Balance:** $134,381.97  \n**Weekly Contribution:** $1,000\n\nThis week was a roller coaster. My account dropped as low as $127,242.76 before rebounding on Friday. I try not to check my account every day to avoid the temptation of panic selling. The volatility can be tough to watch, but I try to stay focused on the long-term prospects of my holdings.\n\nWhen I had my cash available, I purchased more MSTR since it took a substantial dip. I lowered my cost average down to $417.78, which is a realized loss of 18.7%. I will continue adding to this position as long as it is lower than my cost average. I now hold 49.138 shares.\n\nI am also going to explore write some covered calls against a few of my holdings. I do this in my retirement account regularly, but I haven't done it much in my brokerage account because of tax implications. I will post updates if I decide to do that. I would love to generate some extra cash to begin buying some non-tech stocks and diversify the portfolio. As many of you stated last week, I certainly felt the effects of not diversifying when the NASDAQ was hammered in the middle of the week. I like some of the ideas people proposed last week, and I have added them to my watch list. If you have any other ideas that look good for 2025, please let me know in the comments.\n\nIt's also becoming very tempting to sell my LUNR contracts. They are up 650% since I purchased them, but I am trying to hold them through the launch later this month. We will see if that actually happens, or I might sell off two of my contracts to lock in gains and let the other two ride.\n\nHere's an overview of my holdings. The only change was adding more MSTR this week.\n\n**Current Holdings:**  \n\\- QQQ: 101.714 shares worth $52,832.41  \n\\- AMZN: 101.565 shares worth $22,769.85  \n\\- MSTR: 49.138 shares worth $16,690.21  \n\\- PANW: 80 shares worth $14,660.00.  \n\\- NVDA: 100.374 shares worth $14,501.03  \n\\- LUNR Call: 4 contracts (March 2025, $6 strike) worth $6,300  \n\\- CRWD: 10.753 shares worth $3,860.54  \n\\- META: 3.867 shares worth $2,338.10  \n\\- TGTX Call: 3 contracts (February 2025, $37 strike) worth $429.00\n\nDate\tAccount Balance (USD)\n\nNov 8. 2023\t$42,657.61\n\nDec 1, 2023\t$49,538.85\n\nJan 2, 2024\t$55,890.56\n\nFeb 1, 2024\t$64,396.23\n\nMar 1, 2024\t$67,122.01\n\nApr 1, 2024\t$70,912.97\n\nMay 1, 2024\t$71,600.58\n\nJun 3, 2024\t$83,827.81\n\nJul 1, 2024\t$91,752.40\n\nAug 1, 2024\t$91,752.40\n\nSep 3, 2024\t$98,283.78\n\nOct 1, 2024\t$105,701.36\n\nNov 1, 2024\t$115,481.05\n\nDec 2, 2024\t$127,155.13\n\nJan 3, 2025     $34,381.97\n\nLooking forward to seeing how the next few weeks unfold.

    "selftext": "Hey everyone!   \n  \nI am a longtime lurker, but I am hopeful people may feel inspired by financial journey over the last year or so.   \n  \nFor background, I\u2019m an assistant principal at a local elementary school, and my wife runs her own tutoring and education consulting business. Together, we\u2019ve been focused on building a secure financial future while balancing busy lives. This post is part of my ongoing journey of consistent investing. As of November 13, 2023, I began contributing $1,000 weekly to my brokerage account. Previously, I had dabbled in investing since 2021 but without consistency.  I deposited a little extra money here and there, but I wasn't consistent in my approach and didn't prioritize it. This is my story and an update on where I stand today.\n\n**Portfolio Snapshot as of December 2024:**  \n  \nStarting Balance (November 13, 2023): $44,403.12  \nCurrent Balance (December 26, 2024): $131,615.84\n\n**Monthly Contributions:** $4,000 - $5,000 (depending on the number of weeks per month)\n\n**Current Holdings:**  \n\\- QQQ: 101.714 shares worth $53,151.66  \n\\- AMZN: 101.565 shares worth $22,725.16  \n\\- MSTR: 45.279 shares worth $14,942.07  \n\\- PANW: 80 shares worth $14,894.40  \n\\- NVDA: 100.374 shares worth $13,752.24  \n\\- LUNR Call: 4 contracts (March 2025, $6 strike) worth $5,000  \n\\- CRWD: 10.753 shares worth $3,817.20   \n\\- META: 3.867 shares worth $2,319.46  \n\\- TGTX Call: 3 contracts (February 2025, $37 strike) worth $825.00\n\n**Table of Progress:**\n\n|Date|Account Balance (USD)|\n|:-|:-|\n|Nov 8. 2023|$42,657.61|\n|Dec 1, 2023|$49,538.85|\n|Jan 2, 2024|$55,890.56|\n|Feb 1, 2024|$64,396.23|\n|Mar 1, 2024 |$67,122.01|\n|Apr 1, 2024|$70,912.97|\n|May 1, 2024|$71,600.58|\n|Jun 3, 2024|$83,827.81|\n|Jul 1, 2024|$91,752.40|\n|Aug 1, 2024|$91,752.40|\n|Sep 3, 2024|$98,283.78|\n|Oct 1, 2024|$105,701.36|\n|Nov 1, 2024|$115,481.05|\n|Dec 2, 2024|$127,155.13|\n\n**Lessons Learned:**\n\n\\- **Compounding Takes Time but Works:** I\u2019ve started noticing compounding effects really kick in. Some months, my portfolio\u2019s growth outpaced my monthly salary, which is both surreal and inspiring.\n\n\\- **Volatility is Real:** Watching significant swings in my portfolio value is tough. To manage this, I\u2019ve adopted a \"set it and forget it\" mindset and avoid checking my account daily.\n\n**- Stay Consistent:** It\u2019s easy to get caught up in market trends and daily life, but staying consistent with contributions has been the most rewarding strategy.\n\n**Why I\u2019m Sharing:**\n\nI hope to inspire others who might be hesitant about investing. I realize $1,000 isn't possible for everyone - I'm extremely lucky to be able to do this - but I think starting with even $50 a week or a month can be impactful. Financial independence is achievable with consistency, discipline, and patience. \n\nFor transparency, I focus solely on my brokerage account in these posts, even though I also fully fund my Roth IRA, 403(b), and my wife\u2019s self-directed 401(k). We also maintain a hands-off Acorns account with about $60,000. I\u2019ve thought about moving that money to Fidelity but appreciate the safety and simplicity it offers.\n\n**Looking Ahead:**\n\nStarting in January, I plan to post each week to give a closer look at my journey. I\u2019ll share more details on my strategy and lessons as they unfold.\n\nIf you have questions about my approach, portfolio, or anything else, feel free to ask!

Feels like a 30%+ haircut can happen at any moment and Im just dreading when it comes. \n\nSummary:  \nPortfolio is up 193% since inception (Nov 2017) sitting at 595K  \nBreakdown:  \nTsla: 45%  \nPltr: 25%  \nBtc: 17%  \nClpt: 6%  \nAbcl: 3%  \nRest less than 5%: Beam, Clsk, Nvda, AMD, Meta\n\nI think for now im going to either lower my average on the few names im still down or just slightly up and believe strongly like Beam or Meta OR just buy SPY and turn that into Tsla BTC or Pltr only if there is a big correction in those names. BTW my strategy is mainly buying and holding. I've only sold a few companies over the years. Let me know your thoughts",

    "selftext": "After 3 years of investing, I've finally achieved my goal of investing my first $100,000! This was a challenge I gave myself after hearing Warren Buffet say you should strive to invest 100k into the market. *(I know that by now it's inflated to likely be the equivalent of 300k, but that's my next goal.)*\n\nI did this by living with my parents and paying low but fair rent, finding a decent job that pays 75k-80k a year, avoiding fast food where possible, and just being frugal in general. \n\n**Investment strategy:**\n\n1. investing $10 every business day into both VOO and VOOG. *(roughly $400 a month)*  \n2. investing in Tesla when Tesla is low. *(this is 20% of my portfolio. My largest position.)*  \n3. keeping my ear to the ground, and capitalizing on things like meta's stock devaluing. *(Though, I totally missed Nvidia sadly.)*  \n4. diversifying into other promising tech companies, such as Microsoft and Google. *(less than fruitful, but it's still diversified.)*\n\nI think the riskiest strategy has been in Tesla. In the past, it's been difficult watching the stock go up and down, but I had faith in their business practices and ethics. Now Tesla is popping off, and given Elon's position with Trump, this should give room for Tesla to continue its growth. Sadly, because of that, I can't view Tesla as much as an ethical company as much as I could in the past, but that won't diminish it's ability to grow and I see the stock continuing to rise in the future.\n\n**Looking forward:**\n\nSince Tesla isn't going to be low for some time, one thing I want to invest in going forward is in clean power companies, such as nuclear for AI companies. So I'll continue looking into that for future paychecks to go to. Any recommendations are welcome!\n\nMy next goal will be to reach $300,000 invested by the end of 2026. What do you all think? Achievable?",

This approach is considered risky, but I have strong conviction in their relative valuation, defensibility, and long-term prospects.\n\nIn this case I believe that 'diversification' among AI stocks would do more to dilute my returns than mitigate my risks. Particularly because they're all highly correlated and despite its market cap, Nvidia has the most reasonable valuation all things considered. We'll see if the bet pays off.\n\nTo clarify, I am confident in the long-term prospects of Palantir, Tesla, and others, but I'm just not comfortable with the valuations. I may reassess in the future when I have new information or valuations change.\n\nMeta is the only other stock I held onto, given my bullish view on their AI and hardware strategy combined with their attractive valuation.\n\n# Unrealized (current investments)\n\n* **Meta (META):**\u00a0\\+367.97%\n* **Nvidia (NVDA):**\u00a0\\+117.05%\n\nNvidia's performance here is understated since I recently increased my holdings, but it's up \\~200% since I initially purchased it last year after\u00a0dithering for months.\n\nThese returns are less impactful without the values or relative weights, but I\u2019d like to maintain some anonymity around it.\n\n# Rate of return (IRR)\n\nMy annual return (IRR) for this portfolio (Jun 2022 to Dec 2024) is\u00a0**73.6%**.\n\n# Investment thesis\n\nSee a summary of my investment thesis in a\u00a0[previous update](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/17mzc07/15_year_followup_on_buying_the_dip_on_pandemic/).\u00a0**TL;DR:**\n\n>\u201c\u2026AI is another secular trend like PCs (Windows, Mac), the internet (browsers, search, social) and mobile (iOS, Android, wearables). The difference is that new technology like AI can now spread faster than ever before and get used in new ways. Every new epoch uniquely benefits from the past, potentially bending the growth curve in new ways.\n\n>The other difference is that Nvidia has a monopoly position on the core technology driving this innovation. Therefore, the \\~350% run up over the last 12 months doesn\u2019t make NVIDIA the stock of the last year, but rather it\u2019s the stock of the next decade. The recent 3X gain will be a blip compared to what\u2019s coming thanks to NVIDIA\u2019s CUDA (moat), among\u00a0[other things](https://stratechery.com/2023/nvidia-on-the-mountaintop/).\u201d\n\n>\\- [1.5 year follow-up on buying the dip on pandemic stocks](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/17mzc07/15_year_followup_on_buying_the_dip_on_pandemic/), Nov. 2023\n\n# Nvidia's dominance\n\nI'm still working through my thoughts here, but my strong conviction around Nvidia comes in part from these observations:\n\n* Nvidia is\u00a0[founder-led](https://www.amazon.com/Nvidia-Way-Jensen-Huang-Making/dp/1324086718/)\u00a0and focuses on accelerated computing while remaining broad enough to allow for innovation and insight across industries where it can apply its core competencies.\n* It's unprecedented to have such dominance in such a fast-growing, valuable industry while maintaining such a long-term sustainable advantage.\n* This advantage is due to unreasonable investments (research, hardware, software, ecosystem, relationships) over decades, making it hard to copy.\n* AI will consistently make software\u00a0easier to create, thus reducing the moats of software companies and make them less attractive than hardware companies (for now).\n* Despite their impressive growth, Nvidia is still supply constrained, which is fundamentally easier to predict than demand constraints.\n\n# We still underestimate the AI opportunity\n\nMost importantly, we\u2019ve barely scratched the surface of AI\u2019s opportunities and benefits. Even the most ambitious targets underestimate it because the better and cheaper AI gets, the more use cases we'll find.\n\nWe have a habit of confusing the limits of our imagination with the limits of reality. Our imaginations are trained on what happened before, but there has never been anything like this before.\n\n# Final thoughts\n\nI'm still well within the '*maybe I'm just lucky*' phase since it's only been a couple years. Towards the end of [my last update](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1d758m7/2_year_followup_on_buying_the_dip_on_pandemic/)\u00a0I also shared a few ways my investment approach has changed, which I\u2019m still benefiting from.\n\nI expect my next update to be the 3-year update in mid 2025.\n\n**UPDATE:** Thanks for mentioning I should have included indexes for benchmark context. Indexes like QQQ and S&P 500 also had good returns during the same period (June 2022 - Dec 2024). For an apples to apples comparison, the IRR of QQQ and S&P 500 respectively during this period were \\~24% and \\~16%.",

I'm specifically thinking about how some big public incumbent companies will be hurt by it (like Chegg) and others will greatly benefit from it. There must be a number of criteria that can be evaluated based on publicly available data and are hypothesized to correlate with positive financial outcomes in the age of AI automation.

    "selftext": "Hello all, after months of my own research I've made a portolio. I want to preface this by saying this is not a post looking for advice. I am just wanting to tell you all the investments I've made and the reasons behind them. Also, there is some overlap between my individual picks and my ETF picks. I know.\n\n**First, the foundation**\n\nLike any smart investor you need a solid base. Something that will grow steadily and won't make you want to sell out when there is an inevitable market crash. This is why for my first pie, I have gone with 80% VUAG and 20% IGLA.\n\n**Tech Focus**\n\nPeople may say that my portfolio is too heavily weighted towards the USA and tech, I think the tech giants like Apple etc are not going anywhere. So my allocations are as follows,\n\nAmazon- Moving into the AI space with Nova, Revenue growing steadily YOY.\n\nMicrosoft- Almost in the 'too big to fail' category. Not going anywhere and an easy choice IMO.\n\nAlphabet- Recovered well and quickly after 2022 crash. Massive AI player. Easy choice\n\nApple- Still most popular in the Phone space. Can only see this stock going one way.\n\nMeta- Absolutely flying in recent years. Hopeful Zuck will keep it up.\n\nASML- Riskier pick but believe they will have a good year next year. Looking 4-5 years into the future with this one.\n\nNvidia- Don't think I need to say too much with this choice. Looking long term, very excited about this one.\n\nIonQ- Main player in quantum computing space, looking at some volatile years upcoming but I have faith that they could be huge in 5+ years.\n\n**Consumer Focus**\n\nCostco wholesale- Almost unshakeable business model, no strong competition IMO.\n\nPets at home- Smaller allocation for this one. Seems undervalued to me as people are always going to treat their pets. Will keep tabs on this one as still unsure.\n\nProcter and Gamble- Been around for a million years. Very stable with dividend growth YOY.\n\nWalmart- Consumer powerhouse in USA, strong financials and IMO not going anywhere,#\n\n**Finance Focus**\n\nBerkshire Hathaway- Trust in Buffett, no pressure from short term market trends.\n\nIntuit- Dividend growth YOY, in an incredible place financially.\n\nJP Morgan and Chase- In the 'too big to fail' category in my opinion. Involved in so many industries so not dependent on one for revenue.\n\nMasterCard- Very able to adapt to the market, only risk is inflation IMO.\n\nPayPal- After share price crash in 2022. Revenues didn't faulter and net income bounced back within the year. Undervalued IMO.\n\nS&P Global- Adapting well to new tech such as AI. Been around forever.\n\n**Real Estate Focus**\n\nRealty income- Unshaken by the market crashes in past 20 years. Dividend Growth YOY.\n\nVICI properties- Predictable revenue due to triple net leases. In a strong financial postion.\n\nI think I have a good mix of sectors and stability/growth. I am not looking for advice but will take onboard any criticism.\n\nThanks all.",

I ended up selling within a year after doubling my investment, thinking I had done well. However, I realized I missed out by not allowing my winners to ride. It ended up doubling again in the coming year. I still have a strong affinity for the company and I'm trying to find a good entry point for a stock that continues to rise. What should I do?",

    "title": "PM was a good buy before earnings; but why?",
    "selftext": "I just thought PM showed a good example that the price \"fell\" going into earnings and ends up pushing higher after earnings.\n\nI would argue through much experience that this is typical in both directions. I therefore expect MSFT to do similar and META is a bit neutral.\n\nThe rationale is the price is moving against the direction of the bet to increase the cost of the bet. If you know how betting works that's exactly how it works. Look at the presidential election bets on polymarkets - Trump is more expensive to bet yes (win) than Kamala.\n\nHow does price moving down mean a more expensive upside bet? Simple, the price has to move MORE to break even or be profitable for a trader. This phenomenon is OPPOSITE to gambling such as sports betting. Which can be explained by how the payout works, because the payout isn't a pot of money but a share that then has to be sold by the counterparty (a short seller against a long buyer).\n\nWhat does this have to do with investing? I think a lot of people get this backward. They buy a stock ahead of earnings anticipating good earnings (or sell it anticipating bad) and then the stock does the opposite of what they expect for a time, sometimes even a little after the earnings volatility is crushed.\n\nSome people just hold through this \"volatility\" and never seem to figure out why it happens in the first place. But others get absolutely discouraged at timing their buying of shares of their stock and end-up buying in a suboptimal way; such as DCA'ing on the way up.\n\nI bought PM right before earnings because it moved down and I knew that for everyone to lose price had to move up; that is where the \"bet\" breaks even. And sure enough it did.\n\nI like PM as a company, I expected its earnings to be good so I expected that tailwind anyway. But I timed my buy to a price of $114.62 with options.\n\nSo I had a massive advantage going into the earnings purchase to stack my PM shares.\n\nLastly; I wanted to point out that I bought PM very confidently because of pre-earnings behavior that PM would go up even though I think to an untrained eye PM looks \"weak\" coming off an all time high and they would therefore assume it'd continue to be weak. That going any higher would seem \"too much\".\n\nBut the market's cup runneth over regardless how absurd it may seem because of the recent run.",

    "selftext": "hey all, sharing what i'm calling my \"frontier tech\" portfolio, broken down by percentages. i'm looking for valuable input, feedback, and discussion around it. and, if it happens to be helpful to anyone, even better. i do want to clarify a few things:\n\n* i'm focused on AI, bitcoin, and space. investment vehicles or not, i simply think each are tech frontiers that hold tons of promise, are poised for massive growth, and will bring immense amounts of value to the world over the next few decades. let's just call this a \"frontier tech\" portfolio, to give it a name i can reference.\n* i'm not looking for feedback that just disagrees with that thesis. whether you think AI is all hype, or you are anti-Bitcoin and think it's a ponzi scheme, or you think space is a waste of resources, or anything along these lines - that's ok, i respect that perspective, but i'd like to avoid arguing about it. we just disagree about some fundamental things, and you won't convince me i'm simply wrong.\n* i AM looking for feedback on blind spots, poor/missing assumptions, overconfidence, things i'm not considering, or any other constructive input that falls within the framework of the overall thesis. i'm not just looking for people to agree with me (though that is interesting input as well) - i just want feedback that can be applied within my overall investing philosophy.\n* yes, i'm missing some key areas of what many would call \"frontier tech\" - biotech, green / nuclear energy, cybersecurity, to name a few - but i just don't have the same level of confidence in specific areas of those. i prefer to stay relatively focused on the categories where i'm most confident and able to stay up to date.\n* i'm trying to keep my language somewhat appealing to a wide audience. not looking to get too bogged down in technical details or language that would alienate someone reading this stuff who's less familiar with one or any of the spaces/categories.\n* my primary goal is a portfolio of funds and stocks that i can invest in with *strong long-term confidence in growth.* not stuff i trade frequently. and not stuff i love the idea of or that seems interesting / sexy but that i don't know enough about (SMCI, PLTR, altcoins as some good examples). i also generally prefer companies whose leadership i trust and/or admire.\n\nok, with that out of the way, let's dive in:\n\n**30% AI** - 10% NVDA, 5% SOXQ, 15% balanced mixed of NOW, MSFT, AAPL, GOOGL, META, AMZN\n\n* HIGH LEVEL: to me, this category is ABSOLUTELY going to change our world in fundamental ways over the next several decades. AI's potential is not chatGPT, or smarter versions of it. it's far beyond what we're seeing from LLMs today. if you listen to the engineers and operational leaders within the AI space, listen to not what they \"believe\" is gonna happen, but to what they know is coming because they've already used the tech, usually 1-2 years before the public even sees it, these people are overwhelmed, amazed, terrified, enchanted, bewildered. to me, that's just very interesting. i believe what some others do - that we're in the midst or on the verge of another technological revolution. i'm not bothered much that AI isn't monetizing in demonstrable, repeatable ways. i think there's been and continues to be enough fundamental, increasing advancement in this field that the value creation will absolutely surpass what most people think. as for the individual stocks, i'll do a quick dive here. to be clear, I don't think these are groundbreaking choices and many are very obvious. but, seems useful to give my favorite things about each:\n* 10% NVDA - these guys are and will continue to be at the center of the whole thing. their moat is extensive. it's not just GPU / blackwell demand. it's their CUDA programming language and universe, and stickiness of it. it's the long-term horizon required for their data centers that makes 5-10 year customers out of everyone who buys their stuff. it's CEO jensen pushing them and already looking for the \"next big thing.\" just a lot of confidence here.\n* 5% SOXQ - i like this semiconductor ETF a little more than SMH because it's more diverse (SMH is like 25% NVDA, which is great if i didn't already allocate so much there), and it's got a low expense ratio (0.19%). i love this exposure because the AI industry is driven by these companies (e.g. TSMC, Micron, Broadcam, Qualcomm, AMD, AMAT).\n* 15% mix of these...\n   * NOW - excellent leadership and integrated heavily with NVDA tech; will benefit hugely from AI boom with AI-driven automation\n   * META - founder-run and with a clear vision; demonstrating enormous resources and focus on building AI models, meeting consumer needs, being pioneers in tech at large\n   * AAPL - will probably benefit the most from consumer-facing AI products and implementation; strong leadership\n   * AMZN - AWS is a profit monster that will be huge for AI tools and services and data centers; logistics and ecom will be big AI beneficiaries; strong leadership\n   * MSFT - deeply embedded in the AI revolution with its investment in OpenAI + AI integration into Azure and Microsoft 365; excellent leadership\n   * GOOGL - AI pioneer with DeepMind / Brain; they still own search; have enormous amount of data; questionable leadership but I'm holding for now\n* No TSLA??? no. i just don't trust elon musk enough at this point. and i need confidence in a company's leadership for me to invest in its stock. there's a big chance i'm missing out (their robotics division might be incredible), but I'm able to sleep OK with that.\n* i'm also missing plenty of other AI picks. i know that. these are the ones i can invest in with the most confidence.\n\n**30% Bitcoin** - 25% Bitcoin itself (cold storage or an ETF), 5% MSTR\n\n* HIGH LEVEL: why Bitcoin? books have been written about it, but to shortly summarize my perspective - it's quite volatile and risky short-term, and quite growth-oriented and (thus far) safe long-term. excellent store of value. wonderful technology, math/code based, and may or may not upend some portion of the financial system. limited supply that's only decreasing over time. immutable. now adopted by many big institutions. goes on giant bull runs every 4 or so years. some days, it's hard to justify NOT putting more into this one, but for now i'm convinced that\u00a0 diversification is the better long-term play.\n* 20% Bitcoin - many would argue that holding actual Bitcoin, ideally off exchanges and on cold storage is the smartest play here. but there are also arguments for FBTC or IBIT (helpful in tax-advantaged accounts; trusting an ETF seems safer to some - very debatable). i do some cold storage, and some FBTC (they self-custody their Bitcoin, which not everyone does). either way, just Bitcoin. it's the only crypto play where my confidence level is very high.\n* 5% MSTR - this is a leveraged Bitcoin play. strong chance it outpaces BTC growth rate during bull runs. i may shift some MSTR profits to Bitcoin over time if it starts to really offset my 4:1 BTC:MSTR ratio.\n\n**30% Space** - 10% ASTS, 10% RKLB, 5% LUNR\n\n* HIGH LEVEL: the tech for space finally seems to match the potential that's been talked about for decades and decades. for a while, space-x really proved this out, almost single-handedly. but we clearly have some strong other players either in or entering the category. my favorites are these three. here's why:\n* 10% ASTS - you should read the kook report (google it) for a true deep dive, but to hit my high level points: they are pre-revenue but with the potential for MASSIVE growth. effectively, their satellite system aims to offer a global cellular network. think starlink but more b2b and generally better tech. they own tons of patents. they are 5+ years ahead of what many think will be a winner-takes-most race. their partners already include AT&T, Verizon, Vodafone, Rakuten, American Tower, Bell Canada, and more. they have excellent leadership. i find this a risky-ish play as they have tons to still accomplish, but the potential growth is enormous.\n* 10% RKLB - effectively, a space-x competitor on smaller rockets, with a fraction of the market cap and a huge runway for growth. i think still heavily undervalued today. nerdy/awesome leadership. vertically integrated. as telecom, defense, and general research spending expands to space economy, RKLB is positioned very, very well.\n* 5% LUNR - i've spent less time researching them than the other two, but my confidence level in the risk/reward is still pretty high. key player in the lunar economy - one of few companies that can deliver payloads to the moon. very niche but valuable moat. huge potential, good amount of risks ahead.\n\n**10% cash** - ...to buy them juicy dips.\n\nok, that's my \"frontier tech\" portfolio summary. to repeat - this is what i can confidently invest in for what i believe will be better-than-average returns over the next 10+ years. i recognize that this discussion didn't even really touch share price, EPS, P/E, profitability, revenue, or other key details. this just isn't the place where i'm getting into that. i can say that i'm comfortable with the financial metrics and details regarding these companies. but this discussion is mainly focused on what categories i think are poised for the most growth, and what companies/stocks/assets in those categories seem to be most positioned to lead that growth. thanks for reading.\n\n*\\*\\*\\*The information provided is for educational and informational purposes only and should not be considered financial advice.

The network effect significantly applies to digital platforms, dating all the way back to the internet itself. When the internet became more widely used, more people relied on it to conduct work, deepen personal connections, and for research and other functions.\n\nExample: social network platforms\n\nThe network effect is especially prominent on online platforms that encourage users to add other users to the platform\u2019s network. Social networks such as Facebook and Instagram are key examples of the network effect. The more people that use the platform in an individual\u2019s network, the more likely it is that individual will use the platform, too.\n\nExample: E-commerce platforms \n\nE-commerce platforms, such as Amazon, also benefit from the network effect. As more retailers opt to sell their goods on Amazon, the more consumers will look to Amazon to shop. The reverse is also true.\n\nI currently invest in MSFT,GOOGL,META,V,MA.

    "selftext": "I am trying to level up my game, and for a pretty long time I just looked at the balance sheet, a few ratios, P/E, forward P/E, compared these to the industry average, healthy cash flow, debt etc. Most of the time I just did this on well known stocks, MSFT, AAPL, NVDA, INTC, AMD, META etc. basically companies you hear about a lot everywhere, I just had no trust in lesser known companies to outperform the market, even if these basic metrics were promising.\n\nNow it worked out relatively well since I started investing, but I feel like I didn't really beat the market by too much with my stock picks given the extra risk I took. There was a study by\u00a0[Cornell](https://www.cornell-capital.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/2024-Q2-Memo.pdf?_bhlid=91b22f94067500de4f838bfb72c6cdab059cf3dc), where one of the graphs show the % of SP500 stocks beating the SP500, and while the data doesn't go back too much -would love to see one that goes back until 1970-1980 at least-. however for the 2014-2023 period it can be seen that about 40-50% of the companies beat the 'market'. So basically if you stock pick with a random generator you have a good chance to have a similar performance to the market. So I believe with a proper educated research it would be possible to tip the scales in our favor.\n\nSo I feel like the way I picked stocks was sort of look at the most hyped and known companies, have a basic glance on some ratios and the balance sheet, and I feel like this is so bad that it will bite back after a while. I see quite a few people here on reddit and some other communities knowing so much about a company, the moat they have, why it's a good investment, why it would be a bad one etc. What is the proper approach to get information? What sources are valuable? I assume earning reports are one, but I doubt they have all the information of the industry the company is in, why it's better than competitors etc. surely there are some other sources that are used for all this.\n\nAny advice is appreciated!",

    "selftext": "AI investments are proving their worth faster than many expected, especially for tech giants like Facebook (Meta). In 2022, hyperscalers saw their Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) dip as they ramped up AI spending. However, the latest data shows that their ROICs have already largely recovered outside of MSFT, even as they continue to grow their capital expenditures. If ROIC across the board continued to drop as capex has increased over the past 3 years these arguments about AI needing to move the needle may have some merit but that has not been the case.\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/Npft53D](https://imgur.com/a/Npft53D)\n\nThis quick turnaround highlights how effective AI is in driving value, not just hype. Take Facebook as an example. By integrating AI into their ad services, Facebook dramatically improved ad targeting and personalization, directly boosting ad performance and revenue. The optimization of AI-driven ad placements allowed them to deliver better results for advertisers, which translated into higher prices per ad and improved ad load efficiency. This AI-driven approach is a clear demonstration of how AI investments can rapidly translate into tangible financial benefits, reinforcing the high ROIC we are seeing across the board. \n\n",

    "title": "Looking to pick myself up and make a long time investment strategy after years of investing poorly",
    "selftext": "In December of 2019 and somewhere around 2022 I invested about 6-7k each time in a few choice stocks. Since I was younger, I felt like I could totally be an investment guy, and keep track of everything that's happening. Since then I learned that I'm 100% not that guy and I want a somewhat simple investment strategy that I can buy and forget with, for a long period of time (5+ years at the very minimum).\n\nI've made some horrible choices like investing in SVB, TEAM and FVRR, but made some excellent choices (IMO) in META, CRWD and GOOGL. I find that I'm (obviously) much more comfortable with blue chip stocks, but I don't trust that investment strategies such as DCA work on individual stocks so much as they work on ETFs.\n\nI'm a techy guy so I mainly invest in tech. I'm perfectly fine in investing into S&P, NASDAQ and another ETF for the rest of my life, but I already have my pension and another investment fund through my job 100% in S&P, and I don't know if it's wise doing my personal in S&P as well (of course, I have many stocks in the S&P in my portfolio).\n\nSince these 2 investments, I have kept my money in a very low risk, low reward fund that basically just keeps the money from not losing it's value over time. I'm looking into investing it in the market between now and the following 12 months. I don't know how much of my portfolio I want in individual stocks and how much in ETFs. Makes sense to me that considering what I'm looking for, it should be at the very least 70% in ETFs. By the way, does it make sense owning ETFs and also individual stocks from these ETFs?\n\nJust as a disclaimer, I will never just outright do any advice I'm given. I'm a cautious person, and will always do my research based on other's advices.\n\nJust a background: I'm 27, living with my girlfriend in Israel, making about 5.5k net USD a month. I think I can invest about 50% of that each month (on average) considering all of our expenses. My objectives are potentially buying an estate somewhere abroad and retiring early (earlier than the retirement age here which is 67 currently). No debt. In my fund I'm at -18%, mostly because of SVB and a few poor choices. I'm thinking of just selling all of these bad choices just to forget about them, and taking that money elsewhere. Let me know what you think.\n\nSo anyway, I hope I've provided everything necessary. Let me know if I missed some vital information.",

    "title": "Analyzing the Analysts: Using average analyst price target to identify possible buying opportunities amongst the top 100 companies in the S&P",
    "selftext": "Hello everyone,\n\nI'm a lazy investor and don't like to do much due diligence, but I do like to make money. Unfortunately these two things about me are often at odds as I've lost money in the past for not doing my DD. As such, I continue to be lazy but I try and find ways to work around doing due diligence and hopefully finding loop holes.\n\nOne such way that I have been thinking about recently is using analyst ratings, reviews and price targets as a surrogate for due diligence. In essence, I try to just have these analysts do the work for me. An idea I had is that much in the same way that with those who believe in technical analysis hold that everything you need to know about a stock is baked into it's price action, and so when something good happens the stock price goes up and when something bad happens the stock price goes down, thus all you need is to analyze trends in stock price and you'll be analyzing everything about the stock by proxy, I have a thesis (or theory) that perhaps you can do the same or something similar with analyst price targets of companies.\n\nNow I know that anyone who has read this far, already thinks I'm an idiot. Many experienced individual investors probably find market analysts to be stupid and therefor I'm stupid for following their lead, but I would argue to the contrary for a few reasons. As much as I have put in a lot of effort to learn about how the market operates (been investing for the last 6 years, started learning actively about it as much as I could a couple years prior to that), there is still much I don't know as I don't have a finance or economics degree. Moreover, as bad as you may think an analyst is, they are at least competent enough to keep their job as an analyst at the investment firm that allows them to make stock price target selections. Lastly, and most importantly, what I am about to discuss below uses the aggregate of several analyst price targets so I'm not relying on a single analyst but several (probably between 10 and 40 per company). I think if two-dozen analysts are strongly in favor of a company, it is unlikely that my novice investor wisdom would have researched the company and found a flaw that they all missed.\n\nSo what I did yesterday evening was go through the top 100 S&P 500 companies by market cap and find the current average price target for them on Yahoo Finance. I then divided the current stock price (at the close on 7/31) by that price target and expressed it as a percentage to see how far off the company was from the average price target analysts were aiming for. Then I also listed how many total ratings each company had, and how many of them were 'Strong Buys' and 'Buys'.\n\nThis yielded the following table:\n\n|+|A|B|C|D|E|F|G|H|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|1|Company|Current Price|Price Target|Percent to Target|Total Ratings|# Strong Buy Ratings|# Buy Ratings|% of Ratings that were Strong

This lead me to the following 11 companies:\nMicron Technologies (MU), Boston Scientific (BSX), Abbot Laboratories (ABT), Merck Scientific (MRK), Stryker (SYK), The Cigna Group (CI), Broadcom (AVGO), Comcast (CMCSA), Honeywell International (HON), Analogue Devices (ADI), and Intuit Inc. (INTU)\n\nI have about $5,000 I'd like to invest right now and I have half a mind to just put it equally weighted into these 11 companies and just watch it for the next year or two. I'll either do that or put it all in VOO, but I have a feeling that these 11 companies might beat the S&P 500 over the next 24 months.\n\nWhat do you guys think?",

I\u2019m on the side of active only because I know what I\u2019m doing especially during high volatility when I\u2019m able to pick up stocks at lower prices during or after selloffs. This concentrated buying has allowed me to see pretty big upside when the stock rebounds especially if it rises more than the index. The risks of this is that SPY/QQQ has been rising consistently. I have been really conservative about buying tech thinking the market will pull back and I have missed out big as a result.

I think this is a 5-10 year play. I buy on dips. I\u2019m too afraid to sell covered calls on this for fear of the price running without me.\n\n-Arm bought near 52 week low and sold around $80 thinking it was overvalued\u2026 I bought back with a small stake at $120 begrudgingly only to see it rise to $170.\n\n-hood. Bought at $8, sold for $9.50\u2026. Thought it would keep ping ponging. Bought back at $20 and will average down if need be but the company is not going out of business\n\n-rivn. Up 35% YTD, my biggest position. I bought slightly high but kept averaging down. I actually believe in the company. Cost basis $12.94.\n\n-aapl. Up 20% YTD. I have a small stake because I kept waiting for Apple to drop to $130 before rising to $200 which did not happen. Cost basis $195.\n\n-Bcrx. Up 58% YTD. I\u2019ve known this bio company for almost a decade now. They ping pong so it\u2019s mostly cyclical. $4.65 cost basis \n\n-cava. Up 26% YTD. Kicking myself for not buying more. \n\n-SG. Bought at like $9, sold at like $13. Kicking myself. I bought after reading about their subscription service and seeing how people are paying $20 for their orders\n\n-FBTC. Up 16.98%. Cost basis $47.14. Bitcoin is here to stay like it or not. Wish I didn\u2019t penny pinch when trying to buy 100 shares of MSTR 2 years ago for $500. \n\n-HUM. +19.52%, $323.75.

I think they are here to stay and will probably get to $60 in the next 5 years.\n\n-Meta. +19.29%, $420. I actually bought Meta at $115 during the crazy but got spooked when it dropped below $110, I sold for a profit but kicked myself for not holding. I believe in the company and they are just getting started revenue wise in my opinion. So many AI plays here. Regretting not having the cash to load up this time around. \n\n-NFTY. +15.23%. $53.77. India will probably keep growing. This stock also pays a good dividend. \n\n-RBRK. +13.75. $30.83. Cybersecurity is growing. I also have positive numbers in Palo Alto which I buy on earnings drops\n\n-snap. +42.52%. $11.33. Snap is not going out of business. The stock drops after earnings so I just buy then and wait for a rebound. It\u2019s one of my largest holdings. Wish I dumped more cash and wish it would drop when the market drops but it\u2019s held firm the last few months\n\n-Z. +23.83%. $40.83. Bought during the sell off when the courts ruled against the industry. Zillow will be fine. \n\n\nI actually don\u2019t have many losers. The stakes are small.\n\n-Aal. -14.41%. $12.54. I think it will bounce back in a year or two. \n\n-CGC. -15.33%. $7.52. I don\u2019t know much about weed but figured I\u2019d buy a small stake just in case.\n\n-MSOS. -14.19%. $8.70. Small stakes in weed, lottery ticket\n\n-WBD. -15.88%. $8.66. The worst buy I\u2019ve made. Figured might as well keep it.\n\n-Snow. -13.67%. $154.53. I knew I was buying high with snowflake but didn\u2019t expect the big drop. The stake is not big. I still do believe in the company.\n\n-Dis. -9.94%. $107.54. Knew I was buying high, my fault really. Thankfully not a big position and Disney will bounce back.\n\n-Hubs. -17.29%. $570.91. Tiny stake. I actually like the current price and will buy around $420.\n\n-CMG. -7.08%. $61.36. Knew I was buying high but long term hold.\n\n-PZZA. -7.84%. $45.74. One of my larger stakes. Papa John\u2019s is at a 4-5 year low which is crazy to me since their numbers are not bad. It\u2019s a cyclical play if you look at the chart. Plus the company is not going out of business. Worst case scenario is this drops to high $20s which do don\u2019t know how that can even happen. I\u2019ll keep buying weekly. ",

    "selftext": "- Meta Platforms Inc. (META) Formerly known as Facebook, Meta Platforms Inc. is at the forefront of the metaverse revolution. With its rebranding, Meta signaled a strategic pivot towards building the metaverse. The company is investing heavily in VR and AR through its Oculus division, aiming to create immersive social experiences. Meta's vast user base and financial resources position it well to capitalize on the metaverse's potential. The company has pulled back on its plans to invest $10 billion into the space as the cost of the AI race has increased, leading META to reinvest in other areas. Still, the company is a safe way to play the metaverse trend.\u2002 \n\n- Roblox Corporation (RBLX) Roblox is a platform that allows users to create, share, and experience games and virtual worlds. It has a massive and engaged user base, particularly among younger demographics. Roblox's user-generated content model is a microcosm of the broader metaverse vision, where users can build and monetize their virtual experiences. The company's innovative approach and strong community make it a compelling investment in the metaverse space. \n\n- Unity Software Inc. (U) Unity is a leading platform for creating and operating interactive, real-time 3D content. Its software is widely used in gaming, architecture, engineering, and construction. As the metaverse expands, the demand for tools to create 3D environments and experiences will grow. Unity's robust development ecosystem and cross-industry applications position it well to benefit from the metaverse's development. \n\n- Matterport (MTTR) Matterport is a compelling metaverse play due to its cutting-edge technology in 3D spatial data capture and digital twin creation. The company's platform enables users to create highly detailed and immersive digital replicas of physical spaces, which are essential for building and populating the metaverse with realistic environments. Matterport's technology is widely applicable across various industries, including real estate, architecture, construction, and retail, offering significant growth potential as these sectors increasingly adopt virtual and augmented reality solutions.\u2002 \n\nThe metaverse represents a new frontier with the potential to transform numerous aspects of our lives. Investing in companies at the forefront of this technological evolution offers opportunities for substantial returns. As the metaverse continues to develop, the companies highlighted above are well-positioned to lead and capitalize on this exciting digital revolution. Whether through VR/AR innovations, powerful computing platforms, or immersive virtual experiences, these top names are paving the way in the metaverse, making them compelling investment opportunities for those looking to tap into the future of digital interaction.",

    "title": "Fiverr - An unfairly beaten down 'pandemic stock'? An Investment Thesis for what currently looks like a contrarian bet. ",
    "selftext": "# Context\n\nA lot of pandemic era stocks lacked basic unit economics, and were found out when the funding stopped and subsequently collapsed.\n\nSome had network effects / unit economics, but needed to \u2018get fit\u2019 (think Uber and Meta), some have righted their mid-pandemic wrongs with clear turnaround / value creation plans and been rewarded (think Carvana), and some have righted the wrongs but not yet been rewarded. I think\u00a0**Fiverr ($FVRR)**\u00a0sits in this latter category.\n\nFiverr is a leading freelance marketplace which connects businesses with freelancers offering a wide range of services.\n\n# About the company\n\nFounded in 2010 by Micha Kaufman and Shai Winiger in Tel Aviv, Fiverr operates a two-sided marketplace matching small businesses with freelancers.\n\nWith approximately 700 employees, Fiverr is listed on the New York Stock Exchange ($FVRR) and had a market cap of just under $1 billion in June 2024, down from about $11 billion during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n**Problem statement Fiverr solves**\n\nFiverr transforms the opaque and inefficient process of hiring freelancers into a modern, user-friendly e-commerce experience.\n\n**Unique Selling Proposition (USP):**\n\nFiverr offers an easy-to-use platform where people can buy and sell small services for a flat starting fee. The platform boasts a comprehensive catalogue of services and well-vetted freelancers.\n\n**Potential sources of network effects:**\n\n* **Buyers**: Around 4 million buyers, with approximately 65% of core marketplace revenue from repeat buyers, indicating sustained user engagement.\n* **Service Categories**: Over 700 freelance service categories, including recent additions like AI content and development. Gigs range from $5 to $50,000.\n* **Freelancers**: Approximately 400,000 active freelance sellers.\n\n# Investment Thesis\n\n**Star Company**\n\nFiverr operates in a profitable and growing market niche (SMB freelance digital services) with growth exceeding 10% per year. It is a leader in its niche, matching freelancers to smaller SMEs effectively. This makes it a \u2018Star Company\u2019.\n\n# Reasons why I think the stock will rise:\n\n1. **Overly Beaten-Down Tech Stock**: Fiverr, has seen its share price decline by over 90% from its February 2021 peak. This significant drop \u2013 which has also recently been exacerbated by the geopolitical concerns in Israel and Palestine and the disruptive impact of AI on its business \u2013 is a common trend among tech stocks that were COVID-19 beneficiaries. What seems to have been overlooked is Fiverr retains a very viable and growing business post pandemic.\n2. **Shift to Profitability and Cash Generation**: Fiverr\u2019s growth has slowed to approximately 10% year-over-year as it has pivoted its focus towards profitability and cash generation, addressing investor demand for a focus on fundamentals. This strategic shift is reflected in improved bottom-line results, including free cash flow (FCF) and earnings per share (EPS), underpinned by key performance indicators like higher average ticket sizes and growing gross margins.\n3. **Attractive Valuation Metrics**: Following recent share price pressures, Fiverr currently trades at a 2024 forecast earnings/enterprise value multiple that is attractive (c. 8.6x) given its 10% growth rate and acceleration in key value creation metrics, including EPS, FCF per share, and return on invested capital (ROIC).\n4. **AI concerns appear overblown**: Investors are concerned AI will disrupt the services provided by freelancers on Fiverr\u2019s platform, but Fiverr\u2019s Q1 2024 results exceeded expectations, leading to raised guidance for the full year. Management has highlighted the net positive impact of AI on the business.\n5. **Stable Take Rate and Financial Resilience**: Fiverr\u2019s take rate remains stable at 30%, it has a $304m net cash position, and the company is free cash flow positive, providing significant financial resilience. I.e. it has gotten beyond \u2018default alive\u2019.\n6. **Dynamic Macro Environment**: While the macroeconomic environment remains challenging with constrained budgets in large enterprises and financial pressures on small businesses, Fiverr\u2019s high exposure to smaller businesses positions revenues to rebound quickly as conditions improve.\n7. **Share Buyback Program**: In May 2024, Fiverr initiated a $100 million share buyback program, reflecting management\u2019s belief that the stock is undervalued. They are confident in their cash position and free cash flow generation to support this initiative.\n8. **Large Short Float:**\u00a0The short float was around 10% as of June 2024, indicating the possibility of large upwards price moves if sentiment on the stock changes, as I think it should.\n\nOverall, Fiverr\u2019s strategic focus on profitability, robust financial health, and proactive management of market challenges make it a compelling investment opportunity.\n\n# Things I Don\u2019t Like About the Stock\n\n1. **Share-Based Compensation (SBC):**\u00a0The level of share-based compensation appears excessive and results in significant dilution. Deducting SBC from free cash flow results in a near zero number, meaning free cash flow per share is not trending up as quickly as desired.\n2. **AI Cannibalization threat**: AI has the potential to cannibalize certain services offered on Fiverr, such as logo design and article writing, which could impact revenue.\n3. **Buyer Trends**: While the number of buyers has been declining, this has been offset by an increase in the average purchase price. This trend is concerning and needs to be monitored.\n\nOverall - looks like a decent buy at current prices. It currently trades at $24.5. Analyst expectations are $26 on the low end and $45 at the high. My target is late $30s\n\nI placed a limit buy order at $24.5, which filled last night. At the same time I also took a position in Upwork, which has the same business model but is focussed on larger customers and is perhaps better equipped for AI implementation type services.",

    "selftext": "For context, I planned on holding the original stocks for a few years, but ended up parlaying into AI when I developed strong conviction.\n\nIn previous posts, I shared more about the \u2018why\u2019 behind the investment decisions and reallocation.

Insight\u00a0\n2. Conviction\u00a0\n3. Patience\n\n**Insight**\n\nI\u2019ve learned to largely ignore headlines and talking heads, which seem more reactionary than insightful and optimizing for entertainment (clicks/views).\u00a0\n\nBen Graham\u2019s quote rings true:\u00a0\n\n>\u201cIn the short run, the market is a voting machine but in the long run, it is a weighing machine.\u201d\n\nPerhaps counterintuitively, I\u2019ve found it more useful to read/listen to tech/business analysts who focus on strategy and how that interacts with macro trends (along with financials) than solely financial analysts and stock pickers.\u00a0\n\nFinancials are a good indicator of fundamentals, but are backward-looking. However, valuation is forward-looking, thus driven by strategy x trends x structural advantages, so we must consider both.\u00a0\n\n# Math\n\nIn 2023 I also started\u00a0practicing math daily\u00a0(243 days straight\u00a0as of this morning) in order to better understand the mathematics behind AI. As part of that, I had to take remedial coursework to build my foundations since it had been so long since I\u2019d done any meaningful math.\u00a0\n\nI\u2019m not sure how much, but it\u00a0*feels*\u00a0like it helped with the reallocation decisions I made in late 2023 and early 2024. I felt more confident and deliberate in making trades. The math journey has been quite challenging, but personally rewarding, whether it has helped or not.\u00a0\n\n**Conviction**\n\nA big part of this is just a better understanding of myself and what kind of investor I am. I invest in what I believe in long-term.\u00a0\n\nHowever, someone trading on volatility with a much shorter timeline may not care about conviction. You must understand what investment philosophy aligns with your psychology and your strengths.\u00a0\n\nConviction investing works for me because, even when building products (my day job), I\u2019ve always been strong with product vision/strategy and always building for the future, so it makes sense that I invest the same way. I\u2019m not sure why it took me so long to connect those dots, but I\u2019m happy I did.\u00a0\n\nA big part of this is also timing. AI seems to be a once-in-a-generation opportunity. Whereas 5 years ago I might have tried to force myself to believe crypto was the next big thing in the absence of anything substantial.\u00a0\n\nThis is another reminder that success (in investing or otherwise) is all about timing and opportunity. When opportunities arise,\u00a0you must seize them.\n\n**Patience**\n\nAs a result of my convictions, I\u2019m much more patient in my investing these days and don\u2019t react to the day-to-day.\u00a0\n\nI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if I don\u2019t make another trade for the rest of 2024.\n\n**UPDATE:**\n\nA commenter asked about benchmarks, which I failed to include since I don't pay attention to them, so I had to look it up:\n\nI opened my portfolio in June 2022. Since then the cumulative S&P return is \\~28% (\\~39% for Nasdaq). My cumulative return for that same period is around \\~215%. The annual rate of return (per my Vanguard dashboard) is 77.9% as mentioned in the original post. I would expect my returns to revert to the mean over time.",

However, their decision to add large language models (LLMs) to apps like Instagram, Threads, Facebook, and WhatsApp has me scratching my head a bit.\n\nGenerally, people hop onto these platforms to chat and get entertained (Watch people get hit by cars on Instagram Reels), not for heavy-duty tasks like studying or research, which are typical uses for LLMs. Trying to do homework or deep dives into topics on a buzzing social media site? That sounds pretty distracting.\n\nI think Meta could really hit it out of the park if they used LLMs to boost their advertising game instead. Imagine an LLM that helps advertisers craft killer campaigns or dig deeper into understanding their audiences. Sort of like Palantir\u2019s software of gathering data and using an LLM to sort it and understand it better; but with consumers and their buying habits. That could really amp up what Meta offers to businesses and drive their growth much more effectively.\n\nI still think META is a big buy since their forward PE is in the 20\u2019s and Mark Zuckerberg has a great vision for the company, besides this move; Solid buy.\n\nIf anyone disagrees with me please let me know!",

There might have been a year that I nominally missed but if you add up all my investments and look at the gains, it\u2019s significantly higher than if I just invested in a boring S&P ETF.  My Fidelity account does this for me automatically and I\u2019ve always been higher\u2026for over a decade now. \n\nSo hear me out, I\u2019ve made some dumb mistakes and lost $$$ along the way but my winners have always offset that. My game plan is pretty simple: always invest in large cap stocks.  \n\nWith a diverse portfolio made up of Microsoft, Nvidia, Facebook (now meta), Amazon, Tesla, Apple, Nvidia, Amd, and a few others, I\u2019ve found this sector completely destroys the overall \u201cmarket.\u201d Sure I have a few outliers like Home Depot and OLIN but when I look at my pie chart, it\u2019s very aggressive and very heavily in tech.  \n\nThe difference in the S&P vs the NASDAQ confirms this over the last 20 years or more and you could argue I\u2019ve built my own sort of NASDAQ mutual fund in a ways, but I\u2019m still beating the NASDAQ too.  \n\nThe contrarian\u2019s argument is that given enough time, my large cap tech picks will eventually falter and I will begin losing but at the amount I\u2019m up right now, for over a decade, that correction would have to be astronomical and I don\u2019t see how the whole world economy wouldn\u2019t fall if these tech picks crash down 50% at once.  \n\nI\u2019m not trying to brag or troll this group or anything like that.  I\u2019m just genuinely interested to know if tech has made it relatively easy to now beat the overall market, and if so, what consequences does that have on the stability of the whole market if more investors start doing what I\u2019m doing?  \n\nIs there a point where the \u201cmarket\u201d is all tech now?  It sure feels like the S&P is so heavily weighted by tech now that maybe that\u2019s the real underlying answer to my question.  ",

    "title": "Once a Hot Stock-Market Trend Has a Name, Its Best Days Are Likely too late",
    "selftext": "Once a Hot Stock-Market Trend Has a Name, Its Best Days Are Likely Past -- Journal Report  \nMarch 1, 2024 (Dow Jones)  \nBy Derek Horstmeyer  \nOnce a stock-market trend has been identified and named -- think FAANG or the Magnificent Seven -- the headiest gains are typically past. But riding a trend after it has been named can deliver market-beating returns for another year or so before the trade loses momentum and gives back some of the gains.  \nTo study the performance of named stock-market trends, my research assistants (Matthew Rickard and Camila Mar\u00edn Builes) and I did a deep-dive on eight named trends over the past 10 years that were popularized by the mainstream media and covered by more than three such organizations.  \nThe final list of named trends we researched was:  \n\\-- Watch -- for retailers Walmart, Amazon.com, Target, Costco Wholesale and Home Depot.  \n\\-- FANG -- for tech titans Facebook parent Meta Platforms, Amazon, Netflix and Google parent Alphabet.  \n\\-- FAANG -- for Facebook, Amazon, Apple (the second A after 2017), Netflix and Google.  \n\\-- Granola -- for big European companies GSK, Roche, Nestl\u00e9, L'Or\u00e9al, LVMH Mo\u00ebt Hennessy Louis Vuitton, Novartis, Novo Nordisk, ASML Holding, AstraZeneca, SAP and Sanofi.  \n\\-- The Magnificent Seven -- for tech giants Nvidia, Tesla, Meta, Apple, Alphabet, Amazon and Microsoft.  \n\\-- MT SAAS -- for cloud-computing players Microsoft, Twilio, Salesforce, Adobe, Amazon and Shopify.  \n\\-- BAT -- for Chinese tech firms Baidu, Alibaba Group and Tencent.  \n\\-- Cloud -- for emerging cloud-computing stocks, notably PayPal, Zoom Video Communications, Vimeo, Dropbox, Alphabet, Adobe and Salesforce  \nSmaller named trends like Mamaa (Meta, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon and Alphabet) and Emcloud were omitted because of overlap with other named trends, and their inclusion wouldn't have changed results.  \nFrom first mention  \nNext, we identified the first date each trend was mentioned in the popular press. Then, for each named trend we looked at the stock returns around this date going back 24 months before the zero-date (date of first mention) and 24 months after the zero-date.  \nFor each named trend, we use an equal weighting to calculate the return of the trade. So, for instance for FAANG, we applied a 20% weight to Meta's return, a 20% weight to Apple's, a 20% weight to Amazon's, 20% to Netflix and 20% to Alphabet. Finally, we calculated the cumulative excess returns over time for each named trend, where the excess return is the return for the trade minus the return on the S&P 500.  \nThe first interesting finding: When we look at the average of all these eight named trends, we see considerable price run-up before the trade being named. For the 24 months before the zero-date, we see the average named trend deliver 36% in excess returns. This means that if you magically knew about a new named trend before it happened, you could earn 36 percentage points above the S&P 500 for the two years before it was named.  \nWorth the ride, until...  \nBut even if you don't have this magical foresight, it still doesn't hurt to ride a trend once it has been coined. On average, once the trend has been named and looking ahead 12 months, an investor can still earn about 13 percentage points in excess returns.  \nYet 12 months following the naming is about the best you can do as returns peak at this point on average and decrease a bit subsequently. From the 12-month mark to the 24-month mark after a trend has been named, the average named trend lags behind the S&P 500 by about 2 percentage points.  \nWhen we look at the individual named trends, it might surprise people that the two best trades from the zero-date to the 24-month mark in our sample were the BAT and Cloud trends -- both earning more than 60% in excess return over the two-year period once they were coined by the press.  \nOn the other end, the MT SAAS trade did the worst, dropping more than 95% in excess returns over the two-year period after being named.  \nAll in all, this means your best option is to jump on a named trend as soon as you first hear about it -- provided you haven't been too late to the party -- and ride the initial momentum, if it happens. But if you get in past the 12-month mark, the returns might not be so magnificent.  \nDerek Horstmeyer is a professor of finance at Costello College of Business, George Mason University, in Fairfax, Va.",

This early lead has given the company unbounded pricing power, driving its margins in the most recent quarter to over 76%.\n\n> over the past few months we have seen signs of competition entering the market. This will affect Nvidia\u2019s margins and the company\u2019s ability to continue to grow at such a staggering rate. \n\n> the competition is coming from an array of places [in addition to AMD who is predicting $4B for their new GPU] that include a number of Nvidia\u2019s largest and most important customers. For example, Amazon.com Inc.\u2019s AWS cloud has its AI chips for training and inference, Microsoft recently announced its Maia AI chip, and Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google continues to innovate on its Tensor Processing Units (TPUs).

    "selftext": "Looking at historical data, does it show that this is the worst time to ever invest in the stock market? I say that by looking at the data. For example. Amazon trades at 100x earnings and grows 15 percent a year. That is a terrible stock for anyone trying to actually get a return from the asset itself, but trading it is potentially profitable like it is for every single stock. Also I have another example. Nvidia trades at like 35 x sales. The margins are high but obviously companies like Meta will inevitably have to roll out their own independent GPU solutions to control costs, and therefore the stock itself looks ungodly expensive. The same is looking at arm. Arm which trades at like 150 x earnings, or something crazy, literally grows at like 28 percent. That means it will takes like 26 years to even get a 10 percent return for the equity.\n\nThen, if you look at what stocks were trading at in like 2004, Apple, it was like 33 x earnings with higher revenue growth, a tiny market cap, better leadership. This compared to the 2000's investing environment or earlier is terrible, yet it seems people think that they can make investments whenever they want.  \n\n\nIt goes on and on. Looking at Palantir which trades at a crazy multiple, or basically any software company, yes it's possible to buy Palantir or any stock and it triple, but trying to get earnings at a good multiple in other words, Real INVESTING seems to be literally impossible right now.  \n\n\nEven the chinese stock market has collapsed mainly due to companies like Alibaba growing at only 5 percent their topline.   \n\n\nAnd there are questions like how is this possible and is this partly due to extremely irresponsible Fed reserve activity mainly due to QE pushing valuations to their highest levels ever. Also do the people here think that this is the worst investing environment ever when compared to historical pe ratios?",

    "title": "Booking Holdings stock analysis (Burry's 4th Largest Holding)",
    "selftext": "Hi everyone, I hope you are all well. I want to share my thoughts on Booking as a company since I think Booking is interesting. If you're looking for a superficial analysis and don't like reading, look elsewhere. This isn't a superficial analysis, which is what is typically shared. I'll share why I think Booking might be differentiated from major competitors like Expedia and AirBnb. I'll also do an overview of the economics of the business, then write about the industry and competitors and estimate the intrinsic value. As I am sure all of you know, this is just my thoughts so please do your own research. I hope I provide some insights and I welcome an exchange of ideas.\n\n# Company Overview:\n\nBooking is an online travel agency (OTA). It is a parent company that holds a number of brands such as Booking, KAYAK, RentalCars, Priceline, Agoda and Opentable. As a whole, Booking provides reservation services for customers looking for accommodations, flights, rental cars, taxis, and restaurants. There is a lot interplay between these brands.\n\nBooking categories their revenue as Agency, Merchant & Advertising & Other:\n\nRevenue *(In millions)*\n\n||**2022**|**2021**|**2020**|**2019**|**2018**|**2017**|**2016**|**2015**|2014|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Agency|$9,003|$6,663|$4,314|$10,117|$10,480|$9,714|$7,982|$6,527|$5,845|\n|Merchant|$7,193|$3,696|$2,117|$3,830|$2,987|$1,891|$1,620|$1,450|$1,329|\n|Advertising & Other|$894|$599|$365|$1,119|$1,060|$834|$713|$613|$410|\n|**Total**|**$17,090**|**$10,958**|**$6,796**|**$15,066**|**$14,527**|**$12,439**|**$10,314**|**$8,591**|**$7,584**|\n\nBooking mainly generates revenue on commissions. Agency revenue is when Booking makes a reservation for a customer but does not facilitate payment; the supplier (hotels, airlines, etc) will follow up with the customer for payment. Merchant revenue is when Booking acts as a merchant; i.e. collect payment and remits payment to supplier. Bookings earns commission on both of these categories.\n\nMerchant revenue is catching up and increasing its percentage as a proportion of total revenue and although this doesn't negatively impact Booking in regards to its position in the industry, it does negatively impact their margins.\n\nOperating Margins: \n\n|**2014**|**2015**|**2016**|**2017**|**2018**|**2019**|**2020**|**2021**|**2022**|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|42.2%|40.5%|37.92%|28.18%|36.48%|36.7%|35.48%|\\-9.28%|22.78%|\n\n\\*We can see that as the merchant category increases as a proportion of sales, operating margins are decreasing. Merchant revenue incurs additional expenses.\n\n***Advertising & Other*** is revenue mainly earned by KAYAK for its meta-search platform: This platform lists hotel chains, flights, etc on its website. ***I am going to disregard this segment because Google Flights does the same thing, so I am estimating no growth here. Some people view Google as a competitor to Booking, and they do compete against KAYAK. However, Google benefits Booking's Agency and Merchant business since Google refers a lot of people to Bookings platforms. Google is ultimately an advertising business, they don't make reservations or facilitate payments.***\n\nMarketing Expense as a % of Total Revenue: \n\n|**2022**|**2021**|**2020**|**2019**|**2018**|**2017**|**2016**|**2015**|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|35%|34.6%|32%|32.9%|34.1%|36.2%|35.4%|35%|\n\n\\* Booking spends a lot on marketing and a lot of this spend is performance marketing on Google.\n\nRoom nights booked *(in mill):*\n\n|**2022**|**2021**|**2020**|**2019**|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|896|591|355|845|\n\n\\*What I like about this data is that room nights booked (one night booked = one room night) in 2022 is higher than 2019, which was the record prior to COVID. Room nights have been increasing significantly in geographical areas (like Asia-Pacific) which has lower average daily rates compared to areas like Europe and the U.S. This also impacts their margins.\n\n# Competitors:\n\nBookings Mix of Room nights for hotels and alternative accommodation:\n\n||||||\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n||**2022**|**2021**|**2020**|**2019**|\n|Hotels, Motels, Resorts|70%|71%|\\--|71%|\n|Alternative|30%|29%|\\--|29%|\n\n**AirBnb:**\n\nThe way I am thinking about this is 70% of Bookings accommodations are in hotels and motels and AirBnb mainly generate revenue from homes, holiday houses etc. This is only 30% of Bookings business, which they list as alternative. Although these two companies compete, I don't think it will affect Booking if Airbnb continues to grow since they don't specialise in hotel accommodations. I am curious to know your thoughts about this.\n\n**Website Traffic:**\n\nExpedia: 88.68% website traffic in the U.S.\n\nAirbnb: 71.54% website traffic in the U.S\n\n***Booking: 10.86% website traffic in the U.S***\n\nMost of Bookings website traffic is concentrated in Europe whereas Expedia and Airbnb is concentrated in the U.S. I believe this has other implications, especially when I compare Booking with Expedia that has a business model that is almost identical. Most of the hotel chains in the U.S are very popular: Marriott, Holiday Inn, Hilton, Hampton Inn and Hyatt to name a few. They have their own loyalty programs and big marketing and merchandising (cheap deals) campaigns and customers often seek these hotels out directly, although they are listed on Expedia as well. Since they are popular, they have bargaining power and can request lower commissions to be listed on an OTA. Since Expedia is heavily concentrated in the United States, this has an impact on their margins. Most of Bookings hotel suppliers are outside of the U.S. and these are often smaller, independent chains that rely more heavily on an OTA.\n\nExpedia operating margins:\n\n|**2022**|**2021**|**2020**|**2019**|**2018**|**2017**|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|10.2%|3%|\\-29.4%|8%|7%|6.6%|\n\n\\*I think this explains why Expedia's margins are a lot lower than Booking despite similar business models.\n\n# Industry:\n\nOTA industry estimates suggest it will grow to over $1 trillion at the end of 2030. It is currently at $521 billion. Estimated growth is just over 10%.\n\n# Intrinsic Value Estimate:\n\nHistorical data *(in mill)*:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n||**2023 (estimate)**|**2022**|**2021**|**2020**|**2019**|**2018**|**2017**|**2016**|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|**FCF**|$7,054|$5,913|$2,243|\\-$456|$4,318|$4,882|$4,398|$3,694|\n|**Percentage Change**|19.3%|163.6%|591%|\\-110%|\\-11.5%|11%|19%|33.45%|\n|**ROIC**|53.47%|43%|12.3%|\\-3.37%|29.61%|26.67%|23.9%|23.1%|\n\nGrowth rates:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|**Growth Rates**|**1-yr**|**3-yr**|**5-yr**|**7-yr**|**9-yr**|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Revenue|25%|47%|8%|11%|12%|\n|FCF|19%|N/A (COVID)|8%|10%|11%|\n\nI have taken the current year FCF estimate (2023 FY results isn't out yet), and have estimated a growth rate of 8% in yrs 1-5 and 6% in yrs 6-10, discount rate of 10% and terminal value of 20. The growth rates are estimated because of the industry growth projections and Bookings position in the market. Also the 5-year previous growth rates for Booking was 8%, which was the lowest compared to my 1-3-7 and 9 years growth rates so I went with that. 8% is a lower growth rate than the industry growth projections and I wanted to be conservative, especially since the FCF in the current year is at record highs. I always like putting a lower growth rate in the latter half (6%) because it is a lot harder to estimate. The discount rate is high, however, my style has always been to make fewer bets for higher returns and I am happy being patient until those opportunities arrive. This gave me an intrinsic value of $4,296. I try and go a bit further to see if I can get a discount to intrinsic value.\n\nMargin of Safety Price ranges *(Discount to Intrinsic Value):*\n\n|10%|$3,867|\n|:-|:-|\n|20%|$3,437|\n|30%|$3,007|\n|40%|$2,578|\n|50%|$2,148|\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Risk:\n\n* Interest debt has been increasing over the past 10 years.\n* COVID really impacted the OTA industry and who knows if another similar crises will occur\n\n\\*\\*\\* I did not invest in this company, I just wanted to share my thoughts.\n\n&#x200B;",

    "selftext": "Let's imagine the mindset of beginners. Beginners want to earn quickly, a lot and with minimal effort. And most likely, we know from our experience, they will be quite fearful. So they will choose those instruments that are well-known and have a good reputation. These will probably be stocks of companies such as Google, Meta, Amazon, Apple.\n\n**How will beginners add companies to their portfolio?**  \nLet's specify that the stocks of these companies are not cheap and cost 100-300 dollars. Of course beginners want to fill their portfolio on enthusiasm right now. This means our trader will go to the stock exchange and simply buy them.  \n**What is wrong with that?**  \nThe point is that you should buy shares of even the seemingly coolest and most famous companies not at any moment of time when you want to, but look at whether it is a good time to enter a position.  \n**What does good or bad timing mean?**  \nIn investing for 10-15 years the concepts of good and bad time lose their relevance. Because for such a long period of time stocks can fall and rise 100 times.  But if we speak about from 1 to 6 months trading, it is very important to choose the right moment. Because you need to earn money rather quickly and you want to earn more, of course.  \nFor the sake of simplicity let's consider 2 companies: META and AAPL.   \nBoth of them have a beautiful growing chart for the last year of trading, but you should not buy both companies now, if you take them for a short term.  \nThe fact is that META and AAPL stocks are at their all-time highs right now. They have rallied strongly over the past couple months and there will soon be a period when the price will be corrected. Since there is no one chart in the market that is a forever rising straight line. There will always come moments of correction. And if you buy their stocks now, you are very likely to buy at the most expensive price in recent times.  \nThat's why it's important to learn how to analyze charts and choose the moments to buy or sell smartly.",

A moderate probability that they will be below 15 billion. A low probability of exceeding 20 billion.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***Let's sidestep to AI marker TAM topic,***   \n   \n[*Meanwhile, looking forward to 2027, the server market's value is estimated at a staggering $195.6 billion.*](https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/nvidia-ai-and-hpc-gpu-sales-reportedly-approached-half-a-million-units-in-q3-thanks-to-meta-facebook)  \nHowever, this estimated revenue will be brought by those who rent AI processing capacities like AWS, GCP, and Azure cloud providers. And not ChatGPT clones. The market has not figured yet the TAM (total addressable market) of services like ChatGPT.    \n\n\nHowever, I try to speculate on [open numbers](https://explodingtopics.com/blog/chatgpt-users), which have stagnated for the last 6 months.   \n\n\n100 million monthly active users \\* 10$ per subscription produces 1 billion in revenue.   \n[The average cost of 1 query from a used is 4 cents](https://www.reuters.com/technology/chatgpt-owner-openai-is-exploring-making-its-own-ai-chips-sources-2023-10-06/).    \nA single user runs 2,000 queries per month on average. The query is a single text message you send to the chatbot.     \n2000 \\* 0.04 = 80 $ to service 1 user per month.   \nUntil the OpenAI level of efficiency improves they will be losing 70$ to service 1 user per month.   \nNo wonder OpenAI has closed its ChatGPT Plus subscription.  It doesn't seem sustainable.\n\n  \nLast note,\n\nthe majority of data centers upgrade their equipment every 4-5 years. So, if AI expectations won't burst, and chip efficiency improves 10-fold, and other chip makers won't catch up, don't expect big tech to re-stock their chips earlier than the end of 2027.   \n\n\n&#x200B;",

    "selftext": "I'll just say first off, I don't think AR is the big investment right now. AI is clearly here now, and AR is maybe 5 years out before some VERY heavy investment. Right now the leaders are Meta and Apple. \n\nOpinions: \n\nMeta Case: Meta's headset makes you look like a cyborg, its very goofy looking compared to the Apple Vision Pro. It's also angled at gaming, which is problematic because none of the major gaming companies have committed to it, meaning until that occurs there is no guarantee that the gaming angle plays out. I imagine programming a VR game is SIGNIFICANTLY more intensive of an investment than required for an xbox game. That said META is not cannibalizing its own sales nearly as much as Apple...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nApple Case: The vision pro looks much cleaner, as do almost all Apple products. Apple has the wearable tech that will help them make the headset much smaller over time. They are also angled towards business. I just watched the Vision Pro video and frankly it looks like a great product for three reasons: The clean look, the dimming of a room when watching TV/movies which enhances the experience and makes it more convenient. Finally, I think the environment one is very good. I can be doing my work on the vision pro \"literally\" surrounded by Mount Doom's lava and Frodo bringing the ring up to the mountain. The massive con is that the vision pro cannibalizes the iphone and the mac book. As the vision pro gains traction there is immediately less of an incentive for using the iphone and the mac book which make up a big piece of apple's sales.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat are your thoughts? Right now, my money is in Meta, but after seeing Apple's product I think apple has gone the right direction. Meta is too reliant on the gaming industry and they haven't made it nearly as suitable for wearing it in social situations. No way you're wearing that headset around other people at a party.",

    "title": "Just how big are the Magnificent Seven?",
    "selftext": "This is a big quote from MarketWatch. I\u2019ve seen the numbers before, but this really gave me pause. \n\n> These captains of the SS S&P 500 are Google parent Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Facebook parent Meta Platforms, Microsoft, NVIDIA, and Tesla. They've been described as the magnificent seven by many news organizations. Fortunately for me, there's a common thread among this group. They are the only U.S. companies that have ever been valued at a trillion dollars by the public markets. To say these companies are dominating the S&P 500 is a giant understatement. Last year, their collective valuation gained more than $5 trillion. Compare that to the S&P 500's valuation gain of less than $8 trillion. That means the trillionaires were responsible for roughly 65% of the Index's market cap gain last year, despite comprising just 1.4% of its components. But doesn't this go against the main reason behind investing in S&P 500 index funds? Wouldn't the entire index be susceptible to a massive drop if just one of these seven companies failed?\n\n> Phil Van Dorn: Well, I like index funds because they spread out your risk over many stocks and because the expenses are so low. In the mutual fund industry, traditionally, you might be looking at expenses of 1% of assets under management per year, and that can really pile up over time. But with an S&P 500 Index Fund, your expenses get close to zero. But as you have mentioned when you called the group of expensive stocks the Trillionaires' Club, a small group of companies now make up between 27 and 30% of the S&P 500 depending on which day you look at it.\n\n> Jeremy Owens: Right, so that's seven out of 500 companies accounting for more than a quarter or less than a third of the entire market cap of the S&P 500 and really swaying the underlying metrics. What should an investor kind of take from this and how should we look at the S&P 500 moving forward, knowing how much these companies matter?\n\n> Phil Van Dorn: One can say that there's a heck of a lot of risk in the seven companies that make up only 1% of the S&P 500, but make up close to a third of its value. However, the S&P 500 is self-correcting. It rewards success.",

    "selftext": "I joined eTrade in 2013 a few years after graduating college. I had set up automatic monthly contributions to my accounts, which I slowly raised over time and mostly invested in blue chip stocks. \n\nOn December 1, 2020, the combined value of my Roth and Traditional Brokerage account was just over $100k. It took me over seven years to get there and was a major milestone.  In the past three years, I have raised my monthly contributions, continued to invest, and am now just shy of $200k at the age of 35. You read about the power of compound gains all the time, but to go from $100k to $200k in three years when the first $100k took seven years is a testiment to that fact.  My goal is $1 mil by 47 and eventually to hit $2.5 mil before I retire. \n\nFor all you youngins out there, stick with it! But also, don't rush the process and try to hit home runs every day. For the most part, I am a buy and hold investor after a year or two of trying my hand at day trading with options and futures. When you chase the money, you won't make it. But if you\u2019re patient with a decent risk tolerance, anything is possible. \n\n\n\nEdit: Wow, thanks for the up votes everyone. It\u2019s been fun reading the comments. Adding some context here based on some of the questions that have come in. Monthly contributions are at $1,000 a month now, but in the early years they were less. When I first started, it was $100 a month and I worked my way up from there. There was a good chunk of time where they were between $200-$500 a month. These accounts were set up on my own, no employer match. I\u2019m not sure what my lifetime performance is, but the last three years I\u2019m up 30% overall. All that in mind, I can confidently say that well over half of my account is due to investment gains. \n\nInvestments have been all individual stocks that I typically hold for a year or longer. I pick them based on both technical and fundamental factors. This is more risky than ETFs and index funds but it suits my investing style and risk tolerance. I try to stick to profitable companies with a stock price that has a history of moving in the right direction, however I also like to buy at a discount price. I keep my eyes on charts and when there\u2019s opportunities to buy at historically undervalued prices I jump on it. There\u2019s really nothing super special to it. Not going to share my current exact portfolio, but stocks I have owned in the past or currently include AAPL, GOOGL, META, COST, HD, MCD, DKNG, AMD, DIS, and BAC to name a few. There are many others I\u2019m interested in buying that are on my watchlist.\n\nI will also add that I\u2019ve made a ton of mistakes along the way. Bad investments, selling too soon when I should of just held, taking risky, over leveraged day trades that resulted in nasty losses and wash sales. However, I\u2019ve learned from them and never done anything bad enough that blew an account or resulted in a draw down that couldn\u2019t be recovered. You can read all the books you want but I\u2019ve always found that the best way is to learn by doing and over time you develop your own skills and are able to trust your own analysis and decisions.",

    "selftext": "What I take from the article below is not to rely too much on a macro-driven asset allocation strategy.  But what asset allocation strategy makes sense in this environment then?  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n www.ft.com /content/c5d7ee71-92a2-4840-9344-2f62e9642e61\n\n# Narrow markets should humble macro forecasters\n\n5-6 minutes  \n2023-08-08  \nToby Nangle   \nThe writer is a former global head of asset allocation at a fund manager  \nThis year has been marked by strong equity markets, and what looks to be an astonishingly narrow rally. Of the 16.9 per cent returned by the S&P 500 index in the first half of this year, 12.9 per cent derived from the performance of only 10 companies.  \nWith such a high proportion of a market\u2019s value created by so few groups, it feels fair to question the tool kits of asset allocators and, more broadly, the product line-up of fund management firms.  \nNarrow stock market returns are, after all, the norm. Research by Arizona State University professor Hendrik Bessembinder shows that more than half of the $55.1tn in net wealth generated by the US equity market between 1926 and 2022 came from the performance of fewer than 0.3 per cent of the market\u2019s stocks, with the other half of this net wealth coming from the next best 3.1 per cent of stocks.  \nMoreover, almost three-fifths of stocks actually destroyed wealth over the period. In quant-speak, the distribution of compound stock returns has been very positively skewed.  \nIn addition, the skewness of equity returns turns out not to be a particularly North American phenomenon. Indeed, in the three decades ending in December 2020 the proportion of net wealth contributed by the best 1 per cent of emerging market stocks was more than 80 per cent.  \nLooking at the entire global stock universe outside the US, the proportion rises still further to more than 90 per cent. Winners have won big. Most individual stocks over the past 30 years have failed to outperform dollars stored under the mattress, let alone a local currency interest-bearing cash deposits \u2014 even after taking into account dividends.  \nBessembinder\u2019s work has typically been surveyed in terms of what it means for active stockpickers \u2014 with some seeing it as a rationalisation for chasing moonshots and others for pursuing passive index-investing. Less examined has been what it means for asset allocators.  \nDeveloped market stock index returns have been dominated by global companies \u2014 even if they each carry a domestic tilt. As such, connecting local macroeconomic developments to the performance of a region\u2019s equity index can be something of a dark art.  \nSingle large stocks with an economic fate that has little to do with their listing jurisdiction have dominated national index returns. For example, the photolithography machine-maker ASML accounts for more than a fifth of the total net wealth created by Dutch stocks in the 30 years up to 2020. Global fast-fashion retailer Inditex accounts for more than a sixth of Spanish stock returns. Global luxury brands LVMH and L\u2019Or\u00e9al collectively account for almost a quarter of the returns from French stocks. These are not outliers. One cannot explain long-term returns without reference to such companies in pretty much any region.  \nIf it becomes hard to explain equity index returns without reference to specific superstar groups, it stands to reason that it must be even harder to forecast equity index returns without taking a view on some individual companies. It\u2019s easy today to focus on whether the Magnificent Seven that have powered the S&P 500 rally \u2014 Apple, Microsoft, Google owner Alphabet, Amazon, Nvidia, Tesla and Meta \u2014 might stumble. With more than a quarter of the US market\u2019s valuation riding on them, the question is not at all trivial. But 30 years ago, five of these seven had not even listed. It\u2019s hard to take a view on companies that don\u2019t yet exist.  \nI\u2019ve been as guilty as the next asset allocator in explaining my preference for US over European stocks or vice versa with reference to some domestic macroeconomic outlook. Given that financials, utilities and property groups will carry a strong domestic flavour, this is still forgivable.  \nBut when constructing a long-term strategic asset allocation, it is becoming increasingly untenable to justify regional preferences with reference to local macroeconomic forecasts. This may explain why long-term return forecasts for equity markets \u2014 or Capital Market Assumptions, as they are known \u2014 have such a lousy record.  \nThe biggest single investment decision any institutional or individual investor is likely to make in their portfolio is their choice of strategic asset allocation. To create a strategic asset allocation one must make reasonable guesses about future market returns. Bessembinder\u2019s research shows quite how invariably such reasonable guesses will be blindsided by the fate of single stocks.",

    "selftext": "To start with, I'm 41 years old, and have been investing since I was 22. Right now, my portfolio is just around a million dollars - still waiting to get a $87k tax refund from the government. Here's a screenshot of my portfolio:\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/c1c6c8X.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/c1c6c8X.jpg)\n\nEdit: The portfolio total is in Canadian dollars. So convert US holdings like SCHD, VOO, IBTG etc from USD to CAD, and the total should add up.\n\nEdit 2: You'll see that I'm not exclusively chasing dividends either. I have VOO, AVUV etc that have pretty poor dividends.\n\nAs you can see, I have a strong dividend tilt. I'm not trying to squeeze 7% or 8% from my portfolio. I think 3-4% is a good balance between growth and dividends.\n\nYesterday, I saw a long polemic about \"young\" investors chasing dividends: [https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/15d7p3e/why\\_are\\_many\\_especially\\_young\\_people\\_investing\\_in/](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/15d7p3e/why_are_many_especially_young_people_investing_in/)\n\nWhile I'm not exactly old, I'm not exactly young either. And here's why I think the poster is wrong about dividends.\n\n**The Arguments for Dividends**\n\n*1. We all Know that Dividends are not free money*\n\nNo investor thinks that dividends are \"free money\". Obviously money doesn't grow on trees, and we all know it has to come from somewhere. People often use this as a \"gotcha\", but it's a straw man. Is there any reasonable investor who thinks dividends spring from the earth?\n\nNo. Everyone knows that dividends come from a company's assets. So let's get that out of the way.\n\n*2. Wealth is an Income Stream, Not Capital*\n\nAt a fundamental level, I don't care about stock prices. I care about only two things:\n\na) What is my income stream?\n\nb) How fast is that income stream growing?\n\nAnyone reading an old Charles Dickens book knows that the English used to measure a person's wealth, not by how much they have, but by how much income was coming in. For example, here's a quote from Great Expectations:\n\n**\"His rise in the world was not much appreciated by Mrs. Pocket, who had a decided inaptitude for doing anything to an amount. But, Biddy, he was five hundred a year\"**\n\nIn his book \"The Four Pillars of Investing\", Bernstein makes the same point. He says that at some time, Americans became enamored with the number in their brokerage account and started talking about wealth as if it were a static number.\n\nFor me, I don't care about the value of my brokerage account. I care about its income stream. No income stream? Then you're poor. At least for me. Doesn't matter if I have a million dollars in my brokerage.\n\n*3. Dividends ARE From a Company's Earnings*\n\nFor some reason, the poster bring up bad companies who sell assets to pay dividends. There are bad companies everywhere. We don't use them as examples to make a point. Good companies earn money, and pay dividends from those earnings. This isn't hard to understand.\n\n*4. Companies Overestimate their Ability to Re-invest their Earnings into Growth*\n\nHere's the big one. The theory goes that companies that don't pay dividends will re-invest that money into even more growth. Tax efficient growth! Who doesn't want that?\n\nAnyone reading this, who works for a public company, will know exactly how much money is wasted on bureaucracy, corporate management, bonuses, and all kinds of junk. Just last year, we were treated to the news that tech companies wasted billions of dollars hiring people to do nothing. What a waste! As shareholders, you should have been outraged. **That money was yours**. It's human nature to waste money. It is beyond the ability of any human being to be prudent with money in the face of a river of cash with no accountability. Dividends impose fiscal discipline.\n\nFor a company to retain dividends, they need to *generate a higher return than their own current cashflow*. In other words, they need a higher Internal Rate of Return (IRR) than what they have right now. That''s a huge ask for any company to do consistently over years. You think Google is profitable right now? Well, they're promising that they'll get even *more* profitable over the years. If you think this can continue forever...well, that's your gamble to make.\n\n*5. Re-investing Dividends Gets you more of the Same Proven Cash Flow*\n\nWhen you re-invest your dividends, you're purchasing more of the same cashflow that the company has proven **they can already generate**. It's not pie-in-the-sky \"trust me bro\" cashflow. You know the company's track record. You know its record of dividend growth. You're buying more of the same. It's more secure.\n\n*6. A Company is Not the Same as its Stock*\n\nThe English used to have a saying:\n\n**\"Milk from the cows, eggs from the hens. A stock, by God, for its dividends!\"**\n\nPeople mistakenly think that a company and its stock are the same thing. They are not. A stock is a financial instrument that is valued only for its current or future cash flow. A company is well...a company.\n\nFor example, Google is a great company. Cash rich, and growing. It's stock, however, is dog shit. It pays nothing, and I value it as 0.\n\n*7. When a Company Fails, All You're Left with is Dividends*\n\nCompanies grow and die. During the life cycle of a company, the only value it ever actually returns to its shareholders is through dividends. During liquidation, chances are that it's in distress and that shareholders won't get the value of the company's assets, so that's a poor way to ensure you get something out of it in the end.\n\nImagine the journey of Meta. It grows to tremendous heights, and 30 years later is dies. At the end of it, what did shareholders get if it paid no dividends? When a company finally closes its doors, you will be glad that it paid you dividends. At least you got something out of it.\n\n*8. Without Dividends (Present or Future) a Stock is No different from Bitcoin*\n\nWhat makes Bitcoin a joke? The lack of cashflow. What gives a house value? The cashflow - either directly from rent, or the amount of rent you save from living in it.\n\nWhat gives a stock value? Not company earnings, which have no impact on you. Dividends. By god, dividends! People who substitute company earnings for dividends are making the mistake as point (6). A company is not the same as its stock.\n\n*9. I Invest Based on the Gordon Equation*\n\nThe Gordon equation (a variation of the dividend discount model) is simple:\n\nExpected yield = Current yield + growth of that yield.\n\nFor example, Microsoft's yield is low. But it's growing that yield fast, so I consider it. Google pays nothing. I value it at zero.\n\n**Bottom Line**\n\nNo one denies that companies need to retain *some* earnings to grow. No one is demanding that you chase yields and expect 5, 6, 7, or 8% dividends. 3 or 4% is plenty. Leaves enough for the company to continue growing, imposes decent fiscal discipline on a company's cashflow, and returns actual value to shareholders.\n\nThat's my strategy, and I'm sticking to it.\n\nEdit: For those of you reaching out, worried about me being attacked here, don't worry. I'm 41 years and a grown ass adult. Words won't hurt me :)",

    "selftext": "TLDR: Swapping from Edward Jones to Schwab and looking for traditional IRA and other recommendations. \\*Apologies for the following novel!\n\n\r  \nHey folks, I am looking for some strategic advice. I started investing three years ago when I finished active-duty military service. My wife and I stupidly didn\u2019t save or invest any money during my 20 years of service, so no IRAs or TSP starting off. We collectively were living paycheck-to-paycheck during my military service based on terrible spending habits.\n\n\r  \nIn 2021 we sold a house which netted us around $150k. We bought another (at 2.499 interest) but put very little down because we used our VA loan and I wanted to feel the security of having cash on hand. We have kept the rest of the proceeds in the breakdown below. Not really knowing what I was doing, I opened accounts with Edward Jones and started throwing money at it. We were able to open the Roth's based on my income then, but have since become ineligible to add to those due to high income. Also, we bought all of the individual stocks and watched them plummet in 2022, but they have since recovered and we are basically back where we started.\n\n\r  \nFast-forward to now, we still spend what I consider a ridiculous amount of money every month, but we are working to correct it and double-down on investing for retirement. I started working with a great company that does a 5% match with John Hancock, and I am maxing that contribution every year (about $20k) with 75% into RFHTX and 25% into the 500 Index Fund. I am not looking to change that allocation unless folks have a compelling recommendation. Additionally, we have roughly $5k/month that is unused (saved) and put in our normal bank savings account which is really giving us no return, about 60 dollars a month, so not really sure what to do there\u2026 I should note that I plan to work for at least the next 15-20 years and expect my current income level to remain static or increase.\r  \n\n\nSo my questions are: \r  \n\\-\tAs we are moving into Schwab, what index funds or ETFs would make the most sense for the Roth IRAs?\r  \n\\-\tShould we be maxing out Traditional IRAs with the intent to do a backdoor conversion later? \r  \n\\-\tWhat should be done with the cash that we have in our bank\u2019s low-interest savings account?\r  \n\\-\tAre we on track or do I need to make some drastic move like taking savings and paying off vehicles / dropping the savings into my mortgage to reduce it / other?\r  \n\r  \nOne thought I have is to make the transition to Schwab and put the Roth\u2019s/529s into whatever the advisor recommends. Then liquidating the $50,000 in individual stocks from EJ, put that money into a MMF with Schwab and use that money to fund Traditional IRAs for my wife and I. Would this be a smart move?\r  \n\r  \nBelow are some of our financial stats:\r  \nAge: 44 \u2013 seeking to retire between 60-65 y.o.\r  \nCurrent take home (net) income: $20,000/mo\r  \n\\-\t$12,000 from employment\r  \n\\-\t$8,000 from military retirement & VA disability\r  \nMonthly bills: $10,000/month\r  \nDiscretionary spending: $5,000/mo\r  \nCurrent 401k: $88,000\r  \n(Edward Jones) Existing Roth IRAs: $20,000\r  \nUSAA Savings account: $90,000\r  \n(Edward Jones) Kid\u2019s 529s: $8,000 (although both kids have GI Bill, so won\u2019t likely \u201cneed\u201d the 529s)\r  \n(Edward Jones) Individual stock positions: $50,000\r  \n\\-\tAlphabet (100 shares)\r  \n\\-\tAmazon (60)\r  \n\\-\tApple (50)\r  \n\\-\tBlackrock (5)\r  \n\\-\tDuke Energy (10)\r  \n\\-\tMeta (20)\r  \n\\-\tMicrosoft (10)\r  \n\\-\tSouthwest (100)\r  \n\\-\tDisney (20)\r  \n",

I also like the new approach of Meta and with LLAMA there is also huge Potential. NVIDIA is of course also a no brainer (even if some ppl think they are overvalued), they are way ahead of other companys like AMD right now. Amazon while not having insane LLMs right now, has of course on of the best Sectors to apply AI in general.  \n\n\nWith alphabet i have to say, im not so sure.

    "title": "1 year follow-up on buying the dip on pandemic stocks",
    "selftext": "Last year there was a post asking what folks were doing to profit from the current/upcoming recession on Hacker News: [https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33040211](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33040211)\n\nI replied ([https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33041751](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33041751)) that I purchased some pandemic stocks, which I started doing in April 2022. Most of my purchasing was through summer 2022, but I've bought others more recently, like Carvana on the dip in December (which luckily popped since it became a meme stock), as well as Meta, Amazon and Google on the dips in October. The most recent was Allbirds on the dip in March since I had just purchased the shoes and they quickly became my favorite.\n\nOverall, I'm up 36%, but as you can imagine a few winners (which I luckily have larger stakes in) make up for the losers. My target timeline is \\~3 years, and we could still see a deeper recession from a hard landing, so I plan to post more annual updates.\n\nThere were multiple lots of some stocks, so I've summarized each with the overall unrealized gain/loss so far as of this morning:\n\n* Affirm: -11.33%\n* Amazon: +25.25%\n* Allbirds: +9.43%\n* Coinbase: -34.32%\n* Carvana: +306.5%\n* Google: +29.35%\n* Meta: +170.89%\n* Cloudflare: +14.35%\n* Netflix: +97.08%\n* Peloton: -54.61%\n* Roblox: +25.14%\n* Shopify: +39.26%\n* Snapchat: +3.21%\n* Snowflake: +11.14%\n* Unity: +8.91%\n\n**Some commentary**\n\nIt's hard to convey how much of a roller coaster the the last 12 months have been, with some pretty large negative swings that I just had to watch and not react to. There are likely more to come, especially since it seems a lot of the potential good news is already priced in.\n\nInterestingly, in that post I mentioned Peloton was one I regretted almost instantly, and is now my worst performer by far. Unfortunately, greed got the best of me and I caught that falling knife buying a few times as the stock dropped further. I was hoping they would get rid of the excess inventory, improve distribution and double down on subscriptions to turn things around, but that hasn't materialized. Maybe it still will, or they get acquired.\n\nDespite the strong gains, I still feel Shopify (improved focus, strong brand), Netflix (new ad tier, other new streaming services struggling and likely to go back to content), and Meta (improved targeting post privacy changes + AI opportunities) still have good upside potential.\n\nI also really like Microsoft due to their enterprise moat and opportunities with AI, but their stock never had the correction the other stocks did and that was the scent I was chasing at the time (right or wrong). But long-term, I also wonder if AI will negate the need for human productivity software since the AI can just do it and review/edit mode requires less bloat (e.g. video with Final Cut Pro vs. TikTok, or images with Photoshop vs. Instagram). I wouldn't doubt if we see an AI-native productivity suite that doesn't just integrate AI, but predicated on simplfy reviewing AI generated content.\n\nI'm disappointed to have missed Nvidia (up 3X since October) since I used to own it and have been watching it since the crypto bust created excess inventory and a predictable dip, then the AI trend led to the recovery. The valuation feels rich, but could easily grow into it given the trajectory of AI, unless the hyperscalers make their own chips.\n\nPerhaps counterintuitively, it seems it's more useful to read/listen to tech/business analysts than financial analysts/stock pickers since, at the end of the day, you need to make your own decisions about the fundamentals and prospects of the business. Financials are a good indicator of fundamentals, but by definition backward looking while valuation is forward looking.\n\nI'm curious to see how these perform if the US enters a broader recession in the next 18 months. I don't plan to sell unless something catastrophic happens and I see a better opportunity to shift to.\n\n**Update \\~6mo later here:** https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/17mzc07/15\\_year\\_followup\\_on\\_buying\\_the\\_dip\\_on\\_pandemic/",

Even following the recent market adjustment, **Apple** boasts a valuation exceeding $2.6 trillion, with **Microsoft** at $2.34 trillion, and **Alphabet** at $1.56 trillion.\n\nHow can this be? **Don't large tech firms also face the threat of economic downturns?**\n\nIndeed, they do. However, the members of the MAMAA conglomerate (Meta, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet) took proactive measures to prepare for a potential economic slowdown by decreasing spending, which included a **reduction in labor costs**...\n\nThe recent **turbulence in the U.S. banking sector** has further funneled funds into the tech industry. Investors have shown a preference for companies boasting substantial profit margins and large cash reserves over more traditional safe-haven assets.\n\nAnother factor driving growth has been the **surge in Artificial Intelligence**. Investors anticipate that the capital injected into this sector will yield increased sales and, subsequently, elevated profits. Microsoft, for instance, anticipates a 6.7 percent revenue increase in the current quarter due to the rising demand for AI solutions.\n\nHeading into 2023, the IT sector strikes a somewhat subdued chord: the Nasdaq Index suffered a decline of almost 33% in 2022. However, with **decreasing inflation** and the **prospect of a pause in Fed rate hikes**, tech stocks have regained their allure.\n\nOne also should not forget to note that key support propping up Nasdaq members was **stock buybacks**. Recall, too, that both Alphabet and Apple recently announced buybacks amounting to $70 billion and $90 billion respectively. Additionally, Meta, formerly Facebook, announced a stock buyback of $40 billion.\n\nWhat lies on the horizon? **What are the analysts' predictions?**\n\nMichael Landsberg, Chief Investment Officer at Landsberg Bennett Private Wealth Management, asserts that [large tech stocks are currently overvalued](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/megacap-tech-stocks-out-of-control-big-tech-still-has-the-power-to-extend-the-rally-and-weather-an-economic-storm-analysts-say-a60b6bc3). For example, Microsoft shares trade at a price-to-earnings ratio of 34.3, while Amazon's PE ratio (TTM) stands at 273.79.\n\nOn the other hand, analysts at Bank of America [do not foresee any reason for alarm](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/worries-over-big-tech-driving-135954915.html), and they predict that the flourishing market will persist.\n\nSo **what should we anticipate next?** If the Fed deviates from its hawkish stance, the rally could possibly extend. If not, the recent market correction may appear minor in comparison to what could transpire. Additionally, the approaching debt ceiling deadline could provoke another stock market adjustment, as new Treasury debt issuance could drain Fed reserves and curtail liquidity.",

None of his back and forth podcasts in the last few months convinced me, more like made him suspicious.\n\nSundra Pichai said yesterday that Google will meta tag all AI-created images from day 1, including a nice watermark on them. Also, it launched a fact check tool to find out if the content or news is misleading or not (the big concern with all this AI boom)\n\nI have already seen a few dangerous applications our there. For example some people on LinkedIn happy with many new releases that are illegal under the Data Privacy Act. Things like you can use an AI website where you put a name and it gives you a lot of social media information about this person, or prompt the AI the profile you need to recruit and it will pull up a lot of profiles with photos, information from career, social media information of candidates who are suitable, with their email addresses. I never authorized my profile to be on these AI sites other than LinkedIn (which I kept private and visible only to HR profiles), and now my profile, picture, and info. \n\nGoogle will become the voice politicians, regulators and society is looking at. Beucaseu they are in the business since the late 90's. They know what regulations means.

The company is \"becoming more efficient so we can build better products faster and put ourselves in a stronger position to deliver our long term vision,\" he said.\n\nMeta's Reality Labs unit, which is developing the virtual reality and augmented reality technologies for the metaverse, brought in $339 million in sales but logged an operating loss of $3.99 billion. The company added that operating losses in Reality Labs will increase this year.  \n\nNet income companywide fell 24% to $5.71 billion, or $2.20 per share, from $7.47 billion, or $2.72 per share, in the same quarter last year.\n\nRestructuring charges reduced Meta's earnings per share by 44 cents.\n\nMeta said that total expenses for 2023 will be in the range of $86 billion to $90 billion. That figure includes restructuring costs that range between $3 billion to $5 billion.\n\nCapital expenditures will remain in the range of $30 billion to 33 billion. That figure accounts for its increased artificial intelligence investments and its ad-supported products like the newsfeed and Reels, the company said.\n\nThe after-market rally further boosted a stock that's been on an upward trend since Zuckerberg announced in February that 2023 would be the company's \"year of efficiency.\"\n\nThe shares lost two-thirds of their value in 2022, but were up 74% this year, prior to the earnings report. Including the post-report surge on Wednesday to over $234, the shares are up about 164% from their November 2022 low of around $89.\n\nInvestors have rallied around Zuckerberg's plans to slim down his company through a series of layoffs, resulting in some 21,000 expected job cuts. The revenue base had been shrinking from a battered online advertising market and the lingering effects of Apple's 2021 iOS privacy update that dramatically limited ad-targeting capabilities.",

It is a \"fund of funds\" with the following composition:\n\n* Avantis U.S. Equity ETF (42.78%)\n* Avantis U.S. Large Cap Value ETF (15.05%)\n* Avantis International Equity ETF (10.89%)\n* Avantis Emerging Markets Equity ETF (6.37%)\n* Avantis International Large Cap Value ETF (5.49%)\n* Avantis U.S. Small Cap Value ETF (4.95%)\n* Avantis U.S Small Cap Equity ETF (4.86%)\n* Avantis Emerging Markets Value ETF (4.28%)\n* Avantis Real Estate ETF (3.00%)\n* Avantis International Small Cap Value ETF (2.17%)\n* State Street Institutional Investment Trust US Government Money Market Fund Institutional (0.09%)\n\nI got this information from the website [etf.com/avge](https://etf.com/avge). But I would like to go further. I would not like to see the funds that make up these funds, I want to see the holdings that make up the funds of that fund.\n\nSo, with a little bit of programming I was able to extract this information and publish it in this github repository. There are two CSV, of which:\n\n* [avge-holdings-ungrouped.csv](https://github.com/victornoleto/avge-holdings/blob/master/avge-holdings-ungrouped.csv): In this CSV I have not grouped the repeated companies. You will be able to see the weight of each holding in each of the funds. Example: APPL represents 4.78% of AVUS (which represents 42.78% of AVGE) and at the same time represents 2.98% of AVLV (which represents 15.05% of AVGE).\n* [avge-holdings-grouped.csv](https://github.com/victornoleto/avge-holdings/blob/master/avge-holdings-grouped.csv): This CSV shows the actual participation of a given company in AVGE. So, for example, the APPL that is part of AVUS and AVLG, its real weight is 2.49% (4.78%\\*42.78% + 2.98%\\*15.05%).\n\nAnd, just to make the post more graphic, I end with the list of the 10 biggest AVGE positions.\n\n|Name|Ticker|Weight|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Apple Inc.|AAPL|2.49%|\n|Microsoft Corporation|MSFT|1.56%|\n|Exxon Mobil Corporation|XOM|0.92%|\n|Meta Platforms Inc. Class A|META|0.85%|\n|JPMorgan Chase & Co|JPM|0.80%|\n|Chevron Corporation|CVX|0.77%|\n|Merck & Co., Inc|MRK|0.76%|\n|Alphabet Inc. Class A|GOOGL|0.63%|\n|Pfizer Inc|PFE|0.56%|\n|Alphabet Inc. Class C|GOOG|0.55%|\n\nThe fund's 10 largest positions add up to **9.91%**. It's a pretty small value when compared to growth ETFs like QQQ, VUG, etc.\n\n# Next goals (which I will do when I have time):\n\n* Compare the percentage portfolio between AVGE and VT;\n* Get the country and sector of each of the 9824 holdings. In this way I will be able to carry out a study of the geographic and sectorial diversification of AVGE. I'll probably use ChatGPT to help me with this because I haven't found any api that can give me this information easily.",

Adjusted operating income margins exceeded 40%, which puts Zoominfo in a rare category of meaningful profitability among higher-growth technology companies. But the key issue with last evening\u2019s financial report had to do with its outlook: 2023 is only projected to grow at high teens. Not bad for any company to be forecasting double digit growth in a recessionary environment, but expectations for Zoominfo had been higher, especially in the light of historical performance.\n\nKey Highlights from Q4 2022 Report\n\nThe technology sector has been laying off employees since early-to-mid 2022 to reduce overheads and prepare for potentially weaker business volumes. Even giants like Salesforce (CRM -2.15%\u2193) and Meta (META -2.25%\u2193) could not avoid the fate as recessionary pressures continued unabated and markets demanded to see higher profitability.\n\nWith 40% of its customer base originating from the software vertical and a largely seat-base revenue model, Zoominfo faced increasingly stacked odds in 2022. While it had enjoyed extraordinary growth in tandem with prevalent hiring in the technology sector back in 2021, those tailwinds recently turned into headwinds. Trying to retain accounts and win new ones when customers (exiting and potential) were retrenching became a tall order.",

And that large negative reactions are more likely to be overreactions. Or at least that the probability of them going up in combination with the lower price would make the expected value appealing. Also, the parameters (how large is the drop, over what period, and how long do you hold before selling) would need to be tinkered with, but I think you get the point. Maybe you even add some additional parameter related to fundamentals in, like as long as their credit rating is above BBB, as long as their leverage is below a certain point, as long as they're cash flow positive and have been around for at least 5 years. I don't know. You could take it in several directions. I'm sure someone with a data analysis background could run all sorts of regressions and shit analyzing what characteristics the funds that came back from a 30%+ drop tended to have in common. \n\nObviously I'm not saying this fund would necessarily be a winner, but I think it's at least worth exploring if only as an intellectual exercise. for instance, netflix dropped 35% in a day last year but has since climbed back 95%. meta dropped almost 30% in a day in the past year and they're up 26% from the point that 30% dropped from.",

To be clear, I still think they are good buys (especially now), that\u2019s just a concern I have thought about\n\nSo here\u2019s my case on why you should buy Apple for the next 5+ years \n\nOver the next 5-10 years, I believe more 3rd world countries will start adopting technology even more than they already have.

Now, nobody really knows how far in production the car is, but a lot of people are reporting it would be released in 3 years (2026). I don\u2019t think that Apple will release it unless it\u2019s perfect, but if they do than it will probably be a huge hit. \n\nLastly, Apple has bought more AI software firms than any other company (including meta).

    "title": "Can we talk about investing in AI - How do you handle a hot commodity?",
    "selftext": "I have been following this field since new techniques in machine learning basically brought AI out of a dormancy in the 2012-2014 time frame.   There is no question the field of AI holds great potential and also great peril, like any technology it can be used for good or evil.  As investors, we look to identify opportunities before the rest of the market does, and hopefully, if we're nimble enough, we can make some money.\n\nThe subject I'm on is really the subject of HYPE around AI.  Since the beginning of the year (or really since Oct), the market in \"all things AI\" has just gone crazy.   Some stocks have recently doubled (C3.ai).  Many companies are jumping on the AI bandwagon, pivoting to spin their offerings to include some AI component.   This \"morning briefing\" from yahoo illustrates the buzz generating.  [https://newsletters.yahoo.net/H/2/v60000018630b0112d9e30726e96c660c0/4fc402b9-f414-4c5c-b036-5ff6110d2b19/HTML](https://newsletters.yahoo.net/H/2/v60000018630b0112d9e30726e96c660c0/4fc402b9-f414-4c5c-b036-5ff6110d2b19/HTML)\n\nSo I'm trying to test my thesis on whats investible, vs what is ethereal.   \n\nAI is going to permeate many processes in the business world.   Reports are at ChatGPT is the fastest technology to a million users from introduction.  [Open.AI](https://Open.AI), the creator of ChatGPT, is not a public company however.   Large Language Models are disruptive.  Google's core business of advertising appears to have the potential to be under threat by a competitive Microsoft Bing offering that provides \"just answers\" rather than a string of links from paid advertisers as google search does.\n\nWhat these examples point to is the idea the our world can change quickly.   Google, Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, Apple and similar players in China, Baidu, Alibaba, Tencent, are all investing in and running experiments on identifying where AI can be monetized for their businesses.   But I think these are the wrong places to look.   None of these business are going to transform their core businesses to become AI-centric.\n\nSo who is really AI-centric?     I can think of a handful of AI chip startups that have mostly failed.   I can think of a number of software companies ([C3.ai](https://C3.ai), PLTR, Unity, even Adobe appears be moving in that direction).  And there are a jillion software startups, but they are not really investible at this point unless you're a VC.  [https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/generative-ai-a-creative-new-world/](https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/generative-ai-a-creative-new-world/)\n\nTo me, there is only one company making money in AI at this point:  Nvidia.   They have a unique parallel processor that's been repurposed from PC gaming and now their machine learning business is larger than their core gaming business.   They have built a platform to tackle one of the largest AI problems, self driving, and are investing in another platform, called Omniverse that uses AI to help generate and simulate digital twin virtual worlds.   What makes them unique is they are investing in the basic research (digital biology, particle physics, medicine etc), and they have a moat around their hardware/software solution that appears to be keeping competition (AMD, Intel, QCOM) at bay.\n\nI've been invested in Nvidia for a while, and I was fortunate enough to initiate new positions in October, the problem with Nvidia is their valuations have now been stretched beyond reasonableness (again) by hype, for example, today's PE is 95 or something ridiculous.  The question to me is whether this is a long term ride, or whether to try and time the market in or out, or push back from the table and cash in the chips?\n\nThe AI hype train is just really getting rolling at what I would call the ordinary consumer level mainly due to ChatGPT.  And these hype cycles will oscillate.   My inclination is just stay long and bear the swings out as I've never been good at market timing.   \n\nSo my question is, what's your personal philosophy for managing a hot commodity?    Dip in dip out?   Ride up and down come hell or high water.   Or maybe a hybrid where you hold a core and try and time buys and sells of smaller blocks, like dollar cost averaging up and down?\n\nEither way, AI is really just getting off the ground.  This is one company making money in the space and I think they've got 10 years or more of growth ahead.",

    "selftext": "I'm looking to create a portfolio with relatively safe tech growth stocks. I know that sounds like a bit of an oxymoron, but I'm looking to diversify out of my AAPL position. 77% of my portfolio is in the s&p 500. The rest is in AAPL.\n\nI don't think AAPL is going anywhere, and they obviously have a loyal customer base and I think Apple TV is putting out some great content. I also love how vertically integrated they are. That being said, I think they've reached market saturation in most areas and it seems the pace of innovation has slowed. I'm thinking about selling 50%+ of my AAPL position because over the years it has grown to represent 23% of my portfolio and that just seems like too much for any one individual stock.\n\nI'm considering divesting and reallocating into the following positions:\n\nGOOGL\nMSFT\nAMZN\nTSM\nNVDA\nMETA\nTSLA\n\n1. Google needs no introduction, but the stock is at super low p/e ratios and they continuously try (mostly unsuccessfully) to innovate across multiple sectors. Ads are obviously the bread and butter, but YouTube is the biggest threat to cable and streaming services. YouTube content is vast, high quality, and free!\n\n2. Microsoft is also at pretty low p/e ratios. Azure is #2 cloud service. Gaming sector is growing and Sony/PlayStation is falling behind. Biggest thing for me is their investment into AI tech such as OpenAI (aka chatGPT). Overall they have diverse revenue streams and continue to innovate.\n\n3. Amazon is not just ecommerce, but at absolute logistics giant. #1 cloud service. Decent streaming service. And they continuously reinvest into the company. They're also down more than others on this list in the past year.\n\n4. Taiwanese Semiconductor is the world's leading chip manufacturer. P/e is low, but partly because of inflated chip prices. Biggest fear is Chinese government interference, but the $40 billion investment into the Arizona factory is encouraging.\n\n5. Nvidia makes the most powerful chips in the world and has great partnerships with other leaders in tech. Also one of the leaders in AI technology. Downside is sky high p/e and it's down the least over the last year, so not the best value.\n\n6. META for me is the hardest to evaluate. On one hand Facebook and Instagram are absolute social media giants that print money, but on the other hand I don't see nearly as much potential for growth. VR technology is cool, but it's a long way away from being mainstream. If that ever happens, there's no guarantee that META will be the ones to do it.\n\n7. Tesla has obviously been hammered the most on this list, but I'm not sure it's totally warranted. Whatever Musk is doing at Twitter shouldn't really affect Tesla as much as it has. P/e ratio is back to reality somewhat and they continue to lead ev sales. Other manufacturers are struggling to catch up, it's happening, but much slower than anyone expected. If Tesla continues to keep it's foot on the gas and continues to improve it's qc and manufacturing processes, I see them remaining a leader in the ev field for years to come.\n\n\nSo Reddit, what do you think of my choices? And are there any other companies you think I missed and should look into? What percentage would you allocate into the above companies?",

    "selftext": "Breaking down Meta Platforms, Inc. (META) and Amazon (AMZN) ahead of their upcoming earnings results to see if investors might want to finally buy these beaten-down tech stocks.\n\n**The Nasdaq climbed again through mid-afternoon trading on Friday, alongside the wider market as Wall Street continues to buy tech stocks**\n\n>meta exclusive news\uff1a[https://www.reddit.com/r/TopInvestment\\_CA/comments/10an9pr/us\\_stock\\_marketdow\\_futures\\_steady\\_after\\_cpi\\_eases/](https://www.reddit.com/r/TopInvestment_CA/comments/10an9pr/us_stock_marketdow_futures_steady_after_cpi_eases/)\n\nThe market faced a big test mid-week and the bulls won out, for now, helping push the S&P 500 back above its 50-day and 200-day moving averages and the 4000 level.\n\nMore importantly, the Nasdaq jumped above its 200-day moving average for the first time in roughly a year. The market has bought up Tesla since its report, with the stock up 10% in back-to-back sessions. Microsoft stock has already erased its post-earnings pullback to extend its bullish start to 2023.\n\n**The broadly upbeat start to the busy part of quarterly earnings season suggests that Wall Street thinks the earnings downturn is already mostly priced in. If the outlook for earnings does indeed hold up, the market could easily extend its recent bullishness.**\n\nPlus, Wall Street feels the Fed is all but certain to roll out a 0.25% rate hike when its FOMC meeting concludes on February 1. Investors also appear convinced that a Fed pivot is on the horizon sooner than later.\n\nThis upbeat market backdrop likely has more and more investors wondering if it is time to dive back into the beaten-down tech titans, with Meta Platforms (META) and Amazon (AMZN) as the primary examples.\n\nMeta, formerly Facebook, reports its Q4 FY22 financial results on February 1. The social media giant posted its second consecutive revenue drop in Q3, while its metaverse bet is off to a brutal start.\n\nMeta\u2019s growth days are no doubt over for now. But Wall Street spent a long time beating down the stock to help it more accurately reflect where Meta is in its lifecycle.\n\nMeta's valuation is looking enticing and let\u2019s not forget that it still reached 3.7 billion people a month across Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp and nearly 3 billion daily. Meta stock has soared around 70% off its November lows, as investors start to dive back into the company for its ability to play a dominant role in a crucial area of the digital economy and venture into new areas with a balance sheet that\u2019s still very impressive.\n\n**Like Meta, Amazon stock has suffered a massive fall from grace as it too made big bets and faces a major slowdown from its days of huge growth.**\n\nAmazon is set to release its Q4 fiscal 2022 results on February 2. AMZN, under the guidance of CEO Andy Jassy, is fighting to cut costs where it can as it aims to slim down a business that expands from e-commerce and cloud computing to an online pharmacy and movie and TV production.\n\nAmazon\u2019s growth is slowing, but it is still projected to expand its top line by roughly 9% in FY22 and Y23, which is no easy task for a firm set to pull in $510 billion in revenue in fiscal 2022. Amazon is still down over 40% from its peaks, including its nearly 25% climb in January.\n\n&#x200B;",

Additionally, fewer employees will be able to achieve high marks compared to previous years. During a recent all-hands meeting, Google executives revealed details about the new review system for its employees. This new system will take effect next year. \n> \n> According to a report by CNBC, under the new system, Google estimates that 6 per cent of full-time employees will fall into a low-ranking category. This will put them in the high-risk category, which could even end up in termination. The report suggests that Google will take corrective action for these employees. Just for context, Google marks only 2 per cent of employees under the current system. \n\n> In an internal meeting earlier this month, Google CEO Sundar Pichai did not rule out the possibility of a layoff. The lower 6 per cent of the employees correspond with the report claiming that 10,000 Google employees will be removed from their jobs in 2023. The new review system will aid the management to take that decision. The tech sector in US has been reeling with job cuts as most of the top brands are laying off a record number of employees. Compamies like Meta, Amazon, Twitter and Salesforce have decided to shrink their workforce.",

    "selftext": "It's a bit disappointing to see so much discourse about Meta that just isn't rooted in reality. It's pretty amazing to me how we can get information so wrong even when its publicly available. I'll just go over some common narratives that just miss the point and then I'll go over the principle of what is going on with Meta's stock price.\n\nFalse Narratives\n\n1. **Meta stock is declining because people are not using Meta's Family of Apps.** There are more people using Meta's products more than ever. You can read their earnings. Their daily and monthly active users are up. I think there was one quarter in which Meta reported lower DAU/MAU and suddenly there's a narrative that everyone is fleeing their products. This is just not rooted in reality\n2. **Meta can't compete with TikTok.** This narrative I can't really say isn't rooted in reality but from their earnings, their Reels views is up 50%. It could be the case that Meta can't compete with TikTok but it's unclear to me given the evidence that this the case. At first glance, it seems like Reels growth of 50% is pretty good.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere are just a couple off the top of my head that is a bit frustrating because it feels lazy to just circle jerk a narrative without even considering the facts.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe whole point of the stock drop is because Mark and Meta's leadership team has decided to invest 10 billion dollars a year in developing the Metaverse. The core business is surprisingly strong.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere are 2 sides to this position that Mark has put Meta in.\n\n1. You believe immersive technology with AR/VR is the future of computing and this investment in the Metaverse creates a technological moat for Meta.\n2. You don't believe such immersive technology is possible within the next 5-10 years and the investment into the Metaverse is a waste.\n\nAnyone who tells you with certainty that (1) or (2) is true is presenting you with an opinion. The point is that no one really knows.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe stock price is reflective that more capital has position (2) where they don't believe the investment is worth it. It certainly can be the case that technology has its limits and this kind of technological capability just isn't possible to get good enough where it gets mainstream adoption within the next 5-10 years.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHowever, it could also be the case that Mark is right. The future is AR/VR and the 'Metaverse' is successful. If certainly can be the case that the technology can get good enough where it gets mainstream adoption.\n\nI can't tell you what's going to happen in the future but right now it seems like most people are betting against Meta but that doesn't mean Meta is going to fail. However, if people do bet on Mark and Meta and they turn out to be right, then they have much bigger upside because the stock price is lowering because it seems like most people do not believe in Meta's vision.\n\nI'm not sure I believe in Meta's vision but just because I don't does not automatically mean its destined to fail. **The real conversion to have about Meta is whether we believe that such immersive AR/VR technologies can improve to a point where mainstream will adopt it within the next 5-10 years.**",
