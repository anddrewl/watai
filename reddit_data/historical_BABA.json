Sold before today\u2019s pop :( and they\u2019re worth $52ish last I checked but whatever.\n\nHonestly I wish I never found this sub, I can\u2019t remember the last time I didn\u2019t file the 3k loss on my taxes. I just kept putting money into random options while scouring this sub.\n\nAt the worst point I had lost 120k of my own hard earned money. Throughout the years I had made the money back through some crazy WSB plays (GymeStonk, Iron net, etc) and within a couple days I\u2019d be back to a huge loss. \n\nI finally started looking for value plays with LEAPS and my biggest option play were these BABA calls. I bought them with a year and a half DTE with half of my account value. For some reason I wanted to hold for at least a year because I had a feeling and here we are. It was hard to stomach the ups and down constantly but it paid off.\nI think I\u2019m done for a long time, I keep checking Robinhood for my next play out of habit but I think I\u2019m going to delete the app after withdrawing it all. I put most of my BP in SGOV for now for dividends.\n\nMy advice: If you\u2019re young and naive and lurking in this sub, don\u2019t start trading options, I honestly got lucky. Maybe use a small percentage of your income for risky plays but not your entire investing budget like I did.\n\nThanks regards, I learned a lot from this sub and maybe I\u2019ll be back in a couple of years but for now, goodbye and good luck.",

    "selftext": "**Short background on my investing journey**\n\nStarted investing June 2020 with \u00a315k. Through pure dumb luck I\u2019ve turned it into \u00a3500k. Started off just copy trading anything that was pumping on here. First big score was $NIO at $11, sold at $50. Then followed a popular poster in here at the time, SirJackalot into a certain banned meme stock and came out with \u00a3300k.\n\nThought I was a genius, made life changing money doing all the wrong things, so I proceeded to nearly throw it all away losing money on every garbage piece of shit you guys shilled me. Wish, Baba, RKT, Palantir (yeah I even managed to lose on PLTR), CLF, every weed stock, you name it, I bag held it.\n\nWent all in AMD (Hence the name) for 2 years of sideways pain, finally sold with a tiny gain. Which leads me to my current play HUT 8. Loaded up when market cap dropped below their BTC holdings after a short report in early 2024.\n\n**HUT 8**\n\n**AI/HPC Pivot**\n\nBitcoin mining is a dying business. Due to the halving, profits are halved every 4 years. Many bitcoin miners are pivoting to hosting AI HPC data centres, which provide more reliable sources of revenue. Even miners like Cleanspark who marketed themselves as 'The last pure play bitcoin miner' are discussing pivoting. These miners have been quietly scooping up cheap power for years and I believe this is not fully priced in and there is a lot of money to be made.\n\nHUT 8 recently announced plans to develop four new sites across the US. Including a 1000MW data centre in Texas and a 300 MW called RiverBend in Louisiana which will be upgrading to 1000MW. Stage 1 for the Riverbend site is expected to be completed by Q4 2025. Therefore I believe an announcement for a deal with a hyper scaler is imminent.\n\nHUT has a huge power pipeline of 10,800MW with 3100 MW capacity under exclusivity and 7700 Capacity under diligence.\n\n**Bitcoin mining carveout (Creation of American Bitcoin)**\n\nHUT 8 has gone into partnership with the Trump brothers Eric and Don Jr to create American Bitcoin ($ABTC). HUT 8 gave away all of their miners for an 80% stake in the company. HUT 8 has pretty much given away 20% of its miners for the Trump brand. Why would they do this? Like it or not the Trump name carries premium. The most expensive stock on the market is $DJT. $DJT is sitting at a $5B market cap despite only doing $1.3m in revenue so far this year. This is by far the most overvalued company on the stock market IMO. ABTC did a private raise worth $220m bringing in the Winklevoss twins which diluted HUT 8's share from 80% to 64% which puts the value at the time of the private raise just north of $1B. They then used the cash raised to upgrade their EH/s from 10 to 24.2.\n\nABTC has currently been public 2 weeks and as I currently sit here $ABTC is currently trading at $7.82 which puts the market cap at $7.1B and values HUT 8's 64% share at $4.5B despite HUT 8's Market cap being $4B itself while also holding 10k Bitcoin worth $1.2B on the balance sheet. ABTC is set up to be self funded and will be able to raise cash at absurd levels compared to what HUT 8 previously could without the Trump brothers while not diluting HUT 8 shares. I love this because I am extremely bullish on the AI HPC/ Energy Infrastructure side of the business and I don't want to be diluted to fund EH/s growth or the straight purchase of Bitcoin.",

    "selftext": "Photronics, Inc. ($PLAB)\u00a0is a global leader in the photomask industry, a critical component of semiconductor manufacturing. Photomasks serve as the templates that transfer intricate circuit patterns on silicon wafers during photolithography. Their core customers are TSMC, Intel, Samsung, UMC, and other chip foundries.\n\nWith 10-15% market share, Photronics is one of the leaders of the photomask industry. Semiconductor spend in 2025 is slated to be near \\~200B, approaching \\~1T by 2030, which is why you see high flying valuations on chip companies. Of course, Photronics benefits from this rise as well, growing revenue from 550M in 2019 to 850M in 2024.\n\nHowever, Photronics does not benefit from a lofty valuation. As of April 17, Photronics stock price is approximately $17.67, with a market capitalization of\u00a0**\\~$1.14B.**\u00a0The company\u2019s tangible book value per share is estimated at \\~$19.50, implying the stock trades at a price-to-tangible-book (P/TBV) ratio of \\~0.92. This is notably lower than the semiconductor industry median P/TBV of \\~3.12.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lmn0iv0dkgve1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=ab1ab9da485ad88a9decc6957fef3d0757286c07\n\nTrading at such a steep discount to book value is typically reserved for companies with poor operations. However, Photronics is deeply profitable. In Q4 2024, Photronics reported a record operating margin of 28.5%. ROE is \\~14.29%. Fiscal 2024 net income was $130M. Operating income is closer to $200M. At 1.14B market cap, it trades at under 6x operating income, among the lowest in the industry.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ft30tb9ckgve1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=30b34ad0f8ba759625eafae867c1f7c381b0220d\n\nLet's take that 200M of operating income and conduct a DCF to get a valuation.\u00a0Assuming analysts are correct in their projected 6-7% revenue CAGR, which seems reasonable considering the projected growth of the semiconductor industry.\u00a0Photomasks have a \\~7.9% projected CAGR as an industry.\u00a0Look at projected capex growth of their customer chipmakers, with\u00a0TSMC's \\~30% capex growth from 30B in 2024 to 40B in 2025.\n\nLet's be extra conservative and go for 5% growth.\n\nI'll use a discount rate of 10% and terminal growth rate of 2% for a 20-year DCF.\n\nSumming up the present values of 200M growing at 5% for 20 years, we get\u00a0**$2443M.**\u00a0The operating income after 20 years would be \\~540M, with a terminal value of\u00a0**$1005M.**\n\nCombining the present value of cash flow and terminal value, for a 20-year DCF with conservative variables, I calculate a\u00a0**3448M**\u00a0present value for Photronics.\n\nThe stock is at\u00a0**$17.67/share at**\u00a0**1.14B today, 3.5B valuation represents over 200% upside to $54/share.**\n\nThat's not all.\n\nFor the tariff traders, Photronics is uniquely shielded. The company operates a photomask manufacturing facility in\u00a0**Boise, Idaho**. They are basically the only US domestic photomask producer. If the US was serious about building a domestically sourced chip manufacturing industry, they would have to use Photronics, because you cannot create semiconductors without photomasks. This introduces unique optionality in the catastrophic event of true deglobalization.\n\nHow has the stock responded to tariffs?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zhyt5brakgve1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=d913b0a67622bc1781c0e3e8f921e94c4c6c739b\n\nDown significantly for some reason.

Garbage, dying industry, so we're expecting to pay dirt cheap multiples.\n\nAnd that's exactly what we get. The company trades at a PE of **2.8**, and **1.5x operating income, 5x EV/EBITDA.** You're basically buying the business for this year's and next year's earnings. The company does not have a healthy balance sheet, with debt outweighing tangible assets. However, since they're cash flow positive and have a genuine operating business, it's less of a concern, and they just refinanced their debt, showing there's confidence in the long term cash flows.\n\nDeep value multiples set the stage for a massive margin of safety. But that's not what makes this stock interesting.\n\nThis guy's in Trump's pocket. He helped him get elected, twice, using his media platform to help the campaign. The Sinclair stations have a famously conservative tilt.\n\nWhat's the catalyst? [Trump just ordered the FCC to pursue deregulation](https://www.fcc.gov/consumer-governmental-affairs/fcc-seeks-comment-about-new-deregulatory-initiative). The FCC is asking the industry to tell them every regulation they should slash and why. Their response is due **today, April 11,** with reply comments due on the 28th. I don't think it's a far stretch that the CEO, with his connections to the Trump administration, is preparing for a massive deregulation that could help him expand.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hdl7hgcjp8ue1.png?width=323&format=png&auto=webp&s=3e3bf6aa4cf0a2c410a2d3dd8f7f6d055e9913cb\n\nThe company[ restructured their debt in January](https://sbgi.net/sinclair-enters-into-agreement-with-creditors-on-liquidity-enhancing-transaction/) in order to free up liquidity in the short term, potentially for expansion. Would make sense in the context of deregulation.\n\nHow about state-sponsored media? We know Trump loves television, wouldn't Trump TV pop off? Sinclair would certainly be the host. Their subsidiary Free State aims to assist local and federal government with developing and broadcasting advertising and campaigning. [Here's a snippet:](https://freestategov.com/)\n\n>Free State's mission is to provide the federal government, along with state and local agencies, a full suite of targeted digital marketing and advertising solutions to help government agencies communicate with the American public effectively and efficiently.\n\n**My position:**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9f0e5lvjo8ue1.png?width=961&format=png&auto=webp&s=d94e7e1102c1a2c67649d65199ce9d873e5fe115\n\n**My recent DD performance:**\n\nLong Alibaba ($BABA): +25%, as high as +80%.  \nLong Long Term Care Industry: \\~Flat  \nLong Gold Miners: $GDXJ +16%  \nShort $MSTR: +30%  \nLong $CNBS: -17%\n\n**TL;DR:** Chairman of massive Trump-backed news media company is buying a massive amount of shares.

    "selftext": "Time for some good old fashioned DD! \n\nHUYA is the ultimate buy of 2025, let me tell you why. \n\nFirst off, China stocks are soaring, nearly every major institution is going long China. HUYA is best of class, owned by Tencent, the management team is all Tencent, one of the best operators in China and here\u2019s the kicker .. HUYA has NO DEBT and $900 Million in cash, current market cap 750M .. YES, you read that correct they are trading for less than their CASH balance. It makes NO sense, and I believe it will be corrected quickly. \n\nHUYA just announced MAJOR news - they are retuning 50% of their market cap back to investors in COLD HARD CASH. HUYA is paying a $1.47 cent dividend in July. That is a 41% dividend yield ! The stock is currently $3.25 per share. Buying now will give you a cost avg around $1.80 for a Tencent Backed growing company. Very few times in life will you find a 40% yield on your cash, this is one of them. \n\nMore news, they are buying back $100M worth of stock. They bought $1M worth of their own shares in ONE DAY and The CEO made an announcement, \u201cwe feel the stock price does not accurately reflect the business or future of the company.\u201d For those that follow China stocks, BABA made an almost identical statement around $72 per share, now look at BABA (up 100% from that announcement) \n\nNext; PATTERNS \u2026. Last year HUYA announced a large dividend of $1.07 - over the following month the stock climbed the entire amount of the dividend plus much more. People, institutions, etc will pour into this company to lock in that massive 40% divided. I expect the stock to climb at least the amount of dividend plus some before July. \n\nFor every 10,000 shares of HUYA you own, you are making $14,700 in cash payment just this year. In my opinion this stock should return to $6.50 before dividend - meaning 100% gains, plus 40% dividend yield. \n\nHUYA is the best stock in the market at this moment. \n\nPosition: LONG 41,000 shares, with plans to buy much more on any dip.

    "title": "A Guide to the Biggest \"IPO\" in History: trashy DD on FNMA and FMCC",
    "selftext": "The guide to the biggest \u201cIPO\u201d in history\n\nHello my highly regarded denizens, and let me introduce you to the upcoming insanity that will be surrounding the release of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac from the bowels of hell, government bureaucracy, and the OTC. I\u2019m going to lead off with a few basic ways to play this, what kind of red flags I\u2019ll be looking for, and some background and context in case you\u2019re not familiar with this HIGHLY unusual situation.\n\nFirst off, there are two securities you can buy here. The first are the common stock: FNMA and FMCC, for each of the companies. You need to think of these as call options with no theta and delta 1. I\u2019m personally weighted heavily towards these since Inauguration but I\u2019ll get more into that momentarily. Then there are the junior preferred shares, each of which correspond to one of the companies and usually share the first few letters: FNMAS, FNMAT, FNMAJ for Fannie, and FMCCH, FMCKJ, and FMCCO for Freddie. \n\nIn case you\u2019ve been living under a rock or are an active subscriber of The Motley Fool, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are the two most profitable companies by employee, and have the largest assets on the face of fucking planet. That\u2019s seven and a half TRILLION dollars in assets. They buy up mortgages from banks, dump \u2018em together in a various pots called securitizations, and basically print money from the payments. Back in 08, the government made a determination based on secret filings that Fannie and Freddie were super dangerous, and would have to print their earnings directly into the Treasury department instead. At the head of this conservatorship, and controlling Fannie and Freddie is the Federal Housing Finance Agency.\n\nCurrently, the US Treasury Department owns a million shares of the Senior Preferred Shares (SPS) at a value of around $200 billion. They ALSO own warrants, equal to diluting the common stock by 80%. The Treasury awarded themselves these shares and warrants after forcing Fannie and Freddie to take a loan out on hypothetical losses in 08, and there\u2019s only three men who can do anything about that. Thankfully, they have a raging boner of hatred for the government.\n\nJunior Preferred Shares (JPS) and commons are both available to common investors, but only through the OTC, so Robinhooders are in shambles (again). JPS are more protected but have capped upside; they have a par value (aka a cap in price) of either $25 or $50, and if dividends get turned on again (only after a release, covered below), they get up to 8% of par first, and then commons get the rest. There\u2019s also a fun added bonus round just to make things more complex: JPS and Freddie commons (but not FNMA) will be getting damages awarded after the presiding judge decided to sign off (after waiting TWO years, and yes, you read that right). FMCKJ will be getting something like $3 in damages, and as of 3/17, was trading at $10. \n\nThen there\u2019s common shares. High risk, ultra high reward. Depending on what kind of scenario plays out, we could see share price hitting anything from sub $2 if you believe somnambulant lawyers, to $34 if you believe Bill Ackman, to price targets that you wouldn\u2019t fucking believe until I lay it all.\n\nRight now, here\u2019s the main events:\n\nRelist: Currently commons and JPS languish in OTC purgatory. 20% pops and drops on zero news, zero halts, and lower liquidity than your mother in her memory care unit. Shambles. Rather than an IPO, the companies can follow a much simpler uplisting procedure to the NYSE This will allow institutions to buy who are restricted from OTC trading, as well as making positions marginable, including OPTIONS. Theoretically, they can uplist at any moment.\nRecap: based on arbitrary regulations, Fannie and Freddie have to have some certain amount of money to backstop the loans they guarantee. How much you ask? It entirely depends on who\u2019s in charge? Back when Mark Calabria was running things, they needed like 4.5% of their book as a reserve! Good thing that those capital requirements didn\u2019t stop payments from running straight out of Fannie and Freddie\u2019s wallet into untraceable Treasury accounts! The specific phrase you need to parsing Twitter headlines is \u201cECRF\u201d, which stands for \u201cEverybody Chill, Release Fannie,\u201d letting you know that if the amount is 1.5%, Fannie will be released within a year (it\u2019s just under the capital threshold). If it\u2019s lower than 1.5%, Fannie can be released IMMEDIATELY. Freddie is a little slower, but he works just as hard you guys, and he won\u2019t be far too far behind. \nRelease: dividends get turned back on, justice is restored, and angelic choirs announce the golden age of America.\n\nSo let me give a couple of the RED FLAGS for free. If you see these, FLEE commons. \nWarrant Exercise. We know you\u2019ve been trying hard to forget that reminder about your license being suspended, but this is definitely one warrant you can\u2019t escape. Diluting the float by 80% would absolutely murder commons with no real hope of reprieve. Your only saving grace might be that OTC tends to trade headlines a day or two slow. \nSPS conversion. Just like a regular conversion, this one will also have you on your knees begging for mercy. Basically another form of dilution.\n\u201cNeed for continued study.\u201d You know how when you had that hot band chick over to study, and you kept trying to touch her hand while going over AP Calc homework, but she got angry that you weren\u2019t paying enough attention to what SHE thought was important? This is like that. Without significant internal pressure, government impetus will stop any relist/recap/release movement simply out of being the fact that they\u2019re collectively lazy and stupid. Given that midterms are going to be a distraction for decision makers only 15 months from now, progress needs to be made, and quickly, before GOP control of all three branches is threatened. Specifically, while some of these comments were made by Scott Bessent (now Treasury Secretary) and Bill Pulte (now FHFA Director), that was before they were confirmed, and based on everything I\u2019m seeing, were statements to basically placate the committees. To get released, these companies will need specific and meaningful policy decisions.\n\nHere\u2019s what I\u2019m IMAGINING for green flags. Seriously, there hasn\u2019t been a lot of public statements made about these companies, but I think for good reasons, mainly political.\nSPS CANCELLED. There\u2019s several good reasons to believe the Treasury\u2019s stock will just straight go to zero. First, the Treasury has been MORE than paid back on the loans they gave going back to 08; altogether, they got paid $340 billion over a $200 billion loan. This raises serious questions about why the government can simply continue to demand money from organizations it \u2018conserves,\u2019 which was one reason why a jury voted 8-0 to give damages in the Fairholme case. The continued existence of SPS brings into question the very notion of property rights in America.\nWarrants to be sold. There\u2019s a lot of speculation about what the Treasury would do with the warrants after a recap/relist. A popular theory is that the Treasury could gradually sell these assets off, and allocate the money to whatever pet project. This seems pretty likely, given talk about a Sovereign Wealth Fund, and similar procedures with confiscated bitcoins etc. There\u2019s some interesting dynamics where warrants could be sold to fund a SWF, which funds real estate development, which pumps FnF, raising warrant values higher, etc.\nWarrants to be CANCELLED. The ultimate bull case. If this happens, commons will launch to Mars and legends will be made. Some say the \u201cgovernment\u201d would never go for this. I say the government is run by the same man who brought us TRUMPCOIN on Inauguration weekend, and we can\u2019t even know if he has a position since filings on OTC are VOLUNTARY. Sure would be quite an ARTFUL DEAL if the decision maker about FHFA actions just so happened to have a position.\n\nSo where are we at with this?\nTrump: a man with significant real estate holdings and a desire to eliminate government agencies wholesale.\nBessent: confirmed Treasury Secretary with a desire to privatize everything in sight.\nPulte: confirmed FHFA director, who on the first day, declared himself Chairman of the Board for FnF and cleared house on the board. \nAt this point I\u2019m basically just waiting for an announcement. It will probably come from Bessent who will declare something about having made an agreement with Pulte to wind down FHFA, but I wouldn\u2019t put it past Trump to announce an executive order just ending it, a la USAID. There hasn\u2019t been much specifically said, but there is a forest of legal red tape surrounding this thing. While there could be progress made on the legal front (final motion in Fairholme damages was finally dismissed after waiting two years, and the case still isn\u2019t even certified!), this is ultimately a political question and it seems like all the stars have aligned. \n\nPositions: I've been selling JPS to capture some more volatility out of commons, I plan to rotate around a bit. \n\n\"But you're already up a lot\" dipshit, tell me if it makes any sense for a $3 dividend to trade at $6. \n\n\"You just want exit liquidity\" you just want to be able to breathe through your nose, but that doesn't stop you from buying BABA with less volume on the NYSE than EITHER Fannie or Freddie on the OTC. \n\nThis post is only for informational purposes, since raccoons are not able to give financial advice. Fuck you and your opposable thumbs.\n",

Anyone who touched the sector was immediately sent to baggy land. The $MJUS ETF got delisted, market caps down 90%+, the AUMs of cannabis funds sliding to zero, there's zero investor confidence.\n\nLook at that shit stain of a chart.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t327lusxasme1.png?width=880&format=png&auto=webp&s=48ab666c7b4de79cc30c7f58738dcb2a15b8090d\n\nGuh\n\nAnyone around in 2021 was familiar with the cannabis bull run. Stinky stoner teens in their moms' basements tossing their stimmy checks at shit like Tilray. It was all garbage. Everyone knew it, but the bet was federal legalization would bake in all the hype valuation.\n\nAfter \ud83e\udd6dleft in 2020, weed bulls were hype for \u267f. Biden hit the office in 2021 and made it clear he didn't care about federal legalization. Efforts in congress grinded to a halt. Momentum faded and so did the share price.\n\nWishful thinking slapped the hand of dipshit trendfollowing retail yet again (I see you, $PLTR baggy!), and has seriously punished anyone holding cannabis over the last 4 years.\n\nBut of course, where there's enough blood in the water, you buy.\n\n$CNBS is basically the last way to get broad exposure to US weed stocks now. All the other ETFs died. Here's what they hold.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nm631kpobsme1.png?width=561&format=png&auto=webp&s=8d67edb3fc075fe0d3f03e08f90f6281d022d766\n\nAnd honestly, the valuations on these companies look **really fucking attractive** now.\n\nLet's crack open Green Thumb, 1.6B market cap.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ssem3fzvbsme1.png?width=933&format=png&auto=webp&s=77242229227d439e25bd3e6eb3f2a92c1c5a9d6a\n\nShare price down 90%+ has led to the company trading for \\~7x operating income.\n\nYou also get $711M of tangible book value. That's basically half the market cap.\n\nOf course, management for all these cannabis stocks were busy smoking the product in 2020-2022 and decided to acquire a bunch of shit for way more than they should have. This has inflated their goodwill on the balance sheet substantially, but their return on tangible assets is actually really good.\n\nYou can calculate the Buffett Return (similar to ROIC/ROA) to get an idea of how they are pushing income on their assets:\n\n**Buffett-style Return Calculation:**\n\n* Buffett-style Return = Owner Earnings / (Inventory + PP&E)\n* Buffett-style Return = $245,012,000 / $550,163,000\n* Buffett-style Return \u2248 0.445 or 44.5%\n\nGreen Thumb looks super attractive **at today's sales and revenue, assuming ZERO growth.**  Their return is quite high, you're getting the business with substantial tangible book value, and at a single digit multiple to operating income. What else could you ask for?\n\nThat is the recurring thesis you will see with these holdings, that pessimism has peaked to the point that **weed could never be federally legal, no future states could choose to legalize, and the valuations here still make sense.**\n\nLet's move to holding #2 Trulieve\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mryat9i7fsme1.png?width=832&format=png&auto=webp&s=5f3e16d1016893fbee1989aea72d2811d36ccdd4\n\nStinky EBITDA after taxes.\n\nWhat sucks about this industry is that the tax bills are massive. They're against the revenue and not the operating income of the business, so there's no real way to avoid them. They're also really, really high. But, it doesn't make Trulieve uninvestible.\n\nAt 775M market cap, Trulieve has 487M in tangible book value, about 2/3 of the market cap. That's a wild margin of safety. COGS and OPEX are also decreasing significantly. It looks like their gross margins are substantially increasing though. The stock looks pretty cheap at \\~4X EBITDA. Even if we use their shitty EBITDA-Taxes, they're trading at \\~7x the 3 year average.\n\nFinally, I want to look at Curaleaf.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/by7x70h2jsme1.png?width=826&format=png&auto=webp&s=4342887167ea0fa5d5d1ba792459fae65266c375\n\nBeautiful profitability and steady with the revenue while increasing their margins. Always great to see.\n\nAt 780M market cap, Curaleaf actually has negative tangible book value of 800M. But you're paying 780M market cap for an amazing reason. The company is trading for about 4X cash flow, easily the best value proposition on an income multiple.\n\n**My position:**\n\nI am currently holding 500 shares long of $CNBS for around $10,000.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pny1ljdejsme1.png?width=862&format=png&auto=webp&s=17e21b417618d101699f7deb0d64d276a5c5bc52\n\nI believe the tariff talk has caught these stocks in an unintentional crossfire considering the close Canadian ties. Obviously the chart technicals don't help.\n\nHonestly, I'm bias towards buying deep value situations under deep investor pessimism. It's [how I made my bags on $BABA](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1h55bbd/china_bad_baba_good_dd/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) which is up over 50% in the past 3 months since posting. These situations where investor emotions are clouding business fundamentals are my bread and butter, and hopefully some people here see the value as well.\n\nI'm comfortable holding a relatively small position in Cannabis. If we don't get legalization, these bets are placed at fair value for their current operations. If we do get legalization in more states, or federal legalization, you know exactly what these stocks are doing. Up, up, up, but downside here is very muted. Asymmetrical risk at its finest.\n\nTL;DR: Buy weed stocks, they're cheap, sentiment is horrible, can't really get worse from here. $CNBS",

    "title": "$PARA YOLO - Undervalued Giant with Massive Upside Potential",
    "selftext": "**Paramount Global ($PARA) is an undervalued giant hiding in plain sight.** The misunderstood fundamentals and exaggerated expectation for the death of traditional media has fueled a shockingly unique opportunity on a company that is fundamentally sound and poised for future growth due to its incredibly strong brands. Despite its negative reputation due to the Shari Redstone mismanagement of M&A and the difficulty that traditional media companies have been facing, $PARA is a massively undervalued media powerhouse with legendary brands in CBS, Nickelodeon, Comedy Central, MTV, Paramount Pictures, etc. This company is a media giant trading at fire sale prices. With a laughably low P/S ratio (\\~0.24) and EV/EBITDA (\\~5x), PARA is far cheaper than its competitors despite looking poised for a recovery, especially with the looming Skydance merger.\n\n\u00a0\n\n**Fundamentals:**\n\nThe fundamentals are honestly simple to me. Paramount has been struggling over the last few years to escape the difficulties that traditional media companies have been facing. They have been ineffective at creating enough revenue and operational efficiency/ focus to make any meaningful impact in their debt since about 2018 when their debt initially exploded upwards. Because of these factors, Wall Street and Retail have both soured on Paramount.\n\nParamount+ has been relatively successful, but the investment has not justified the returns thus far, however this aspect of their business has been steadily improving. In their last quarterly report, Paramount+ added 3.5M new subscribers, showing that the platform is still bringing in new customers. Beyond this, Paramount has exceptionally strong brands that are not going to die, no matter what comes of the future of media.\n\nTo further embolden the case for the intrinsic value hidden within Paramount, here are some of Paramount's Notable Brands: All of CBS, BET, Comedy Central, MTV, Nickelodeon, Showtime, and quite a few more, with all associated brand IP (think SpongeBob, South Park, Avatar, The Daily Show, etc.). Point being, **these are brands that people interact with CONSTANTLY. Hours and hours of attention is spent on these brands each day.** And despite network cable\u2019s viewership \u201cdecreasing\u201d, CBS is still the #1 channel and rakes in about 4.8ish million viewers per day. Attention is the most valuable commodity in our world. Monetization of the traditional media platforms has been challenging, but with new leadership and the huge investment being made, **I am betting that they see incredible opportunity for growth with this company.**\n\nI\u2019d be remiss if I didn\u2019t mention that there are quite a few things that have been stacked against this stock for a long time, most notably the situation with 70% of controlling shares being held by Shari Redstone, who managed the company abysmally and ruined a potentially lucrative buyout for shareholders, making further M&A negotiations chaotic and unpredictable. However, she agreed to sell her control of the company in July of 2024 to Skydance, who will now be controlling the company with their current CEO, David Ellison (the son of Larry Ellison). **Shari being gone and competent leadership coming into the scene is a huge, huge deal. This merger has created a very unique situation for $PARA, which I believe to be a win-win for investors.**\n\n\u00a0\n\nHonestly, though, all of this is drivel. **What matters to me with the Paramount fundamentals is this**:\n\n*Paramount's Market Cap:* $8B flat\n\n*Paramount's TTM Revenue:* $28.9B\n\n*Price to Book Ratio:* .43\n\n*Price to Sales Ratio:* .24 (compare this to Netflix's PS ratio of 11.76, or even $WBD's of .64)\n\n*EV / EBITDA:* \\~5x (compare with Netflix of 17x, Disney \\~10x)\n\nThe debt situation I have seen so much negative sentiment about online appears to be utterly overblown and I honestly don't see how people think this company is financially dying. Let me sum it up as follows:\n\n*Debt to equity:* .94 (fine)\n\n*Debt to assets:* .34 (good)\n\n*Quick ratio:* 1.10\n\n*Net margin:* \\-.06 (trending better, hope this flips positive again soon, but I don't see reason for concern)\n\nQoQ Total and Net Debt has been trending DOWN since Q2 2020\n\nFree cash flow has been stably positive since Q3 of 2023, currently at $762M TTM\n\n*Cash on hand:* $2.44B\n\nSkydance merger will immediately inject $1.5B in capital once closed\n\nThere are deep value stocks, then there are\u2026\u2026.. you know the rest.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n**Technicals:**\n\nGetting into the chart it seems evident to me that price has been pushed down about as far as it can be without something fundamentally changing. I like to buy my stocks at lows and sell them at highs (don\u2019t you?). As you look through my TA, think about whether this price seems like a low or a high to you.\n\nThere are 3 timeframes that I will focus on; the monthly, weekly, and daily.\n\nPlease note that **current price is $11.30** at the time of writing this post\n\n\u00a0\n\n*Monthly*\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yb9zabv1jxje1.png?width=1430&format=png&auto=webp&s=26f05db27a086c13828f255c0689bd27baeeef07\n\nMacro Point of Control: $10.66 (price is above)\n\nMacro Fibonacci Golden Pocket: $10.44-$11.68 (price is within and has held as strong support)\n\nRSI: Bounced off bear zone and has been steadily (though slowly) rising since Feb 2024\n\nMACD: Bullish divergence printed Oct 2023, has been steadily green and rising since Feb 2024, signal cross up in Jan 2024\n\nLastly, volume has been seeing some pretty significant influxes throughout this downtrend it\u2019s been in since 2021 and volume has been consistently higher during this 4-year trend than it\u2019s been at really any point since the 2008/2009 market shenanigans. This may indicate accumulation, especially so since 2024.\n\n\u00a0\n\n*Weekly*\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r8rhzvd4jxje1.png?width=1430&format=png&auto=webp&s=475549c3ca26b39b7f689e96e32796ae2050af68\n\nThe consolidation in the golden pocket is really beautiful. The fact that you had a significant bounce from the .65 to the .5\u00a0*exactly*\u00a0confirms the validity of using fibs on this chart and solidifies this golden pocket range as very strong support.\n\nThe weekly Bollinger Bands have squeezed to their 3rd tightest width in the history of this stock, and the narrowest they've been since January of 2018. Generally speaking, tight BBs lead to explosive price breakouts.\n\nMACD and RSI have been printing bullish divergence for 3 years without much, if any, positive price action following. In my opinion this\u00a0*will*\u00a0change. Reversal in trend\u00a0*is*\u00a0imminent. There is a looming catalyst for this to reverse when the company reports earnings on Feb 26.\n\n\u00a0\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0tv16j253yje1.png?width=1043&format=png&auto=webp&s=4ef26c06db90cd9260b5f2553edfc3083c08b635\n\nThe Weekly ADX is actually beautiful. This is one of the lowest ADX values I've ever seen on a weekly chart for a company as big as $PARA, and it's starting to curl up. Simultaneously DMI+ is going up while DMI- is going down. This looks similar to the ADX setups $TSLA had in October of 2012 before a 535% run, $UPST had in June of 2024 before a 350% run (this one looks the most structurally similar to $PARA in many ways), $COST had in June of 2024 before a 100%+ run, $BABA in Apr 2024 before an 82% run, $INTC in June of 2017 before an 73% run, and $DIS before a 56% run. What I can't find is similar ADX setups that didn't have significant breakouts up or down.\n\n\u00a0\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ppnb1c0fjxje1.png?width=1430&format=png&auto=webp&s=96a4a872f8458bf897d8c5ca09e9899dd67dbf57\n\nAnd how about a Triple Bottom on the weekly RSI just to further solidify my position of being on the precipice of a bullish breakout. It's not perfect, but chart patterns rarely are, and its close enough to be very intriguing.\n\n\u00a0\n\n*Daily*\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/w0b9k1h63yje1.png?width=1195&format=png&auto=webp&s=ac18eef8caa65fbfc7c372e9b433b0d49cfa6a11\n\nThere are two chart patterns that are completing/ have completed. One is a falling wedge; the other is a pennant. The falling wedge has a price target of approximately $25. The pennant has a price target of approximately $5.26. Do you think it\u2019s more likely that this company halves in value again, down to a $4b market cap, or *returns to a more reasonable valuation* of \\~ $20b market cap?\n\nThere are also numerous gaps to the upside on the chart that I expect to be filled once a bullish trend reappears. Gaps are from \\~$19-$23, \\~$34.50-$36, and \\~$85-$91.25.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xgawv1y73yje1.png?width=1316&format=png&auto=webp&s=f7bb02f718152b2fa47168a6ba1c20bef64b68b7\n\n\u00a0The last thing that I want to highlight for is that the 50 and 200 daily moving averages are currently in a $0.20 range. There **will** be a golden cross very, very soon if price holds above $11. Algorithmic traders will rush in when this happens.\n\n\u00a0\n\nTo summarize how bullish the technicals are:\n\n1. Consolidating in a macro golden pocket above the point of control\n2. Bullish divergence on the monthly MACD\n3. 9 touches of bullish divergence on the weekly RSI & MACD\n4. Weekly ADX is completely cracked out and looks poised for a **massive** run\n5. Weekly RSI has a triple bottom with a very bullish outlook\n6. Falling wedge pattern and gaps on the chart point towards a run deep into the $20 range\n7. Daily golden cross is imminent if price holds above $11\n\n\u00a0\n\n**Some fun stuff:**\n\nShort interest is 11% and the Days to Cover is \\~13. While this isn't a huge amount in comparison to some previous meme stonks, this is quite significant for a stock the size of $PARA, and the size of this position is exemplified by the days to cover. When I compared this to Paramount\u2019s competitors, I found that it is 3x-10x the short position of any other company in the sector. Additionally, I pulled the options flow data for the last 9 months to analyze the outstanding bearish premium. What I've found is what I believe to be a ticking time bomb. There is approximately $39M in net bearish put premium that is not closed, and $4M in net bearish call premium. This means that (in my opinion based on my analysis) there is approximately **$43M (22.46M shares worth of contract, or approximately 45% of free float) in net bearish premium yet to be closed**, that, if correct, will dump gasoline on the fire of a run if $PARA begins to break out and these positions are forced to close. These are trades that I believe to be held predominantly by Hedge Funds and institutions, and I believe that they are overexposed on this trade due to the belief that $15 is a price cap until merger. If price reverses and goes beyond the $15 buyout price, a mass unwinding of these positions (both the short positions AND the bearish contracts) will have to take place as the perceived price \"ceiling\" could be shattered.\n\n\u00a0\n\n*Final point:* \\*securing tin foil hat and preparing for berating\\* I believe that the options data I analyzed has uncovered a significant arbitrage play that is in the works. This Skydance-Paramount merger arbitrage trade is a ticking time bomb. Someone has been shorting PARA near $15 and hedging with bearish put options, betting that the deal price caps upside. But if PARA breaks and holds above $15, these trades fall apart, causing the holder to potentially cover their position, put holders to unwind, and institutions to scramble to reposition. This could trigger a cascade of buying pressure, breaking the artificial price ceiling and leading to a massive price surge. If the deal is renegotiated or collapses as a result of this price action, PARA could explode MUCH higher.\n\n\u00a0\n\n**Tldr;**\n\nParamount Global ($PARA) is an absurdly undervalued media giant that Wall Street has pushed down as far as it can, setting up what I believe to be a uniquely explosive opportunity. Despite owning powerhouse brands like CBS, Nickelodeon, MTV, Comedy Central, and Paramount Pictures, $PARA trades at a laughably low valuation\u2014its P/S ratio is just 0.24, its EV/EBITDA is \\~5x, and it\u2019s generating $28.9B in revenue on an $8B market cap. Meanwhile, short interest sits around 10% (\\~12+ days to cover), and I\u2019ve identified $43M in outstanding net bearish premium (45% of free float exposed) still open, which I believe will act as gasoline on the fire if price begins to break out. Adding to the intrigue, the Skydance merger deal has created a forced price ceiling at $15, which institutions have been using to execute merger arbitrage trades\u2014if that ceiling is broken, it could cause mass unwinding of short positions and a re-rating of the stock. Technicals are screaming reversal, with bullish divergence on multiple timeframes, the ADX setup mirroring historic breakout runs ($TSLA, $UPST, $DIS), and an imminent Golden Cross about to happen on the daily chart. If retail sentiment shifts and $PARA starts moving, this could be a perfect storm of undervaluation, squeeze potential, and institutional mispositioning, leading to a rapid and violent price correction to the upside. Everyone is sleeping on $PARA. It's time to wake up.\n\n\u00a0\n\n**Position:**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/iej5r9gr2yje1.png?width=767&format=png&auto=webp&s=a90e58c30122ae12ab6ce4d222eb75559e4fd6c1\n\n3,000 shares @ $11.13 cost basis\n\n200 1/26 12.5Cs @ $.67 cost basis\n\n*\\*\\*\\*Disclaimer\\*\\*\\**\u00a0\n\n*I am writing this due diligence so that other people can learn about a trade that I think may be one of my biggest trades of 2025. Every once in a while, an opportunity on a trade comes across my desk that looks so good I get genuinely excited about it. The OG meme stonk at $10 last year, mcrovst at $.20, $DOCS at $25 (these auto-post deletions based on tickers are annoying af btw) were the other 3 for me last year. I've had success with these big bets of mine in the past year, but past performance does not always indicate future success. Do not invest in something that you have not personally researched, and do not invest unless you have identified clear entry, stop losses, and exit points that work for YOU.This is not financial advice; I am merely sharing my personal excitement about a trade I am making.*\n\n\\*edit\\* - I am aware of the compression causing potato quality in some of the pictures and will fix when I get a minute",

Don\u2019t do what I\u2019m doing as I have other investments apart from those high risk high reward.\n\n\nWhen you are pushed in a corner, you must study read listen watch countless of hours, and I promise you will make it through\n\nWarning : I am heavily invested  in high risk ETFS  I wil name them bellow . I started accumulating this week. \n\nAll Roads lead to Rome; \n\nIn the short term, all signs point to strong returns, driven by America\u2019s economic exceptionalism. I expect significant gains by early or mid-2025 from the following positions:\n\nETF=TNA (3x Small Cap).\n\nETF= UDOW (3x Dow).\n\nETF= FAS (3x Financials).\n\nETF= 3x Bull ETF ether ETHU\n\nWhy not by the end of the year?\nA market correction in the early or mid part of 2025 is a real possibility, which is why I\u2019m positioning for the short term gains \n\nA Key Reminder from a Legendary Investor:\nOne of the most respected fixed-income investors of all time\u2014whom Warren Buffett sought advice from\u2014Mark Howard\u2019s once said:\n\n\u201cThe market can remain irrational longer than you can stay solvent.\u201d\nYou may think the market is overpriced, but the premium you\u2019re paying for American stocks is justified because the U.S. is the world\u2019s greatest economy.\n\nKeep in mind this is from someone that does not invest a penny in securities or seldom does and continues to buy bonds when the 2008 crash occurred he was considered one of the smartest since his portfolio barely took a hit and made billions upon billions afterwards.\n\nHe greatly reminds us that investing is a losers game, and predicting the future is not possible\n\n\nOn  that  note you can for certain know that whatever what happened in the past \n is not a good indication of future Performance , but you can be certain that you can analyze today and today is American economic exceptionalism\n\nFor dummies this means that there is no greater economy, American exceptionalism was a political word used by the early settlers. Almost every president uses it but today you are actually living it . A beacon light upon a hill, in which the eyes of the world is set up on us, an example to the world.\n\nI have a minor in political science -once I thought it would be useless  to study . I did for fun \n\n\nWhat I Know for Sure:\nWhile I can\u2019t predict what will happen tomorrow, here\u2019s what I can say about today:\n\n**Job Market**\n\nThere\u2019s never been a better time to find a job. Boomers are retiring in large numbers, and younger generations aren\u2019t filling those gaps. With immigration restrictions tightening, job openings will continue to rise.\n\n**Interest Rates & Inflation**\n\nWhether rates go up, down, or stay the same, any shift is just an opportunity to buy. Despite inflation, GDP growth will likely outpace any downturns. All signs point to a strong American economy.\n\n**Political Environment:**\n\nThe new administration may bring volatility and media distractions, but over time, you\u2019ll get used to it.  And the market will get use to it , in fact it will become almost meaningless . \nAs long as the economy remains strong, those disruptions won\u2019t matter.\n\n\n**Final Thought from Warren Buffett:**\nIn Buffett\u2019s words, America is like a train that keeps moving forward, picking up more passengers along the way. Occasionally, it may get derailed or need to stop, but it will always get back on track and keep moving forward.\n\nYou will never know why he sold yet , is it because his age ? is it because he actually believes at the market is overvalued ? if so, he would have listen to Mark Howard\u2019s in his recent interview I believe it is more of a shifting of strategy plus or minus his given age and his future holdings not a reflection of what he believes about the American economy\n\nCurrent holdings : \nPLTR sold 2/3 at 400% gain rest are locked forever \nTSLA 170 average any major dip is honey - the Cinderal story \nBABA - the Chinese awakening \nUber - purchased at 61$ \nHood - 20$\n\nI see other opportunities\n\nTrow - the finance story \nBlock - Finance story \nBroadcom and NVDIA are both to be owned \n\n",

[PCAOB has full access to the accounting for Alibaba](https://pcaobus.org/news-events/news-releases/news-release-detail/pcaob-secures-complete-access-to-inspect-investigate-chinese-firms-for-first-time-in-history#:~:text=Public%20Company%20Accounting%20Oversight%20Board,time%20in%20history%2C%20in%202022); PwC (Big 4) is Alibaba's auditor\n2.

Chinese owners have only ever seen green)\n4. [Alibaba's Qwen AI is topping the charts in model ranking.](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/alibabas-large-language-model-tops-093000912.html)\u00a0(Just don't ask it about Tiannanmen Square)\n5. [China is gearing up a massive stimulus plan.](https://in.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/this-is-when-china-is-likely-to-present-new-significant-fiscal-stimulus-plan-db-4552712)\n\nThese are all certainly catalysts, but I think the fundamental analysis is far more interesting.\n\nBased on their trailing 12 month earnings and current balance sheet, at 200B Market Cap, Alibaba trades on these multiples:\n\n|Multiple|BABA|S&P500|S&P 500 Premium (Discount)|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|P/S|1.5|3.1|106%|\n|P/E|17.7|29.7|67%|\n|Operating Margin|15%|12%|(25%)|\n|P/OI (Operating Income)|10|25.8|158%|\n|Forward P/E|10|24|140%|\n|P/B|1.55|5|223%|\n|P/FCF|11|24.3|121%|\n|EV/EBITDA|8.8|17.5|99%|\n|PEG Ratio (Assuming 5% Growth)|3.5|6|71%|\n\nGeneric fundamental ratios look beautiful compared to the S&P 500 for BABA, but that's just the start.\n\nAlibaba's net book value is highly liquid, with significant portions of its long term assets stored in equity investments. Realistically, Alibaba is both a China ETF with its equity holdings, and a core business.\n\nThus, subtracting book value from the market cap and using operating income gives us a better picture of the market's valuation of Alibaba's earnings (which excludes gains/losses from interest+investments)\n\n|Metric|BABA|SP500|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Market Cap|200B|\\~48T|\n|P/B Ratio|1.5|5|\n|Market Cap - Book  Value|67B|\\~38T|\n|Operating Income|20B|\\~1.86T|\n|Book Value Adj. Market Cap / Operating Income|3.35|\\~20.4|\n\nJust, wow. When you subtract Alibaba's net book value and place a multiple on the operating income alone, Alibaba trades at 3.35x income, as opposed to the SP500 index 20.4. That's a 508% premium for the SP500.\n\nBy the above metrics, Alibaba trades at a 50-75% discount to intrinsic value. Based on the current market cap, that's around 400-600B of intrinsic value.\n\n**But wait! CHINA BAD!**\n\nAbsolutely, China Bad. So, let's caveat this with some data.\n\nAccording to Polymarket, the highest yearly odds of China invading Taiwan is around \\~20%.\n\nLet's be as conservative as possible. Let's use Polymarket's highest yearly odds of China invading Taiwan as the odds of Alibaba stock going to Zero. Assuming Alibaba stock goes to Zero in this circumstance, let's see what the current market cap of Alibaba should be, adjusting for the risk, and using my bear case low end 400B intrinsic value.\n\n|Alibaba Intrinsic Value|Chance of Happening|\n|:-|:-|\n|400B|80%|\n|0 (War with China)|20%|\n\nWe take the calculated intrinsic value example (400B), multiplied by the chance of not going to zero (80%), and end up with 320B market cap, adjusted for the China Bad risk. That's **60% upside** from here.\n\nIn the bull case intrinsic value of 600B, multiplied by 80%, we end up with 480B market cap, adjusted for the China Bad risk. That's **140% upside** from here.\n\nTL;DR: No matter how you slice it, even if you take the most conservative valuation metrics for Alibaba and pair them with the most bearish estimates of chance of war with China, Alibaba is still severely undervalued. Even a China bear could justify owning Alibaba at these prices.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g4g8nxfd2i4e1.jpg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=53ef9d7ff4e35604e0e11b8eddbbd5f734d4dea7\n\nPosition: $600,000 long 6K+ Alibaba shares.\n\nEdit: [Shkreli has opened a BABA position today.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO9PuxeTMxk)",

    "title": "$BABA - The Azure of Asia-Pacific: Cloud Growth Could Send This Rocket to the Moon\u00a0\ud83d\ude80",
    "selftext": "TL;DR\n\nAlibaba ($BABA) is more than just an e-commerce behemoth; its cloud computing division, Alibaba Cloud, is leading the charge in Asia\u2019s explosive cloud growth. With Asia\u2019s cloud market expected to grow at a CAGR of 17.4% by 2028, this sleeping dragon might be your ticket to big gains. Let me break it down.\n\n\n\n1.\u00a0**Alibaba Cloud: The Azure of Asia-Pacific**\n\nIf Amazon has AWS and Microsoft has Azure, then Asia has Alibaba Cloud. It\u2019s already the #1 cloud provider in Asia-Pacific, with close to 40% market share. The division isn\u2019t just following Western models\u2014it\u2019s adapting to local markets and dominating. Countries like China, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand are leveraging Alibaba Cloud as their backbone for digital transformation. **A key differentiator is that unlike Amazon and Microsoft, Alibaba has proprietary GenAI in QWEN that rivals OpenAIs GPT offerings.**\n\nRecent milestones:\n\n\u2022 +7% YoY growth in cloud revenue last quarter, and triple-digit growth in AI\n\n\u2022 Launched Tongyi Qianwen, their ChatGPT competitor, tailored for enterprise solutions, giving them an AI edge. QWEN is ahead of GPT/OpenAI in several categories ([https://venturebeat.com/ai/alibaba-claims-no-1-spot-in-ai-math-models-with-qwen2-math/](https://venturebeat.com/ai/alibaba-claims-no-1-spot-in-ai-math-models-with-qwen2-math/))\u00a0 ([https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/25/technology/china-open-source-ai.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/25/technology/china-open-source-ai.html))\n\n\u2022 Collaboration with ByteDance, NIO, and other Asian giants.\n\nBy aligning with governments and enterprises,\u00a0**Alibaba Cloud is becoming indispensable in Asia\u2019s growing digital economy.**\n\n\n\n2.\u00a0**Asia\u2019s Cloud Market Is on Fire \ud83d\udd25**\n\nAsia-Pacific\u2019s cloud market is expected to grow from $120 billion in 2023 to $264 billion by 2028 (CAGR: 17.4%; this is greater than the US market at \\~12%). Alibaba\u2019s dominance in the region positions it to capture a lion\u2019s share of this pie. Here\u2019s why this is huge:\n\n\u2022 Cloud penetration is still low in Asia compared to the West. With increasing internet adoption, 5G expansion, and government incentives, the growth runway is long.\n\n\u2022 Alibaba\u2019s infrastructure covers 28 global regions and 90+ availability zones, but its home-field advantage in Asia gives it an edge Western competitors can\u2019t match.\n\n\n\n3.\u00a0**The Cloud Is Becoming Alibaba\u2019s Profit Engine**\n\nE-commerce might have built Alibaba, but cloud computing will carry it into the future. This is exactly what happened with Amazon and AWS. Let\u2019s connect the dots:\n\n\u2022\u00a0AWS accounts for 70%+ of Amazon\u2019s operating income.\n\nAlibaba Cloud isn\u2019t there yet, but it\u2019s trending in the same direction. Margins are improving as it scales, and with increased AI adoption, demand for compute resources will only grow.\n\n\u2022\u00a0China\u2019s e-commerce regulation hit BABA hard, but cloud revenue is regulation-light and critical for economic growth. The Chinese government even promotes Alibaba\u2019s cloud adoption for its national digital strategy and helps develop new contracts abroad ([https://www.asiafinancial.com/china-indonesia-sign-10bn-in-deals-on-evs-batteries-solar](https://www.asiafinancial.com/china-indonesia-sign-10bn-in-deals-on-evs-batteries-solar)).\n\n\n\n4.\u00a0**Dirt Cheap Valuation Compared to Western Cloud Giants**\n\nBABA is severely undervalued compared to its US counterparts. Look at this:\n\n|Metric|Alibaba ($BABA)|Microsoft ($MSFT)|Amazon ($AMZN)|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|P/E|10x|34x|62x|\n|Cloud Revenue CAGR|\\~30% in Asia|\\~20% globally|\\~25% globally|\n\nWhy? China FUD. But if you believe in the secular growth trend of cloud computing in Asia, this valuation gap screams opportunity. Also, aside from Asia, Alibaba is constructing a new data center in Mexico ([https://www.theregister.com/2024/05/24/alibaba\\_cloud\\_mexico\\_asia\\_expansion/](https://www.theregister.com/2024/05/24/alibaba_cloud_mexico_asia_expansion/))\n\n\n\n5.\u00a0**The Macro Tailwinds Are Strong**\n\nLet\u2019s not ignore the China reopening play and China\u2019s commitment to stimulate the economy. Add in Beijing\u2019s recent pro-business rhetoric, and $BABA could see significant upside. Plus:\n\n\u2022\u00a0Alibaba\u2019s $25 billion buyback program means it\u2019s returning value to shareholders at an aggressive pace.\n\n\u2022\u00a0Spin-offs on the horizon: The cloud division could IPO in the future, unlocking massive shareholder value. Think AWS spin-off rumors but real. Let\u2019s not forget that ANT \ud83d\udc1c is back!! ([https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jack-ma-backed-ant-profit-121522222.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jack-ma-backed-ant-profit-121522222.html)); ([https://www.scmp.com/tech/big-tech/article/3286177/ant-backed-credit-rating-firm-gets-central-bank-approval-china-after-3-year-wait](https://www.scmp.com/tech/big-tech/article/3286177/ant-backed-credit-rating-firm-gets-central-bank-approval-china-after-3-year-wait))\n\n\n\n6.\u00a0**Price Targets and Risks**\n\n\u2022\u00a0Base case: $150 in 12 months (30% upside).\n\n\u2022\u00a0Bull case: $200+ if cloud growth accelerates (70%+ upside).\n\n\u2022\u00a0Bear case: Regulatory crackdowns re-emerge, though unlikely given current trends. \n\n\n\n**Final Thoughts:**\n\nAlibaba is a rare mix of value and growth with a transformative cloud business that\u2019s only scratching the surface of its potential. The Asian cloud market is exploding, and BABA\u2019s position as the \u201cAzure of Asia\u201d gives it an unbeatable edge. Don\u2019t sleep on this one\u2014when the market realizes the true potential of Alibaba Cloud, $BABA will soar.\n\nOne more thing, it\u2019s chairman Joe Tsai is on a winning-streak. He invested $150M of his family fund into more shares of $BABA, and let\u2019s not forget that the NY Liberty just won the WNBA title. The Brooklyn Nets aren\u2019t there yet, but that doesn\u2019t change that Joe Tsai is one very smart China bull! His strategic vision as chairman is up there with the top CEOs we look-up to today ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8znIj2ML\\_Vo&t=11s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8znIj2ML_Vo&t=11s))\n\n\n\n**P.S. for Key Concerns:**\n\n1. Many of you Apes \ud83e\udd8d fear Chinese investments because of regulatory concerns and the Republic overstepping. We saw what happened after Jack Ma criticized the financial infrastructure and compared it to a pawn shop. Over the years, China realized that they would benefit from leveraging Alibaba\u2019s technology and have shifted their tone and relationship. Here is a recent article from Summer 2024 in China shared that Alibaba is in harmony with the republic ([https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Companies/Alibaba-s-3-year-antitrust-rectification-is-over-Beijing-says](https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Companies/Alibaba-s-3-year-antitrust-rectification-is-over-Beijing-says))\n\n1. Another key China concern since the election are US tariffs moving to 60%. Aside from this being a negotiation tactic that will likely not come to fruition, international e-Commerce is growing for Alibaba and it is not attributed to the US (\\~9% of Alibaba\u2019s international ecommerce is attributed to the US). With news of the Chinese megaport in Peru, South America is going to become a huge importer of Chinese goods TAX-FREE [https://www.wsj.com/world/china-xi-jinping-latin-america-acf6dbc1](https://www.wsj.com/world/china-xi-jinping-latin-america-acf6dbc1)\n\n\n\n  \n**Positions:**\n\nAfter earnings on Friday, I loaded 420 shares of $BABA and 120 $100 calls for 12/6. Across all accounts, I have about 700 shares and am considering leaps into late 2025.",

    "selftext": "***I bought KWEB back in 2019/2020, was living in Asia at the time so it didn't seem that exotic.***\n\nMy feeling (and those around me) was that the China Tech sector would rise to equal or even overtake the US tech sector simply based on population numbers, large amount retail of participation in the share market within China and general interest in this market from the rest of the world. The fantasy tech portfolio would be 50/50 US/China and have some built in currency diversity (so we thought ;-) ). Big CAP tech with separate markets.\n\nEventually that turned out to be a fever dream, it crashed for a number of reasons, including some regulatory issues certain companies had, after the crash I came out flat.\n\nHowever, unlike US large CAP tech, it never recovered and aside from an uptick 2-3 weeks back based on stimulus news, it's been flat!\n\nJust re-invested a couple of weeks ago based on said news (similar to news which regularly causes the US markets to go parabolic) and got burned again when it fizzled out.\n\nThese companies are all still around (Ali Baba, Baidu, Ten Cent et al) and not making losses. But they are priced like QQQ 10 years ago. Buying opportunity, right?\n\nIt's my feeling that one day this (KWEB for example) will wake up and potentially go 2x to 3x in a year or two, which will still make it cheap vs its US counterparts.\n\n***There's the setup, here's the question***\n\nWhat do I do out of the following\n\n1. *Buy the KWEB ETF and potentially hold a potentially nonperforming asset for a long time and suffer the opportunity cost of waiting for some change that kicks off a positive correction*\n2. *Buy the KLIK ETC (KWEB with covered calls) which underperforms KWEB due to it's recent spike, on the assumption it goes back to being flat, and at least I get some dividends while I wait for it to stop flatlining and go up (then if the rally has legs flip to KWEB)*\n3. *Hold a small amount of KWEB, get an alert when it jumps in a day (or intra-day) and then go read the news and see if it seems like a sustainable bull run is now on the cards. If that's the case, buy more*\n\nFull disclosure, I'm currently doing #3.\n\nBTW, anyone know of a free service that can alert you of an intraday (or day to day) % change over say 5% and provide an alert? IBKR makes you put in an actual price level, which is not that useful.\n\nFeedback welcome from all you China bulls, it's hight time we saw some sustained growth!!",

Well what if the company sucks, so buying back their own shares means they could lose more money right? Wrong  \n3. The government will give 'em puts against their own company stocks, up to the amount borrowed. So if the stock drops, the company is covered. \n4. Naturally, the companies that benefit the most from all this are those that can put up collateral \n5. And so who are those? The ones with the best cash on their balance sheets - JD, PDD, BABA, and many others\n\nMost people underestimate all big narratives, and trends last way longer than you'd expect. This seems like the early days of Apple when they first announced their buyback back in 2012. It is up 15X since then!  \n\n\nThat's why everyday is a gap up in some of them Chinese names\n\nLooks like not much could go wrong. Or could it?",

    "selftext": "1.2k turned into 13k, thank you PDD BABA and JD\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jpn7fwmz6hrd1.png?width=1170&format=png&auto=webp&s=06678742be3b04137700b541992a8d9375d90441\n\nI am myself a Chinese citizen, came to the US and studied for 7 years. Now I've worked for 1.5 yrs, just paid off some money I borrowed from my family. Being debt free, I looked into investing 3 months ago, started by doing day trading on a paper account for a few weeks, kind of understood generally how short term trades work, and it certainly helped me in doing 1dte and 0dte SPY options later on.\n\nHowever, with my minimal initial capital, investing in stocks have very diminishing returns. I then thought options is literately perfect. If I loss everything, it doesn't matter, I am young and don't really have much in hand anyway. But if I win big, I can have a meaningful starting capital to do some more stable investing with more meaningful returns. I put a month's paycheck minus rent into options gambling and started the journey right as the July huge dip happened.\n\nFor the next two months, it was really meh, sometimes I win, but there were a few times when I was down 80% and bounced back. My downfall is holding on to gains for too long... and they just fizzle out later (its almost like if I browse WSB daily XD).\n\nAround last week, my mom also gave me a speculative 1.5k for investing in the US, since China has been in a multi-year shit market. She told me exactly which stocks to buy, but gave me free control over 200$ of it in options play.\n\nFinally the day came. Wednesday I turned 200$ into 600$ on PDD calls during trading hours, sold the gains and bought 1.2k worth of OTM PDD, BABA, and JD calls expiring on Friday right before close. Overnight I watched the Hang Seng index, the SSE index, and JD/BABA charts on HSE, and I almost shitted myself... JD rose 10% overnight, and PDD gained 12 dollars. I immediately closed all these positions in the morning.\n\nNow, my initial investment has almost 5x'ed, and my mom's money also 2.5x'ed. I can finally do fun things like the wheel strategy, and investing in stocks will now have meaningful returns. I put almost all my investment money + a bit more deposits into stocks, and left out 500$ to keep gambling in options. I told my mom to do the same with her money, and I will keep doing options with 300$ of it. If somehow I can 10x this, I will pull out the majority into stocks, and repeat with 1000$ for options play. Currently I have already 2x'ed that 500$.\n\nNow my positions...\n\nI still think the Chinese economy is being driven by the ccp into a dumpster, and the stimulus, at least in the near future, won't fix it at all. However, I will continue to ride this wave of Chinese market rally for some time. I think there's gonna be around another week's worth of gains on the table. Though now I have no Chinese options held over the weekend, most of my money are in various Chinese stocks, and they most likely will go into SPXL, MOAT, gold and some selected US stocks after this wave of rally fades.\n\nHopefully next week Chinese stocks make me proud and 10x my options play money again.",

    "selftext": "# Background\n\nChina's economic landscape presents a compelling investment opportunity, particularly in the tech sector, with Alibaba (BABA) standing out as a potential beneficiary. This analysis explores the factors that could drive significant growth in Chinese assets, especially if the United States experiences a recession.\n\n# Attractive Valuation\n\nChinese stocks, including BABA, are currently trading at historically low valuations. This undervaluation creates a substantial upside potential for investors willing to weather short-term volatility. The price-to-earnings ratios of many Chinese tech companies are significantly lower than their Western counterparts, offering a compelling entry point for long-term investors.\n\n# Strategic Stimulus Package\n\nChina's government is strategically timing its large economic stimulus, waiting for clarity on the U.S. presidential election outcome. This calculated approach allows for a targeted stimulus package that can effectively counter any potential trade policies or economic challenges posed by the new administration. Whether facing renewed tariffs under a Trump-like presidency or a continuation of current policies, China will be well-positioned to protect and boost its key industries or Chinese consumers.\n\n[https://www.reuters.com/world/china/chinas-faltering-growth-revives-cash-vouchers-talk-2024-08-16/](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/chinas-faltering-growth-revives-cash-vouchers-talk-2024-08-16/)\n\n# Alibaba's AI Advantage\n\nAlibaba has made significant investments in artificial intelligence, positioning itself at the forefront of this rapidly growing sector. As AI continues to revolutionize various industries, BABA's portfolio of AI investments could see substantial appreciation. The potential for a stock market bubble in the AI sector, fueled by government stimulus, could further amplify returns for BABA shareholders.\n\n[https://archive.ph/xy1tL](https://archive.ph/xy1tL)\n\n[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/alibaba-emerges-major-backer-high-093000728.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/alibaba-emerges-major-backer-high-093000728.html)\n\n# Resilient GDP Growth\n\nDespite global economic headwinds, China's GDP continues to grow, albeit at a more moderate pace than in previous years. As a major player in the Chinese economy, Alibaba's revenue is likely to track this GDP growth closely. This provides a level of stability and growth potential that may be lacking in companies operating in stagnant or contracting economies.\n\n# Capital Flow Dynamics\n\nIn the event of a Western recession, global investors will likely seek growth opportunities elsewhere. China, potentially emerging from its own economic challenges, could become an attractive destination for this \"hot money.\" This influx of capital could significantly boost Chinese asset prices, including BABA's stock.\n\n# Economic Pivot to Tech and Clean Energy\n\nChina is actively transitioning its economy from real estate dependency to a focus on technology and clean energy. The real estate sector's contribution to GDP is projected to decrease from 23% to 14% by 2027, while the tech sector is expected to grow to 23% of the economy. This shift aligns perfectly with Alibaba's core business and investments, potentially leading to outsized growth for the company.\n\n[https://archive.ph/ynG8F](https://archive.ph/ynG8F)\n\n# Mainland Interconnect Catalyst\n\nThe expansion of mainland stock connect programs could serve as a powerful catalyst for BABA's stock price. As Chinese investors gain easier access to Hong Kong-listed shares, they may favor tech giants like Alibaba over traditional real estate investments. This domestic capital shift could provide sustained upward pressure on BABA's valuation.\n\n[https://www.scmp.com/business/article/3275078/alibabas-long-awaited-china-stock-link-may-provide-timely-boost](https://www.scmp.com/business/article/3275078/alibabas-long-awaited-china-stock-link-may-provide-timely-boost)\n\n# Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, the combination of attractive valuations, strategic government support, Alibaba's strong position in AI and the broader tech sector, and favorable capital flow dynamics create a compelling investment case for BABA. While risks remain, including regulatory concerns and geopolitical tensions, the potential rewards for patient investors appear substantial. As China navigates its economic transition and global economic conditions evolve, Alibaba stands poised to capitalize on multiple growth drivers, potentially delivering significant returns to investors who recognize this unique opportunity.",

Look at this shit:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4p6i3s3x3vgd1.png?width=1551&format=png&auto=webp&s=5f505287e9aaf9d7a93016ec76c97b6fba072605\n\nNow, before you post a regarded comment about \"pAsT peRfOrMaNcE dOesNt pReDicT fUtuRe gAinS\" I need you to keep reading.\n\nBetween [sticky inflation](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/federal-reserve-interest-rates-june-2024-meeting-rate-cuts/) and pathetic [wage growth ](https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/us-labor-cost-growth-slows-second-quarter-2024-07-31/)the US consumer is getting spitroasted harder than your mom on swingers night.  Recently, McKinsey [studied](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/consumer-packaged-goods/our-insights/the-state-of-the-us-consumer) how people are spending less, and can you guess where people are cutting back most?  **That's right, fucking furniture.** People are realizing they don't need a $2000 embossed leather sofa when a cheap $99 futon does the trick.  And who's selling all this crappy furniture?  GigaCloud.\n\nOther discount stores have already seen[ sales surge](https://www.benzinga.com/news/24/06/39183754/ollies-surges-on-strong-q1-earnings-raises-financial-outlook-amid-consumer-bargain-hunting) this year.  Right now GCT is a 1.1B company with $200M in cash and tons of FCF.  No wonder institutions are [snapping up shares](https://www.defenseworld.net/2024/08/03/tidal-investments-llc-buys-new-position-in-gigacloud-technology-inc-nasdaqgct.html) with analysts setting a median price target of [$52/share](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/gct/analystestimates).  And if that's not bullish enough... Jim Cramer is [bearish](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/17/cramer-reviews-gigacloud-.html): *\"I don\u2019t think it makes sense to chase this one after a massive run,\u201d he said. \u201cJust feels like an unnecessary risk.\u201d*\n\nFor me, I'm loading up on call options for the $25 and $30 strike.  My current position is 20 contracts each and I'm going to be buying more heading into earnings.\n\n*Bonus for TA regards: The stock dipped below $25.50 this morning, which has been major support level.  It bounced off this level on Feb 20th, March 27th, and May 22nd.  Just saying.*\n\n*this post is not financial advice, DYOR, etc*",

    "selftext": "\u26a0\ufe0f *Attention all traders and holders of Chinese stocks:*  \n*You should read this if you don\u2019t know what a VIE is. Sure, most of you will be repelled by the great wall of text here (so many words!), but you might want to keep this post nearby.*\n\n\n\nHello.  \nYou are aware that Wall Street\u2019s bustling bazaar hosts a veritable Forbidden City of Chinese companies draped in ticker tape rather than silk.  \nToday, I will provide background and data on all allowed Chinese companies listed on three of the largest U.S. stock exchanges: New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), Nasdaq, and NYSE American.\n\nI should note that a bustling troupe of 26 national securities exchanges are registered with the SEC in the United States. Most are owned by the Nasdaq, NYSE, or the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE).\n\nNonetheless, based on data from the [World Federation of Exchanges](https://www.world-exchanges.org) as of August 2023, the NYSE and Nasdaq were the top two exchanges behemoths of the global financial stage, accounting for 42.4% of the total $110.2 trillion in valuation traded across 80 major global exchanges.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f I had a photo of Wall Street to add here, but I'm only allowed to include one attachment.\n\n\n\n**2022 vs. 2023**\n\nAccording to the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, as of January 8, 2024, there were 265 Chinese companies listed on the three U.S. exchanges, with a total market capitalization of $848 billion.  \nThat valuation is down from a year prior\u2014January 9, 2023\u2014when a slightly lower 252 Chinese companies were tracked, but they represented a total market capitalization of $1.03 trillion.\n\nSince January 2023, 24 Chinese companies have entered the spotlight of the three U.S. exchanges, raising $656 million in combined initial public offerings (IPOs). On the other hand, eleven Chinese companies have folded their tents and delisted.\n\n\n\n**China Securities Regulatory Commission**\n\nThe American stock exchanges witnessed a springtime bloom of Chinese IPOs in the first quarter of 2023. However, this listing activity came to an abrupt halt as the clock struck March 31, 2023.\n\nWhy?  \nThe China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) [implemented a revised approval process](https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/china-publishes-offshore-listing-rules-2023-02-17/) for companies going public overseas.\n\nI won\u2019t get into the details, but China has rules to cap foreign investment and ownership in sectors deemed strategic, such as technology.  \nIn the past, those regulations have driven several Chinese firms to the legal gymnastics of a Variable Interest Entity (VIE) structure\u2014a clever contrivance that allowed them to leapfrog domestic constraints.\n\nHowever, under the revised review mechanism, every company, regardless of its corporate ownership structure, must now bow before the [China Securities Regulatory Commission](http://www.csrc.gov.cn/csrc_en/index.shtml) (CSRC) to register its intent to list overseas.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f I had a photo of the CSRC building to add here, but I'm only allowed to include one attachment.\n\n\n\n**The gatekeeper**\n\nTherefore, although the CSRC touted this regulation as a necessary measure for enforcing regulatory compliance and preventing fraud (which is true), it also helps regulators act as gatekeepers poised to block any proposed listing they deem poses a risk to their national security or jeopardizes China's national interests.\n\nThis process is wide-ranging. For instance, it includes an evaluation of the company\u2019s safeguards against disclosing what the Chinese Communist Party considers potential state secrets.  \nBut we\u2019re not talking about top-secret black-ops projects meant to be hidden from international oversight committees. No\u2026 any company that collects personal information on more than one million users requires stern data security review mechanisms for its cross-border data flows.\n\nFor perspective, TikTok has over 150 million users in the U.S. alone and is not subject to the same scrutiny from the Western nations.\n\nCurrently, the CSRC approval process is reportedly taking upward of six months.\n\n\n\n**Audit inspections and investigations in China**\n\nYou\u2019re probably unaware of the HFCAA, so let\u2019s start there.\n\nThe [Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act of 2020](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-bill/945/text) (HFCAA) is a law that requires companies publicly listed on stock exchanges in the U.S. to disclose to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) information on foreign jurisdictions that prevent the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) from conducting inspections.\n\nThat law laid down a stern ultimatum:  \nIf Chinese authorities kept obstructing the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) from inspecting audit firms in China or Hong Kong for three consecutive years, the companies audited by these entities would face a ban from the bustling arenas of the U.S. exchanges.\n\nBasically, either China allowed the PCAOB to inspect the audit firms, or the companies had to change to another auditing firm within three years.\n\nThen, as 2022 waned to its final days (literally, on December 29), President Joe Biden signed a [Consolidated Appropriations Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/2617/text), which contained a provision that will tighten the noose, shortening future timelines from three consecutive years to only two.\n\n\n\n**Once they looked under the rock**\n\nFinally allowed to conduct full investigations of audit firms in mainland China and Hong Kong after over a decade of obstruction, the PCAOB announced the findings of its first round of inspections in May 2023, identifying deficiencies in seven of eight audits conducted by the auditing firms KPMG Huazhen and PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) Hong Kong. [Audits of Chinese Companies Are Highly Deficient, U.S. Regulator Says](https://www.wsj.com/articles/audits-of-chinese-companies-are-highly-deficient-u-s-regulator-says-2da99766)\n\nOn November 30, 2023, the [PCAOB announced fines](https://pcaobus.org/news-events/news-releases/news-release-detail/imposing-7-9-million-in-total-fines-pcaob-sanctions-three-china-based-firms-and-four-individuals-in-historic-settlements) against three audit firms in China, totaling $7.9 million for misconduct. For perspective, that number included the second and third-largest fines ever doled out by the PCAOB.\n\nWhy were the fines so bad?\n\n\n\n**Those sneaky Chinese accountants**\n\nImagine a gaggle of accountants in the far reaches of PwC China and Hong Kong applying for a U.S. auditing curriculum. But alas, these foreign accountants find the U.S. auditing training tests a trifle tedious, so someone came up with the answers and decided to pass them around like a secret note in a schoolroom.\n\nFrom 2018 to 2020, over 1,000 of these busy bees completed their U.S. auditing online exams by copying the answers from two unauthorized apps with a fervor that would make a gossip columnist blush.\n\nWhen confronted with the evidence, PwC China and PwC Hong Kong response: \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\nAnd let me remind you, this happened late last year.  \nBoth firms are expected to provide reasonable assurance that their personnel will act with integrity in connection with internal training and to report their compliance to the PCAOB within 150 days\u2014April 2024.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f I was planning on using an AI-generated image of Chinese accountants cheating, but I'm only allowed to include one attachment.\n\n\n\n**State-owned enterprises**\n\nAccording to the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, this graph represents the total market capitalization of Chinese companies listed in the three U.S. exchanges.\n\n\n\n[Market Capitalization of Listed Chinese Companies](https://preview.redd.it/e8m49xhhh90d1.png?width=2310&format=png&auto=webp&s=204c57b6b9f085aec53fd055753cfb2ee86a6035)\n\n\n\nThe number of listed companies has stayed at around 260.  \nHowever, all Chinese state-owned enterprises (SOEs) have delisted themselves from U.S. exchanges, most of them soon after the PCAOB announced it had secured complete access to Chinese auditors\u2019 records.\n\n\n\n**Variable Interest Entities (VIEs)**\n\nMost traders\u2014and that means you\u2014are unaware that 166 Chinese companies currently listed on the three major U.S. exchanges use a VIE structure.\n\nAs of January 8, 2024, these companies have a market capitalization of $772 billion.  \nFor perspective, that represents **91%** of the total market capitalization of all the Chinese firms listed on the three major U.S. exchanges.\n\n\n\n**What the hell is a VIE?**\n\nIt is a complex corporate structure that grants shareholders contractual claims to control via an offshore shell company without transferring actual ownership in the company.\n\nA Variable Interest Entity (VIE) is a bit like a riverboat casino\u2019s cleverest trick, allowing a company to sell its chips on a foreign table without ever letting the players hold the cards directly.\n\nA VIE is a structure used primarily by companies that wish to partake in the financial streams of another country (the U.S. exchanges) without breaking local laws (Chinese laws) that prevent full ownership.\n\nRemember, Chinese companies structured themselves as VIEs to circumvent China\u2019s restrictions\u2014not U.S. restrictions\u2014on foreign ownership in industries the CCP deems sensitive.\n\nTherefore, when you hold stock in one of these Chinese companies, you\u2019re not officially holding any actual ownership in the company. Because if you did, then that company could be breaking Chinese restrictive caps on foreign investment and ownership.\n\nThat\u2019s why they set up a fa\u00e7ade, or a legal entity, that controls the business on paper, but the true power and profits are funneled back to the company pulling the strings.\n\nGranted, it\u2019s not as shaky as asking a random stranger to hold your shares, but it is crafty, and you should be aware of the risks.\n\n\n\n**Wait. What are the risks?**\n\nYou need to understand that there\u2019s a shadow of *potential* risk looming. Potential.  \nNow, don't mistake me for the town crier of doom; I'm not proclaiming that the sky is falling on these shares. Nor am I declaring that disaster is certain for Chinese stocks.\n\nWhat I am pointing out, however, is the presence of a risk\u2014a subtle beast that might just catch you off guard if you remain unaware.\n\nAnd let\u2019s face it:  \nMost of you are completely oblivious to these issues.\n\nThere are two sides here: \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 & \ud83c\udde8\ud83c\uddf3\n\n\n\n\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\n\nSince July 2021, the SEC has imposed additional disclosure requirements for Chinese companies using a VIE to sell shares in the U.S. These requirements include greater transparency about the relationship between the VIE and its Chinese operating companies.\n\nIn summary, the SEC aims to push VIEs toward the company behind them to offer more clarity on U.S. investor ownership in the Chinese operating company.\n\n\n\n\ud83c\udde8\ud83c\uddf3\n\nOn the other side, Chinese companies that list overseas using a VIE were not required to register their listings with the CSRC, as the VIE is not considered a Chinese company under China\u2019s law.  \nThis is the reason VIEs were used in the first place.\n\nHowever, as I mentioned earlier, after March 31, 2023, the CSRC established requirements for *all* new Chinese companies to register and receive permission before going public overseas\u2014even those planning to use VIE structures.  \nThat\u2019s why there was a boom of Chinese IPOs *before* that deadline.\n\nGranted, on September 14, 2023, a Chinese auto insurance platform became the first company that received the elusive blessing of the CSRC to list, and it did so using a VIE arrangement, breaking the long, dry spell that had plagued Chinese IPOs when she listed on the Nasdaq four days later.\n\nHowever, even though VIEs received some sort of recognition from the CSRC, the VIE corporate structures still hold dubious legal status under China\u2019s laws.  \nRemember, VIEs purpose is to avoid being considered a Chinese company under China\u2019s laws.\n\nSo\u2026 do you see the potential risk here?\n\n\n\n**Umm\u2026 No, I don\u2019t get it.**\n\nThink about it.  \nEither country could potentially increase regulations for VIEs, but if the SEC forces them to be more transparent, the VIE would not be able to circumvent China\u2019s restrictions.  \nThat\u2019s one risk.\n\nAlso, at some point, China\u2019s CSRC might question whether it\u2019s appropriate to recognize a corporate structure that was created to circumvent its laws.\n\nWhich leads me to this:  \nWhat\u2019s keeping the CCP from deciding to start reigning in those VIEs?\n\nThe answer is simple:  \nThey\u2019re not in a hurry to do so because if misfortune should befall, it\u2019ll be the foreign investors who\u2019ll see their assets deflated like a punctured balloon.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f I would've added a nice image or two by now, to balance all the text and make this more appealing, but I'm only allowed to include one attachment.\n\n\n\nIf a VIE-listed company goes private at a lower valuation, businesses fail, or there\u2019s a valuation discrepancy, the enforceability of a VIE\u2019s contractual arrangements is unproven in Chinese courts. With VIE-listed companies, foreign investors\u2019 recourse in the Chinese legal system is as elusive as a catfish\u2019s whisper.\n\n\n\n**Yeah, but that\u2019s unlikely\u2026**\n\nSure. Of course, I\u2019m not saying every Chinese stock will have these issues.  \nBut it can happen. And it has happened.\n\n\n\n**The unlucky case of Luckin Coffee**\n\nDue to the lack of compliance with international audit inspections, Chinese corporate financial statements\u2019 reliability for valuation and investment is not assured.\n\nSuch is the case of Luckin Coffee.  \nIn a bold bid to capture Wall Street\u2019s hearts and wallets, Luckin Coffee showed up dressed in finery, flaunting alluring figures of revenue, operations, and bustling customer traffic.\n\nAt her grand debut, the stock sashayed onto the Nasdaq at $17, swirling up a storm of interested buyers to the tune of [$561 million in capital](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-luckin-coffee-ipo/starbucks-china-challenger-luckin-raises-561-million-in-u-s-ipo-idUSKCN1SM2SH/).\n\nFor a fleeting moment, Luckin shimmered like a star over the financial firmament, boasting a market capitalization that soared to a heady $12 billion, with shares peaking just over $50.\n\nAh, but as the adage goes, *\u2018Truth will out.\u2019*  \nAnd out it came\u2014the revelation of those embroidered numbers caused the company's stock to plummet like a stone tossed from a bridge, leaving a wake of investor losses and culminating in a disgraceful delisting from Nasdaq 13 months after her debut.  \n[Luckin Coffee Drops Nasdaq Appeal; Shares to Be Delisted](https://www.wsj.com/articles/luckin-coffee-drops-nasdaq-appeal-shares-to-be-delisted-11593188282)\n\n  \n\ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f I would've added an AI-generated image of a cup of Luckin Coffee jumping from a bridge, but I'm only allowed to include one attachment.\n\n\n\n**Well\u2026 but that won\u2019t happen to me\u2026**\n\nUh-huh. On April 2, 2020, after announcing that employees\u2014including its chief operating officer\u2014falsified 2.2 billion yuan (about $310 million) in sales throughout 2019, Luckin's shares nosedived -80%.\n\nThis is from one of you unluckin bastards:  \n[I've lost 240k on Luckin Coffee, all my life savings. Now I'm broke af.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gveon3/ive_lost_240k_on_luckin_coffee_all_my_life/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)\n\nI\u2019m sure many of you might reckon yourselves immune to a similar debacle since you think you\u2019re smart enough to use stops to escape any runaway losses.  \nIt's time to wake up and smell the Luckin coffee. Chinese news catalysts often strike like lightning at night, and the stops you set under the sun cannot shield you from storms that explode in the moonlight. Dumbass.\n\n\n\n**Chinese regulators can be mercurial**\n\nEven though the PCAOB is currently able to perform its oversight responsibilities, concerns remain around the possibility that Chinese regulators might backtrack, potentially clamping down once again on the PCAOB's ability to access audit firms and personnel across mainland China and Hong Kong.\n\nIf that happens, the PCAOB can quickly declare a negative determination.  \nHOWEVER, this action would only start the countdown under the HFCAA, giving U.S.-listed Chinese companies a window of TWO years to secure services from an auditor in a compliant jurisdiction or face a trading ban. That\u2019s it.\n\nOf course, within that time, Chinese regulators could agree once again to allow access to the PCAOB, thus resetting the two-year countdown without significant consequences.\n\n\n\n**What lurks in the shadows**\n\nAlthough the risk of PCAOB non-compliance looms over these financial engagements, it is the ghost of potentially misconstrued\u2014or, let's say, creatively presented\u2014earnings reports coming to light that should scare you most.  \nOr, on the flip side, present the biggest opportunity.\n\nI believe it is possible that there are several ghosts out there\u2014ghastly financial figures dressed up a tad too finely\u2014lingering in the shadows, unchecked and unchallenged.  \nIf they\u2019re found and unveiled under the harsh spotlight of scrutiny, the fallout would be immediate and severe, leaving investors scrambling.\n\nAnd if that happens, it\u2019s not about diamond-holding through the plunge since the company might opt (or be forced) to delist from the U.S. exchanges.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f I would've added an AI-generated image of an attractive young Chinese ghost woman, implying both the allure of Chinese stocks, but also the risk of getting closer. However, I'm only allowed to include one attachment.\n\n\n\nYou need to understand a crucial concept.  \nMany traders believe that if a company messes up, plunges, and gets delisted, it means the company is basically over\u2014dead.  \nBut that\u2019s not the case here. A delisting does not equal death.\n\nI mean, [Luckin Coffee](https://www.luckincoffee.com) is still out there, alive and kicking.\n\n>16,218 stores and counting, covering 240+ cities across China.\n\nYou would think that a company like that would not be able to cheat on its balance sheet.  \nYeah, just like you would think PwC China would notice 1,000 accountants cheated their way through the U.S. auditing curriculum.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f I would've added an AI-generated image of a Chinese accountant dabbing like a boss for getting his cheated accounting diploma, but I'm only allowed to include one attachment.\n\n\n\nSo\u2026 is it too far-fetched to believe more ghosts might come to light, now that the PCAOB can supervise the numbers?\n\nI mentioned a flip side since you could specialize in tracking everything the PCAOB does.  \nIf you can get a whiff about increased auditing on a certain company, you might decide to play a short position in anticipation of a potential ghost coming to light.  \nBe warned, though, that it\u2019s not as if they tweet out which companies they\u2019re auditing.\n\nIf I were to do it, I would research and join whatever digital saloon young Chinese ledger-keepers convene in. Perhaps I\u2019d stumble upon a post by SumYungGuy or another pleading for advice on how to parley with the PCAOB Laowai making a fuss over his figures. The poor lad's in a pickle, you see, since he cheated the exam and doesn\u2019t know squat.\n\n\n\n**Methodology**\n\nFor the purposes of this table, a company is considered Chinese if:\n\n1. It has been identified as being from the PRC (the People's Republic of China) by the relevant stock exchange;\n2. It lists a PRC address as its principal executive office in filings with the SEC; or\n3. It has a majority of operations in the PRC, including a company structured offshore but whose value is ultimately tied through a relationship in the PRC.\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f *Some Chinese companies that use offshore corporate entities hide or do not identify their primary Chinese corporate domicile in their listing information. This complicates tracing, making it difficult to guarantee that this list captures all Chinese companies registered offshore.*\n\nI should also point out that this list does not include companies domiciled exclusively in Hong Kong or Macau.\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f *Remember, this list only considers Chinese companies listed on three of the largest U.S. stock exchanges: New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), Nasdaq, and NYSE American.*\n\nOh, and btw, this isn\u2019t a list I came up with.  \nThis info was compiled by the [U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission](https://www.uscc.gov). It\u2019s their methodology and list.\n\nSince the majority is a VIE, I\u2019ve marked the ones that are *not* registered as a VIE with an asterisk (\\*).  \nThis is determined using the most recent annual report filed with the SEC.  \nA company is judged to have a VIE if:\n\n1. It explicitly describes using a VIE to conduct all or part of its business operations in China, or\n2. It describes a subsidiary in which it has no direct equity interest but relies on contractual arrangements to exercise control and receive economic benefits from its operations in China.\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f *For companies that have been listed for less than a year, information contained in the company\u2019s most recently updated investment prospectus, as filed with the SEC, is used instead.*\n\n\n\n**Chinese companies listed on U.S. exchanges**\n\nCompanies are arranged by the size of their current market capitalization.  \nAll companies utilize a VIE corporate structure, except those marked with an asterisk (\\*).\n\nBABA Alibaba Group Holding Limited  \nPDD Pinduoduo Inc.  \nNTES NetEase, Inc.  \nJD JD.com, Inc.  \nBIDU Baidu, Inc  \nTCOM Trip.com International, Ltd.  \nTME Tencent Music Entertainment Group  \nLI Li Auto  \nBEKE KE Holdings  \nBGNE BeiGene \\*  \nZTO ZTO Express (Cayman) Inc.  \nYUMC Yum China Holdings Inc.  \nEDU New Oriental Education & Technology Group, Inc.  \nHTHT H World Group Limited \\*  \nNIO NIO Inc.  \nYMM Full Truck Alliance Co. Ltd  \nVIPS Vipshop Holdings Limited  \nTAL TAL Education Group  \nLEGN Legend Biotech \\*  \nMNSO Miniso \\*  \nBZ Kanzhun Limited  \nXPEV Xpeng  \nBILI Bilibili Inc.  \nIQ iQIYI, Inc.  \nHCM HUTCHMED (China) Limited \\*  \nATHM Autohome Inc.  \nQFIN Qifu Technology  \nRLX RLX Technology  \nLU Lufax  \nATAT Atour Lifestyle Holdings \\*  \nWB Weibo Corporation  \nZLAB Zai Lab Limited \\*  \nZKH ZKH Group Ltd \\*  \nYY JOYY Inc.  \nGOTU Gaotu Techedu, Inc.  \nMSC Studio City International Holdings Limited \\*  \nGCT GigaCloud Technology Inc  \nGDS GDS Holdings Limited  \nACMR ACM Research, Inc. \\*  \nHOLI Hollysys Automation Technologies, Ltd. \\*  \nFINV FinVolution Group  \nJKS JinkoSolar Holding Co., Ltd. \\*  \nDQ Daqo New Energy Corp. \\*  \nMOMO Hello Group Inc.  \nCSIQ Canadian Solar Inc. \\*  \nEH Ehang  \nTUYA Tuya Inc.  \nNOAH Noah Holdings Ltd.  \nHUYA HUYA Inc.  \nKC Kingsoft Cloud  \nYALA Yalla \\*\n\nThese are only 51 of the 261 Chinese companies currently listed on the major U.S. exchanges to comply with rule three. I kept the market cap minimum at $750M to allow for some wiggle room.\n\nI mentioned earlier that the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission had 265 tickers, but that was on January 8, 2024. Since then, three companies have been acquired, and the other one has voluntarily delisted.\n\nAs you can confirm, the vast majority is structured as a VIE.\n\n\n\nI was going to include charts to illustrate how several Chinese stocks\u2014aside from the ones with the biggest market caps\u2014tend to display sudden rallies, followed by after-hours reversals.  \nIt is important to recognize them, whether you want to capitalize on them, or avoid them entirely.  \nBut I can't add any more attachments, so...\n\nBesides, it's unlikely that many of you have even read this far without images.\n\n  \nHave a good day.",

Commodities traders: dead. But here's why I'm different: I don't pretend to know anything. \n\nI don't even know a lot about BABA. I mean, it's some kind of shitty Chinese Amazon, right? But instead of trading at forward P/E of fucking 40, it trades at 8x earnings. How do I know that this will normalize? I fucking don't! I don't even know if those numbers are accurate. No one does.\n\nI know it has a lot of cash. Like, a ridiculous amount of cash in proportion to its market cap. It could probably use that cash to increase the share price. Will it do this, through the largest dividend and/or share buyback the world has ever seen? FUCK NO. Would their government disappear all the executives if it tried? I don't know, probably. Who cares?\n\nI also know that its valuation has nothing to do with its financials and is entirely based on risk. Geopolitical risk, internal anti-monopoly political risk, tariff and cold war bullshit risk, Chinese economic stagnation risk. Are these real tangible threats to the forward value of Alibaba? I don't know, maybe. Probably. But WGAF?\n\nWhat matters in investing is stories. A good story wins hearts and minds. And wallets. And Chinese companies, especially BABA, are the most beaten down and unloved garbage on the entire fucking planet. While the whole world rallied around, I don't fucking know, AI or soft landings or things generally not being quite as shitty as everyone expected, China equities have been shittier than anyone has ever seen. Ever. So what am I proposing? A story. A beautiful, heartwarming story.

It also said China aimed to participate in forming more than 20 international standards for AI by that time.\n\nThis comes at a time when China is trying to catch up with the United States in AI development after U.S. company OpenAI shocked the world with its seminal chatbot ChatGPT at the end of 2022.\n Last year, Beijing was active in devising regulations for AI including a licensing regime for ChatGPT-like products in the country.\n\nChinese companies including Alibaba (BABA), Baidu (BIDU), Tencent (OTCPK:TCEHY) (OTCPK:TCTZF) and even startups such as Baichuan and Zhipu are developing their own AI models in an effort to compete with large language models, or LLMs, from the likes of Microsoft (MSFT)-backed OpenAI, and others.\n\nThe draft guidelines aim at \"seizing the early opportunities from the development of the AI industry\", the ministry said.\n\nThe ministry also said that 60% of these prospective standards should be aimed towards serving \"general key technologies and application development projects\".\nFurthermore, it targets to have more than 1,000 companies to adopt and advocate for these new standards.\n\nCompanies around the world are developing their own LLMs. Meta Platforms' (META) Emu Video, Emu Edit, AudioCraft, SeamlessM4T, and Llama 2, Alibaba's (BABA) Tongyi Qianwen 2.0 and Tongyi Wanxiang, Baidu's (BIDU) Ernie Bot, OpenAI's text-to-image tool DALL\u00b7E 3, Alphabet (GOOG) (GOOGL) unit Google's Bard, Samsung's (OTCPK:SSNLF) Gauss, and Getty Images' (GETY) model called Generative AI by Getty Images, are some of the LLMs, among the many, being developed.\n\n\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 The Play \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nThe play is to invest in the underlying components of it, and you should be good for this year\n\nTo simplify, the underlying of these AI chips is $NVDA / Nvidia  who will be utilised whom are already established. \n\n$AMD will also be a substitute to $NVDA  (speaking economics terms) as AMD also has chips coming out. \n\n$TSM is the manufacture of these chips. \n\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80",

I\u2019ve made money from them years ago, but have never felt comfortable taking a strong position in them even though their financials always seem decent. Anyways, I left myself a note in my phone with some rough figures focusing mainly on comparing their financials and site traffic to their competitors. \n\nHas anyone else taken this approach before? I don\u2019t remember what all sites Crown & Coke me sourced this data from, so I\u2019m not sure how accurate it is. I do believe it was all mostly from the same source though so should possibly be comparable. I\u2019ve tried this before quite a while ago and came to basically the same conclusion. \n\nBABA seems to outperform other ecommerce sites such as Amazon, eBay, and Etsy in revenue per visit in spite of having higher bounce rates along with the majority of their consumer base being from countries with much lower median annual incomes than their competitors. \n\nMaybe there\u2019s a flaw in my reasoning or figures, but the last time I did this it convinced me that maybe I should put my money elsewhere and considering how the stock has performed since then I\u2019m glad I did. The PE is tempting, but my instinct says leave this alone completely and don\u2019t bother with taking either side of the trade. If anyone is long or short BABA I\u2019d be interested to hear your reasoning behind your position.",

    "selftext": "Hey there fellow regards. It\u2019s been quite a journey the last few years. I started trading while in college during COVID, turning what was just originally a few thousand into about $300K over two years by going on margin long and short on COVID-affected industries like airlines, cruise ships, shopping malls, pharmaceuticals, and some tech stocks like Zoom, and then of course riding meme stocks up and down until my brokers restricted trading meme stocks and I turned to options, blowing my then-$300K account in about a week. Undeterred and having developed a firm passion (or addiction), I\u2019ve been reading dozens of books and experimenting with a variety of strategies, from making careful entries and exits to idiotic YOLO impulse moves, from gut feelings to careful analyses. I do a little of them all now, though the regarded and emotional (revenge) YOLO moves keep doing me in, usually at times when I\u2019m convinced I\u2019m right and the market is (temporarily) wrong about something and I just start impulsively buying instead of exiting with moderate losses. This mistake wiped me out two months ago on an oversized bet on BABA calls after I first gained recognition here for making $5K a day (and then $10K and later $20K a day; maybe should\u2019ve stuck with $5K). The very same sort of mistake happened again Thursday when I saw Uber, after entering the S&P, showing overbought signals on the RSI and Stochastic lines and a bearish MACD crossover, and triggering my experimental tools for double top, rising wedge, and head and shoulders patterns on several time frames, all while the price impulsively raged higher as if to test my hubris. Who knows, the signals may have been right and it may drop next week as if to spite me, but as John Maynard Keynes once said, \u201cMarkets can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent.\u201d Truth.\n\nFriday was rough, no doubt. I was awake at 4:30 AM watching premarket activity, and things were looking good for my expiring UBER puts after the jobs report triggered bearish initial reactions, but everything reversed upward as soon as the market opened, and I didn\u2019t have time to get out. There were about 10 seconds right at 9:30 when my puts were up, but I doubt there was enough liquidity to sell everything, and I froze as the prices rose with renewed ([baby boomers?](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/s/N5TUUBAEzh)) buying. I have a few big takeaways that came with the pain, including the advice people here gave me to move to Robin Hood to avoid fees on large volume options trades, even as I\u2019ll be probably staying away from such trades for a little while. The good news (good at least for everyone\u2019s ongoing entertainment and for r/thetagang\u2019s loyal business) is that I do still enjoy trading immensely (or am pleasantly addicted to it); moreover, I\u2019m lucky to have a Wendy\u2019s job that pays me well enough to continue funding my education and (gambling) habit. My upcoming year-end Wendy\u2019s bonus is also usually quite large, and I think everyone can guess what I\u2019m going to be doing with it, though I promised myself to break it up into several trades and space out my moves. Furthermore, since there seems to be a bit of interest in following my struggles and triumphs, I may go make a new Reddit account completely devoted to trading. Feel free to DM me for the details or to help me pick a username that\u2019s not randomly generated by Reddit like this one is. Also looking into Discord, if anyone has suggestions of channels to join or ideas for creating a new one.\n\nGoing forward, my strategy will be evolving over time and hopefully will eventually become less YOLO and more stable and analytical. But in the meantime, I\u2019m still going to be continuing many high risk / high reward moves while developing and refining my techniques. You\u2019re welcome to bet against me that I won\u2019t change and will keep blowing up my account; time will tell. Assuming I do improve my ways, the goal would be to become consistently profitable through hedging and risk management and continue to refine the quantitative techniques. Some may ask me at this point why I don\u2019t just try to go work at a hedge fund. And actually, some Wall Street firms, including Jane Street, D. E. Shaw, Two Sigma, and Citadel, do actively recruit students and alumni from research programs I\u2019ve been to; those programs were how I had a chance to [meet Jerome Powell](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/z65h5e/9_days_ago_i_quoted_milton_friedman_to_j_powell/) and ask him [questions](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ylinlf/what_should_i_try_to_ask_jerome_powell_if_i_have/) you all suggested (see the last photo I attached from when I was sitting in that meeting). However, I\u2019m not so sure I\u2019d like the culture working at one of those places (they\u2019re covered a bit in the new book Going Infinite about SBF, as well as some of Michael Lewis\u2019s other books I\u2019ve been reading), and a lot of people consider them evil, so I\u2019d rather do my own self-directed trading for now with paychecks from the Wendy\u2019s I know, as opposed to the one I don\u2019t. I just hope this won\u2019t become my villain origin story.\n\nBesides working on decisiveness to take gains and cut losses and more self-control with the impulse revenge buying, I\u2019m planning to start automating the entering and exiting of trades more in order to remove the human error element (alongside some automated risk management), as well as potentially incorporating some machine learning techniques while I learn them in my part-time masters degrees in math and computer science. There are a lot of interesting differential equations and probability theory ideas that come into play with derivatives trading and hedging, and I\u2019ve been reading about the origins of statistical arbitrage strategies in mathematician and hedge fund manager Edward Thorp\u2019s autobiography, A Man for all Markets. While the inefficiencies his fund was exploiting at the time are no longer as viable since everyone started to understand them, I\u2019m certain there are other opportunities in today\u2019s markets that can be found with enough research and experimentation. I had taken a break from reading his books a few weeks ago when my trades started making lots of money again, but I think I should get back to them now. I also realize WSB is just a bunch of regards hanging out behind a Wendy\u2019s and not an official exchange for rigorous academic discourse, but I see enough insights here to stick around for the interesting discussions alongside the insults, memes, and regrets. So once again, feel free to comment or DM if you\u2019re interested with suggestions for Discord or ideas for a new username, or whatever compliments or insults you want to throw at me. Always the best compliments and insults, of course, are when the market tells us we\u2019re right or rubs it in when we\u2019re wrong; \u201cthe market is always right.\u201d Happy trading!",

    "title": "China's Financial Landscape: A Dance of Decline, Distrust, and Desperation",
    "selftext": "Today, major indices in both Hong Kong and mainland China plummeted to their 2023 lows, leaving many in China bewildered.\n\nJust  a fortnight ago, state-run media outlets heralded a revival in the  capital market and a surge in investment confidence. They underscored  the significance of allowing the populace to earn from stock market  investments.\n\nWith soaring  expectations, people dove into the market. But rather than reaping  gains, they faced a 5% plunge in indices. It may not be as drastic [as what the \"PLUG GUY\" faced](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/15iorgk/do_you_like_money_of_course_you_do_youre_poor/),  but it's still a letdown. True, under a communist regime, things could  escalate to be even grimmer. The lingering question though, is where  does the blame lie?\n\nUnsurprisingly,  the finger is pointed at foreign investors. They astutely withdrew over $44.5 billion in less than a fortnight, triggering the slide in stock  values and the devaluation of the Chinese currency. The outflow mirrors  that of October 2022, a period when the Hang Seng Index reached its  nadir since April 2009, and the yuan dipped to 7.37 (currently at 7.27).\n\nSo, why the foreign exodus?\n\nFirst,  the allure of U.S. interest rates. With soaring yields in the U.S.,  capital is naturally being redirected stateside. Yet, Chinese media  assert that American media outlets have been persuasively urging foreign  investors to pull out. It may seem laughable to us, but they're dead  serious.\n\nSecond, China's own  economic health. Country Garden, the colossal developer, defaulted on  two dollar bond coupons due on Aug. 6, cumulatively worth $22.5 million. They're now in talks with investors.\n\nCountry  Garden's magnitude dwarfs Evergrande, and real estate was once China's  economic linchpin. Presently, it's at the heart of a credit calamity.\n\nAdding  to the woes, July saw a paltry sum of 345.9 billion yuan in new loans, a  figure not seen since 2009. It paints a stark picture of the real  estate and broader economic downturn. The lending well has dried up.\n\nElectric  vehicles were once viewed as China's next economic engine. But the  sector is niche and highly automated, offering limited job prospects.\n\nIntriguingly,  youth unemployment figures have vanished from publications. In  yesteryears, China's youth zealously launched internet startups, only to  be later snapped up by giants like Tencent or Alibaba. But regulatory  clampdowns halted this trend, and tech investments took a hit.\n\nSo, what lies ahead?\n\nCurrently,  the state is pulling all stops to mitigate the crisis. State banks have  been ordered to offload dollars to buoy the yuan, and there's a  suspected influx of capital into the stock market to replace the foreign  void. Today's early trading downturn was likely stemmed by state  interventions.\n\nIn the short run,  this might offer relief. That's why I'm not overly concerned about the 08/30 $85 puts I sold on BABA (9988) in Hong Kong. But the broader  sentiment is bleak, with optimism dwindling, even in local WSB-esque circles.",

I made most of my money from trading  options on several bio/tech companies, namely $Fibrogen $IMGN $ZS $BABA  $CVNA $NVDA $RIVN $BBIO and now $RETA.

Any advice is appreciated\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Seeing people ask about how I knew about the $RETA buyout. I didn't. I saw this flow, which at the time was the only options volume coming in for the entire month, all getting hit at the ask and then 2 days later saw buyout rumors from [this](https://twitter.com/OracleNYSE/status/1684561905208406018?s=20) account on twitter.

    "selftext": "I\u2019ll keep this short and simple. So many of y\u2019all seem to fall for the stock market gambit of buying overpriced companies over and over again. Case in point, kudos to anyone who bought $META at $90 in November. It was in deep value territory with tons of negative sentiment. Now up 250%.\n\nMy goal is to find similarly beaten up stocks which have asymmetric risk and a high chance of big payout. The three names I\u2019ve taken a position in are PayPal, 3M, and Alibaba.\n\nForward PE of all three companies are ridiculously low in their respective industries:\n\nPayPal: 12\n\n3M: 11\n\nAlibaba: 9\n\nAll while return on invested capital and margins are quite high for their industries. Share buybacks are increasing for all of them as well, which is a fantastic sign when they are trading significantly cheaper than their peers.\n\nI\u2019m not going to go over every detail of the financials or business, but similar to meta, there\u2019s very little reason for any of them to have dropped this much other than overblown media hit pieces. They\u2019re financially sound companies. \n\nWould love to hear other viewpoints that think there\u2019s room to gap lower. \n\nTLDR: PYPL < $60, MMM < $100 and BABA < $70 have a lot of value potential imo and are worth a deeper look for anyone interested in making money.",

    "selftext": "Hello again!\n\nThree months ago I made a reddit thread about Investing in Escapism. I took my observations as a gen Z living in SEA and I had good discussions in the previous thread with people sharing their experience and what industries/stocks might benefit from escapism.\n\nMy initial bets were: Alibaba (BABA), Tencent (700), and Meta. They're all doing well and I even added RDDT into my portfolio due to that thread, it's up over 100% now (sadly I haven't bought much of it yet).\n\nI was still exploring into industries like BNPL which are really popular in poorer SEA countries (in Thailand where I live, the government warns that people are using BNPL to pay for food and groceries), and traveling (one redditor raised traveling as another thing to look out for, and from my observation it seems most Gen Z's seem to travel a lot, I see people taking a trip to Japan. I even plan one myself later this year). I ruled out Gaming and Alcoholism. (There was RBLX mentioned too, and it's been doing well this year)  \n  \nWhile I was thinking about Escapism, It hit me that I, too, am one of the target demographic. There is a raising trend about Gen Z who take their finances much more seriously than previous generations. Crypto, trading, stocks are becoming common words. I started investing back when I was 22-23, now I'm 28 and it's changed my life trajectory massively. There are probably many who are also doing this. a gen Z investor/customer will mean a lifetime of commission/fees if a service can make them stick long term.\n\nI'm not familiar with all the financial service or other non-stock space. My initial thought is obviously my broker: IBKR. I've been using their service since 2021 and I'm very happy with them. They have lower fees and global reach for both markets and clients. The financial knowledge in the US is likely the highest of the world, all the cheapest index funds and competitive brokerages are over there. I think the rest of the world will slowly catch up, which could mean positive outlook for IBKR who's positioned to benefit the most from the rise of retail investing (outside of maybe S&P 500 itself due to all the money flowing over there). Coinbase is another that comes to my mind but I haven't looked into it.\n\nI want to hear your thoughts. Which stocks or industries do you think will directly or indirectly benefit the most from the rise of retail investing? \n\nThank you again for reading!\n\n",

    "title": "U.S. Pre-Market Watch Netflix Falls, Chinese E-Commerce Stocks Strengthen, Cryptocurrency Stocks Rally Again",
    "selftext": "Netflix (NFLX) is down about 2.5% pre-market. There are no major headwinds at the moment, but it could be due to yesterday's slowdown in Disney+ subscription growth, coupled with concerns about \u201cstreaming fatigue\u201d. Some investors think the current valuation is too high, so even a slight slowdown could trigger a sell-off.\n\nAlibaba (BABA) and Jingdong (JD) are both up more than 3% premarket. That's likely due to better-than-expected Chinese retail sales data released last night, coupled with the fact that the market is starting to envision the PBoC potentially easing further this month. Also, Ali just announced a new round of share buybacks which the market always buys.\n\nCryptocurrency concepts (e.g. Coinbase, Marathon, Riot) are strong again today, with Bitcoin back above $65,000. There are rumors that the SEC may expedite approval of the Ether ETF (not confirmed yet), but it's clear that the market is \u201cbuying expectations\u201d again.\n\nMy take: \n\nI'm still bullish on Netflix over the long term, but I'm not going to chase it higher at the moment. If they can't find new growth outside of price increases and gaming, the pressure will mount.\n\nMid-cap stocks Risk is high, but so is the potential. If you already hold stocks like BABA or JD, this wave could be a \u201csentiment inflection point\u201d. But remember, the political risk between US and China is still there, don't ignore it.\n\nCrypto stocks I personally don't touch unless I'm on the ultra-short side. These stocks are essentially a magnifying glass for BTC and are too volatile for retail investors.\n\nAnyone planning on taking advantage of Netflix's pullback? Or take advantage of the rise in Chinese stocks to add to their positions?\n\nI'm curious to see what you all do today, with CPI/PPI data out and no major Fed speeches this week, unless there is some big news out of the blue, it's probably going to be a \u201cweird day\u201d with low volume.\n\nSay what you think, only represents personal opinion, does not constitute investment advice!",

    "selftext": "This is a daily watchlist for short-term trading: I might trade all/none of the stocks listed, and even stocks not listed! I am targeting potentially good candidates for short-term trading; I have no opinion on them as investments. The potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting, everything else is secondary.\n\nNews: [US CPI Report For June](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/live-blog/2025-07-15/us-cpi-report-for-june?srnd=homepage-americas)\n\n[**NVDA (NVIDIA)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&p=d)/AMD- NVDA/AMD is now allowed to sell its previously restricted H20/MI308 chips to China after gaining U.S. government approval. This reopens a major demand pipeline and removes a significant geopolitical overhang, boosting investor sentiment around long-term growth prospects. NVDA has hit ATH from this, I'm more interested in AMD today as a trade though just because it's run down compared to NVDA, but I'm interested in seeing if NVDA can break $170. The export clearance marks a shift in U.S. posture toward China and semiconductors and the AI race, suggesting trade tensions are entering a more flexible phase and all that money Jensen \"donated\" to Trump is paying off. This benefits high-end chipmakers, namely AMD/NVDA the most.\n\n[**BABA (Alibaba)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=BABA&p=d)/KC/FXI/all Chinese stocks- The chip export announcement has been interpreted as Trump easing his stance on China, sparking a rally across most Chinese equities. BABA was up nearly 6% premarket, and I'm mainly interested in seeing if we can break daily highs in BABA today, other than that I'm also watching KC, a Chinese datacenter stock. Main risk is that Trump reverses his stance- the TACO trade can cut both ways.\n\n[**MP (MP Materials)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=MP&p=d)\\- The Department of Defense agreed to buy $400M in MP's newly issued preferred stock, taking a 15% stake in the company last week. AAPL is expected to announce a $500M commitment to MP, signaling \"deepening partnerships to localize critical rare-earth supply chains\" (this was announced on FOX news). I doubt this will make as big a spike as the DOD investment because we're so far up already, so not too interested in this stock today, but still worth writing about.",

    "selftext": "Hi guys, so I know this question was asked before. But I hope to hear your opinions on this. I know buying VOO etf and contribute every month is the key. However, I can't ignore the fact that there are some relatively safe mega cap companies with growth potential like NVDA, Amazon, Google. etc. As of now, my portfolio includes NVDA, amazon, google, Apple & baba.\n\nI did a quick calculation on compounding interest for VOO. In 5 years, with an average of 9% return (I am being conservative here), a $50k initial investment with no monthly contribution in VOO could be $76,931. So basically around 50% return after 5 years. If I put $1000 monthly contribution, the amount would be $148,747 after 5 years. This is almost triple.\n\nNow mega caps like amazon, google, NVDA, a 50% increase in their market cap in 5 years is possible. But these companies are 2-3 trillions now. They will certain get bigger but 50% bigger is a lot and pretty sure they won't get triple in 5 years. Looking back 5 most recent years, SP500 has been up 94.58% while Amazon lags behind only 68.57%. Google did better at 139.82%. Apple is 153.9%. Microsoft is 152%. NVDA is a different monster at 1455%.\n\nSo now I start to regret my buying strategy. I should just buy VOO and make monthly contribution, and only keep smaller positions for these stock picks. Am I missing something here? is VOO's compound interest that powerful? is there any downside for investing in SP500 ?",

I am targeting potentially good candidates for short-term trading; I have no opinion on them as investments. The potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting, everything else is secondary.\n\nNews: [Trump Wants Apple To Stop Moving Iphone Production To India](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-15/trump-wants-apple-to-stop-moving-iphone-production-to-india)\n\n[**UNH (UnitedHealth)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=UNH&p=d) \\- The U.S. Department of Justice is conducting a criminal investigation into UnitedHealth Group for \"potential Medicare fraud\" related to its Medicare Advantage business. The probe, active since at least last summer, is looking into \"questionable diagnoses\" to inflate payments from Medicare. UNH dropped close to 40 points yesterday afterhours. Not sure if it'll continue but short biased unless we make some insane move downward even more. The spike premarket was attributed to them denying the news. This news is particularly bad because DOJ confirmed investigation is criminal. Other stocks such as HUM/CVS/CI have moved on this as well.\n\n[**ETOR (eToro)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=ETOR&p=d) \\- eToro's IPO priced at \\~$68 per share, above the expected range of $46\u2013$50, and the stock bounced off \\~$65 off some strong bids. Mainly interested to see if the strong bids at $65 still exist (unlikely but I'll just keep an eye out anyway). Mainly a sector play in C-brokerages and the C-Market, since most of their income is derived from it. Beyond what I highlighted in the IPO analysis post, not interested in this long term. Probably will just trade as a proxy to the C-market in the future and I don't like the structure of their contract for diffs.\n\n[**BABA (Alibaba)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=BABA&p=d) \\- Alibaba reported Q4 revenue of 236.45B yuan, a 7% increase year-over-year, but slightly below analyst expectations of 237.91B yuan. Income from operations nearly doubled to 28.47B yuan driven by improved efficiency and reduced share-based compensation. This has been on a decent run since April 8th (peak fear tariff selloffs). Watching $125 level. Alibaba's cloud division saw an 18% revenue increase, with AI-related product sales posting triple-digit growth.\n\n[**FL (Foot Locker)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=FL&p=d) \\- Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods (DKS) confirmed a $2.4B acquisition of Foot Locker at $24 per share, nearly double Foot Locker's previous closing price. Currently long and interested in seeing if we can converge even closer to $24, but overall don't see any other trade in this except for a reversal of news. Mainly integration challenges and potential antitrust concerns are the big risk, but unlikely with current admin.\n\n[**TSLA (Tesla)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TSLA&p=d) \\- Tesla's stock has risen from $275 to $350 over the past six days but failed to break the $350 level twice. Currently short pretty close to $350, but will bail if we break $350 (probably a lower price level like $345). TSLA has mainly been on a tear (attributed to Musk stepping away from DOGE and returning to TSLA), and the news of Tesla board exploring a new pay deal for the CEO dropped yesterday. Mainly a short play based on how parabolic the stock has been, but will bail as needed.",

Watching $214/$215 in AAPL and seeing if we can make another move higher. Currently long. Obviously this is a 90-day suspension and not actually a guarantee that things will return back to normal. Everything in consumer disc is moving off this news. Risks I'm seeing from this are potential re-escalation of trade tensions and more supply chain disruptions, and I'm thinking of possibly flipping short if we make a massive move upwards.\n\n[**BABA (Alibaba)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=BABA&p=d) **/** [**JD (JD.com)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=JD&p=d)\\- Chinese tech stocks like BABA and JD are also major winners of tariffs, with both up roughly 6%, following the 90-day agreement. Watching $135 level (basically just seeing which Chinese stocks are close to breaking highs). Risks are the same as American stocks. Other notable stocks I like on this are BIDU/TCEHY (trades OTC)\n\n[**PFE (Pfizer)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=PFE&p=d) **/** [**MRK (Merck)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=MRK&p=d) **/** [**JNJ (Johnson & Johnson)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=JNJ&p=d)\\- Trump announced plans to sign an executive order implementing a \"most-favored-nation\" policy to reduce U.S. prescription drug prices by up to 59%. This policy aims to \"align\" U.S. drug prices with the lower prices paid by other countries. Obviously pretty terrible news for anyone investing in pharmaceutical stocks because it affects major revenue sources for this company. The US has limited direct negotiating and mainly relies on private pharmacy benefit managers to negotiate prices in insurance plans currently, which results in sky-high insurance costs. I'm Interested in MRK, we're already broken lows (even during the tariffs) because MRK is highly dependent on Medicare reimbursement (MRK).\n\n[**BP (BP)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=BP&p=d)\\- BP up on reports that several major oil companies, including Shell, Chevron, and ExxonMobil, are evaluating potential takeover bids. BP is considered undervalued, with a market cap of \u00a357B against asset valuations of \\~\u00a3120B. No levels I'm watching at this time. Notably, the last piece of meaningful news on this that I remember was Eliot Management taking a stake, so it pushes the likelihood that they're getting acquired up incrementally.",

    "selftext": "Alibaba has been one of the hardest-hit mega caps in recent years. Regulatory crackdowns, delisting fears, the ANT IPO disaster, and the decoupling of Western capital flows have created a lot of fear.\n\nBut I\u2019ve recently taken a long position anyway. I think there are multiple structural and narrative shifts happening that the market isn\u2019t fully pricing in.\n\n1. The structure has changed. Alibaba is no longer just a big e-commerce business. The six-way restructuring effectively turns it into a tech holding company, with clearer paths to monetization and potential IPOs for its cloud, logistics, and international commerce units. This kind of segmentation creates optionality, especially in a market that\u2019s been spooked by a lack of transparency.\n2. China needs Alibaba to win. There\u2019s a bigger geopolitical incentive in play. As China works to position its domestic capital markets as a viable alternative to the West, it needs companies like Alibaba to function as success stories. Undermining a flagship like this no longer aligns with the broader narrative China is trying to promote globally.\n3. Jack Ma is back After a long stretch of silence and \"self-imposed\" exile, Jack Ma has quietly returned to China. Symbolically, that shift matters. It suggests space is reopening for entrepreneurial leadership in the tech sector. For a country that relies on soft-power credibility to attract capital, this kind of move signals a deliberate reset.\n4. Less vulnerable to tariffs than many peers. Unlike hardware or export-heavy companies, Alibaba\u2019s revenue is primarily domestic. Even its international commerce arms like AliExpress and Lazada operate mostly in Europe, Asia, and emerging markets. It doesn\u2019t rely on physical goods flowing into the U.S. market the way manufacturers or component suppliers do, which reduces its exposure to direct tariff pressure.\n5. Valuation is still bizarrely low. Alibaba generated around $11B in net income last year with 130b in revenue. The market cap is under 300B with a PE under 17 and a more egregious forward PE under 12. With a growing cloud unit, huge AI investment, international infrastructure, and massive logistics capacity, that feels disconnected from reality if you think even modest sentiment recovery is possible.\n\nI\u2019m not dismissing the risk. Chinese equities come with real macro and regulatory concerns. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve kept the position size manageable. But between the restructuring, diversification, and the state\u2019s incentive to make this work, the upside is there for me.\n\nAnyone else long BABA despite the volatility, or disagree?",

Overall, most interested in NVDA at $95/$90 and possibly INTC at $20 if we don't spike off the open. I'm leaning more bearish for today due to the news being announced so early premarket from China, and also from the fear of the US announcing additional tariffs.\n\n[**AAPL (Apple)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AAPL&p=d)\\- AAPL broke $200 premarket following the announcement- mainly due to approximately 20% of AAPL revenue comingfrom China. I'm interested mainly if it breaks $190 intraday. AAPL relies heavily on China for manufacturing, with over 90% of its production based there and newly imposed tariffs are expected to increase AAPL\u2019s annual costs by $8.5B. China adding more tariffs affects AAPL as it is clearly the biggest MAG7 loser of the tariffs. Main risks involve increased production costs, potential price hikes for consumers, and a possible decline in sales volume because our damn phones get far more expensive. Additionally, further escalation in trade tensions could lead to more severe supply chain disruptions. \n\n[**VXX (VIX Short-Term Futures ETN)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=VXX&p=d)\\- I still don't think we've peaked (as I mentioned yesterday). We've spiked to \\~$40 on the VIX ($75 on VXX). I'm interested in seeing how the US will respond to China tariffs before making any significant trades. The risk in the VXX short is based on overnight headlines from China announcing more tariffs (which already happened), and now, waiting for the US to retaliate. Fun.\n\n[**BABA (Alibaba)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=BABA&p=d)**,** [**FXI (China Large-Cap ETF)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=FXI&p=d)**,** [**YINN (China Bull 3X Shares)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=YINN&p=d)**,** [**YANG (China Bear 3X Shares)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=YANG&p=d)**,** [**JD (JD.com)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=JD&p=d)\\- China-related stocks are selling off due to expectations of retaliation from the US. Also currently just a \"watch\", everything hinges on if the US backs off from tariffs or if we escalate. Interested in BABA if it hits $100. If the US announces escalation of tariffs, I'm mainly interested in a YANG buy. This is potentially the largest catalyst since COVID, so one tweet can move the market.\n\nPlease remember YINN/YANG are not meant to be held intraday.",

A sign of escalation and a warning, China is essentially responding in kind that it will give tariffs back (just like 2018). Reduced Chinese investment could result in less liquidity in the markets overall and larger volatility. If you want to see a reminder of how Chinese stocks performed when we got into a trade war, look at 2018-2019. We haven't a seen a meaningful move in these stocks yet, but if there are responses from China in kind to the tariff announcement today, things are going to get volatile,\n\n[**SPY (S&P 500 ETF)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SPY&p=d), [**QQQ (Invesco QQQ)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=QQQ&p=d), VXX, etc. - President Trump is set to unveil new tariffs today but is still finalizing details. Options include a tiered system (10%-20%) or a flat 20% global tariff. We're likely going to see a LOT of incremental headlines today on this until Trump speaks in the Rose Garden; I'll be watching what he says on the websites he posts on, and going for the speed trade on this. He is expected to talk at 4PM Eastern. Obviously, a lot of volatility and uncertainty due to no one knowing what exactly the tariff plans are going to be. The imposition of new tariffs could escalate trade tensions, leading to retaliatory measures from affected countries (which we don't know the extent of how many are affected) and impacting global economic growth.\n\n[**TSLA (Tesla)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TSLA&p=d)\\- Tesla reported preliminary March China deliveries of 78.8K vehicles vs 89.1K YoY. The company has delivered 336,681 cars in the first quarter, far fewer than the 390,000 expected. The decline in Tesla's China deliveries was a bit of a signal that the global sales would be bad, but frankly this wasn't as terrible as I expected. Currently short, will cover if we break $260 to the upside. Also interested in the $250 level. You guys know the risks by now (BYD and competitors, Musk, politics, etc).\n\n[**META**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=META&p=d), [**SNAP**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SNAP&p=d), [**GOOG**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=GOOG&p=d) \\- The April 5th deadline for TikTok to be sold off or face a ban is approaching, potentially leading to incremental headlines today in addition to tariff news. No real move in these stocks yet but I expect any news headline that is negative for TikTok to be great for the companies I'm watching (social media rivals). A ban on TikTok could alter the membership for the social media sites mentioned (they have to go somewhere). Since this is a weekend headline, I'm thinking of buying more GOOG- if TikTok DOES get banned, then these companies will likely gain. Otherwise, business continues as usual and they don't benefit. .",

Despite deep discounts and government stimulus, demand in its Chinese e-commerce business remained weak. \u200bWe've bounced pretty strongly premarket, I'm not actually sure why- as always, be wary that this is Chinese. Interested in seeing what happens at the open. There's a lot of backstory to the narrative of Chinese stocks- we've seen the Chinese government try to inject stimulus into the economy, the US has tried to end the de minimis rule, China's trying to encourage more business (remember the meeting of Xi/business leaders), etc. Overall China is trying to let the private sector operate a little more freely to stave off an economic downturn. PDD owns Temu, which is likely to be a loser of the de minimis rule if it gets ended.\n\n**Related Tickers:** BABA, JD\u200b\n\n[**TSLA (Tesla)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TSLA&p=d)\\- A Financial Times report highlighted a $1.4B discrepancy between Tesla's capital expenditures and asset valuations in the latter half of 2024, raising concerns about potential accounting irregularities. \u200b TSLA is also planning to introduce long-awaited battery innovation in cybertrucks. No real level I'm watching right now, simply seeing how strongly the news affects it. **I actually think this might a nothingburger- difference comes from change in fixed assets in accounts payable and write off of fully depreciated assets.  (amounting to \\~1.2B).** Battery tech (as with all tech) advances pretty quickly, we'll see if there is any meaningful impact on the stock (I'm no battery expert.)\n\n[**VXX**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=VXX&p=d)**/**[**SPY**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SPY&p=d)**/**[**QQQ**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=QQQ&p=d)**/Market stocks -** The Federal Reserve announced a slowdown in quantitative tightening and signaled potential future rate cuts, boosting market sentiment and outlook. Also announced they'd keep future rate cuts. Easing monetary policy often leads to increased liquidity, benefiting equities across sectors.\u200b We've had a bit of a weak bounce since last week's lows, I'm mainly concerned if we can hold prices we at even with a positive catalyst such as this. If we break lows again I'll likely hit out of most of my positions. \n\n**Earnings Today:** [MU](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=MU&p=d), [NKE](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NKE&p=d), [FDX](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=FDX&p=d), [LEN](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=LEN&p=d)",

I am an ex-prop shop equity trader.\n\nThis is a daily watchlist for short-term trading: I might trade all/none of the stocks listed, and even stocks not listed!\n\nI am targeting potentially good candidates for short-term trading; I have no opinion on them as investments.\n\nThe potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting, everything else is secondary.\n\nTariffs are here.\n\nNews: [Trump Tariffs China, Canada, Mexico](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/live-blog/2025-03-04/trump-tariffs-china-canada-mexico)\n\n**Ticker:** [**TSLA (Tesla)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TSLA&p=d)\n\n**Catalyst:** Reports preliminary February China deliveries of 30,688 cars, down close to 50% from last year.\n\n**Technicals:** Overall a brutal delivery report. TSLA has been on a slide since post-election highs and frankly shows no real sign of recovery. Looking for a small bounce in this stock but I don't think there is much potential for long-term recovery.\n\n**Catalyst/Sector Context:** TSLA's EV sales have been declining in China mainly due to BYD, which are considered to make better cars for far cheaper outside the US. The US has a 100% EV tariff for non-US made EV vehicles.\n\n**Risks:** BYD has been eating TSLA's lunch outside of the US. I truly don't see TSLA retaining dominance as the EV of choice outside the US. \n\n**Ticker:** [**OKTA (Okta)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=OKTA&p=d)\n\n**Catalyst:** Okta beat earnings expectations with EPS of $.78 vs $.74,gave guidance that supports EPS of $3.20 vs $2.93. (Also note that CRWD reports today but are not direct competitors)\n\n**Technicals:** Watching $100 level.\n\n**Catalyst/Sector Context:** Cybersecurity (more specifically IAM) grows yearly mainly due to RPO and cRPO (remaining performance obligations). This is subscription backlog expected to be recognized over the next 12 months.\n\n**Risks:** Market saturation/pricing concerns from competitors.\n\n**Ticker:** [**NVDA (Nvidia)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&p=d)\n\n**Catalyst:** Nvidia is front and center as the stock most affected by tariff concerns.\n\n**Technicals:** Watching $110 level. Note that this is the lowest it's been since September 2024. We have millions of shares come in in the first 2 minutes of the open so watch for that.\n\n**Catalyst/Sector Context:** Not much to speak of that hasn't been said before, but NVDA is heavily affected by tariffs and the CHIPS Act, with additional scrutiny that it is somehow bypassing export controls and having their chips go into China.\n\n**Risks:** MORE trade disputes, more potential export restrictions, (Trump has cited he wants to strengthen export controls for NVDA).\n\n**Ticker:** [**BABA (Alibaba)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=BABA&p=d) / [FXI (iShares China Large-Cap ETF)](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=FXI&p=d) / Other Chinese Stocks\n\n**Catalyst:** China has imposed 15% retaliatory tariffs on select U.S. goods.\n\n**Technicals:** $130 level. Most interesting level I'm watching today.\n\n**Catalyst/Sector Context:** Tariffs, stimulus from the Chinese government, China has been spending for increased consumer confidence. \n\n**Risks:** Even greater tariffs, the cash cannon that China is using dies down, less spending by Chinese consumers, etc.\n\n**Related Tickers:** CRM, ZS",

    "title": "Trump says Mexico, Canada tariffs will start March 4, plus additional 10% on China",
    "selftext": ">President Donald Trump on Thursday said that his proposed tariffs on Mexico and Canada will go into effect on March 4, and that China will be charged an additional 10% tariff on the same date.\n\n>The sweeping 25% tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada had been paused on Feb. 3 for one month. But the Trump administration had recently sown confusion about whether they would go back into effect when the delays expired.\n\n>In a\u00a0Truth Social post\u00a0Thursday morning, Trump clarified that they would.\n\n>He claimed that illicit drugs \u201care still pouring into our Country from Mexico and Canada at very high and unacceptable levels,\u201d despite pledges from both U.S. neighbors to boost their efforts to police their borders.\n\n>\u201cWe cannot allow this scourge to continue to harm the USA, and therefore, until it stops, or is seriously limited, the proposed TARIFFS scheduled to go into effect on MARCH FOURTH will, indeed, go into effect, as scheduled,\u201d Trump wrote.\n\n>He also announced that China, which already faces 10% U.S. tariffs on its imports, \u201cwill likewise be charged an additional 10% Tariff on that date.\u201d\n\n>Trump added, \u201cThe April Second Reciprocal Tariff date will remain in full force and effect.\u201d\n\nLink: [https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/27/trump-says-mexico-canada-tariffs-will-start-march-4-plus-additional-10percent-on-china.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/27/trump-says-mexico-canada-tariffs-will-start-march-4-plus-additional-10percent-on-china.html)\n\n**My take:** This news was released at  around 8:51 AM PT. I watched VXX, (VIX ETF),  BABA, FXI, SPY, plus other trade war participants that would be most affected. Interested mainly in triple levered ETFs like UPRO or YINN at the open to see if there's more volatility coming in (which there likely will be). This is somewhat of an incremental headline because we've seen Trump announce tariffs before but we never knew if they were a bluff or not, but today's tweet might be confirmation that this is actually happening (unless yet again, this is a bluff).\n\nThe trade for most of these catalysts is mainly just waiting with your hands on the keyboard and waiting for most of these tweets and being quick on the draw. I traded when Trump was president back in 2016-2020 and read close to every tweet he made.\n\n**I'm most interested in BABA on the news because we're already so over extended from the Chinese government's announcement of liquidity measures yesterday (it was what resulted in the 4% spike yesterday).**",

Interestingly enough, ByBit was (theorized) to be hacked by North Korea.\n\n**Related Tickers:** MARA, RIOT\n\n**Ticker:** [**BABA (Alibaba)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=BABA&p=d)**/**[**FXI (iShares China Large-Cap ETF)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=FXI&p=d)**/Chinese Stocks**\n\n**Catalyst:** China plans to inject at least $55 billion into its largest banks in the coming months as part of a broader stimulus package, Yuan printer go brrrrr. This move is intended to supplement the core Tier 1 capital of China\u2019s six largest state-owned banks. This is the first bank recapitalization since the global financial crisis. 10T yuan (\\~$1.4T) debt package to support local government financing and economic stability.\n\n**Technicals:** We've seen a decent upmove on a lot of Chinese stocks due to this, we'll see how the market reacts.\n\n**Catalyst/Sector Context:** China has been going through a spending crisis, and the government's decision to inject substantial capital into its major banks is a move to strengthen liquidity. This initiative aims to enhance the lending capacity of banks, support local government financing, and stabilize the broader economy. It's a (pre) bailout baby.\n\n**Risks:** This does signal that China sees economic weakness, such as lack of demand due to their real estate sector they've traditionally leaned on for consumer growth/investment. Is this a long term fix? Who knows, but it worked for the US!\n\n**Related Tickers:** JD, BIDU\n\n**Ticker: SMCI**\n\n**Catalyst:** They finally filed an hour before the deadline on the final day! Really cutting it close there lol. The company has faced\u00a0allegations of accounting irregularities. These allegations, along with a failure to file specific financial forms have been a plague for the past year on the stock price. \n\n**Technicals:** We've seen a 20% move AH, so worth watching at open to see if we move further. Other than that, watching $50/$55 level. We'll see where it goes but worth noting that we've made a significant move back to pre-delisting threat prices already.\n\n**Catalyst/Sector Context:** Was at threat of delisting from the NASDAQ but now they're safe baby.\n\n**Risks:** People getting out, or the filing being rejected/advised to resubmit. The latter is a massive catalyst but low probability.\n\nEarnings: NVDA, CRM, SNOW, AI",

Investors are also awaiting earnings from market bellwether Nvidia.\n*****\n> Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 93 points, or 0.2%. Nasdaq-100 futures added 0.7%, while S&P 500 futures climbed 0.4%.\n*****\n> Stocks are coming off a weak session. The S&P 500 tumbled 0.5%, and the Nasdaq Composite lost nearly 1.4%. Both indexes logged their fourth consecutive losing day. The 30-stock Dow was the outlier, with a roughly 0.4% advance.\n*****\n> A weaker-than-expected consumer confidence reading from the Conference Board weighed on stocks Tuesday. A raft of recent reports, including disappointing retail sales numbers and a weak consumer sentiment reading have spurred traders\u2019 worries around the economy over the past week \u2014 and the major averages have suffered.\n*****\n> Nvidia\u2019s fourth-quarter earnings, due after the closing bell Wednesday, could be the next catalyst for the market. The stock climbed 2% in the premarket Wednesday.\n*****\n> The report arrives at a pivotal time for Nvidia. The emergence of DeepSeek raised questions about the sustainability of the once-hot artificial intelligence trade. The chip giant and other momentum plays are also showing signs of fizzling, with Nvidia down more than 5% in 2025.\n*****\n> \u201cI think as the earnings report comes out tomorrow, my expectation is it\u2019s going to be a lot like September,\u201d NYU Stern School of Business finance professor Aswath Damodaran said Tuesday on CNBC\u2019s \u201cClosing Bell.\u201d\n*****\n> \u201cA replay of [the] September [quarter] where they will beat analyst expectations, but the market is going to be disappointed because the market seems to have set expectations higher than what analysts are seeing for the company,\u201d he added.\n*****\n> Economic data due on Wednesday include new home sales and building permits.

(Most of their training is done on NVDA chips)\n\n**Technicals:** Mainly interested to see if we can hold above $130 for NVDA- note that earnings are tomorrow so the short-term performance of the stock hinges on that. Currently long and sold 155C to hedge my position against it.\n\n**Catalyst/Sector Context:** We've seen the CHIPS act actually affect the way that semiconductor companies sell to China- most of those restrictions are bypassed, so this strengthening of export controls might actually affect the industry.\n\n**Risks:** More export controls may lead to China giving tariffs in retaliation- but again, most semis are supply constrained rather than demand constrained so I don't see it as a significant catalyst until more details are released.\n\n**Related Tickers:** [INTC](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=INTC&p=d), [QCOM](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=QCOM&p=d), [ASML](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=ASML&p=d)\n\n**Ticker:** [**BABA**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=BABA&p=d)**,** [**FXI (FTSE China 50 Index)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=FXI&p=d)\n\n**Catalyst:** BABA has introduced its own AI reasoning model within the Qwen framework (like how META has the Llama framework), while we have a surge of all Chinese stock performance following the Chinese government's announcement of liquidity measures.\n\n**Technicals:** It seems as if we've peaked (BABA has gone up close to 50% since the start of this month) for most Chinese stocks in the past few days, I would be interested in being short but I was on vacation this weekend. Interested in shorting BABA specifically if we make another large up move like we did on 2/20.\n\n**Catalyst/Sector Context:** BABA is one of the major competitors that is working on AI models, and is notably using NVDA cards to train its models. \n\n**Risks:** Mainly tariff news and news from other rivals with better models. Straightforward.\n\n**Related Tickers:** [JD](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=JD&p=d), [BIDU](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=BIDU&p=d)\n\n**Ticker:** [**PLTR (Palantir Technologies Inc)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=PLTR&p=d)\n\n**Catalyst:** Previously, PLTR faced concerns due to defense budget cuts and CEO Alex Karp reducing his stake in the company. We've seen it make a massive run from retail and fall just as quickly.\n\n**Technicals:** Interested in playing a small bounce- we're up \\~10% since last earnings report (and pre-crazy move), there is potential for a small bounce here but only entering a small position since it looks like we bottomed early premarket today. \n\n**Catalyst/Sector Context:** Trump directed the government to make significant cuts to the defense budget. (This is a far more significant catalyst than Alex Karp selling shares)\n\n**Risks:** PLTR lives and dies on defense contract money, so obviously further cuts/expansions will affect stock price.\n\n**Related Tickers:** [BA](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=BA&p=d), [GD](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=GD&p=d), [RTX](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=RTX&p=d)\n\n**Ticker:** [**COIN**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=COIN&p=d)**,** [**HOOD**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=HOOD&p=d)**,** [**MSTR**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=MSTR&p=d)\n\n**Catalyst:** The CC market is experiencing heightened volatility due to proposed tariffs and a significant security breach at Bybit, resulting in the loss of approximately $1.5 billion.\n\n**Technicals:** Not too interested in playing this long- still watching to see how we perform but the sell off resulting in the biggest Coin going to $90K has me watching the stock related proxies that deal with the market. \n\n**Catalyst/Sector Context:** CC platforms are highly susceptible to regulatory changes and security incidents.\n\nProposed tariffs affecting digital assets can lead to market vol, while large-scale hacks undermine investor trust and lead to sell-offs in the market as it spreads fear and people wanting to cash out.\n\n**Risks:** Regulatory interventions impose additional compliance costs and operational constraints on CC exchanges.\n\nSecurity breaches not only result in financial losses but also lead to decreased user adoption and revenue.\n\n**Related Tickers:** [MARA](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=MARA&p=d), [RIOT](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=RIOT&p=d)\n\n**Earnings:** [WDAY](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=WDAY&p=d), [INTU](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=INTU&p=d), [CPNG](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=CPNG&p=d)",

Here are your pre-market stock movers & news on this Thursday, February the 20th, 2025-\n\n*****\n\n# [Dow futures drop 100 points as Walmart shares slide after earnings: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/19/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)\n\n*****\n> Stock futures moved lower Thursday, a day after the S&P 500 hit a fresh all-time high, while retail giant Walmart slid after issuing a disappointing outlook.\n*****\n> Futures linked to the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 110 points, or 0.3%. S&P 500 and Nasdaq-100 futures shed 0.2% each.\n*****\n> Dow member Walmart dropped more than 7% after the company said it expects fiscal year sales to grow between 3% and 4%. The company\u2019s fiscal 2026 earnings outlook, meanwhile, was also below analyst expectations. The weak guidance overshadowed fiscal fourth-quarter earnings that topped estimates.\n*****\n> Wall Street is coming off a winning session, with the S&P 500 on Wednesday posting another record high. The Nasdaq Composite and the 30-stock Dow also finished in positive territory as investors shrugged off President Donald Trump\u2019s warning of more tariffs.\n*****\n> \u201cWe have been using the word \u2018resilient,\u2019\u201d Elyse Ausenbaugh, head of investment strategy at JPMorgan Wealth Management said on CNBC\u2019s \u201cClosing Bell\u201d on Wednesday. She added that she expects another high single-digit total return upside from here.\n*****\n> \u201cWe think that 2025 is going to be a year that investors have a chance to build on strength,\u201d Ausenbaugh continued. \u201cWe see more room for this market rally to run.\u201d\n*****\n> Investors also digested newly released minutes from the Federal Reserve\u2019s January meeting. The minutes showed that the central bank\u2019s officials last month agreed that inflation needs to come down more before they cut interest rates again.\n*****\n> Elsewhere on the economic front, investors will be watching for weekly jobless claims data, which is due at 8:30 a.m. ET.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/twI8xkY.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx?t=sec_all)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S S&P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/YBVabTA.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/XKAqGF0.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/a8krR0e.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/x1RWWwu.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/PfZPXYJ.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/oeCrXEb.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/5Vo9U7v.jpeg)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/DJjkUlf.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/9xBVZ4E.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/qNQKREV.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS AFTERNOON'S AFTER-HOURS EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/YDFS1rp.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/KLNPWk7.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/qWMKSQ0.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES!](https://i.imgur.com/fkhAaH0.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/LCJCM7I.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/f6YunOn.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/vAhGdnM.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/20/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-premarket-wmt-has-shak-w-and-more.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n> **Walmart** \u2014 The retailer slid 8% after issuing weaker-than-expected guidance.

    "selftext": "Hey all, TLDR is what the title says. I have a portfolio where I am currently probably taking more risk than I can stomach, and whenever I end up being in a spot where I have put more than 50% of my Net worth in the stock market, this is how I feel. Of course, I know that if I didn't feel that way also 4-5 years ago I would have a lot more money now.  I am also heavily invested in China now. I believe they are set to go on a bull run, but of course maybe they fall 50% again also.\n\nMy investment in China is for two reasons: a) I truly believe they are undervalued and the slow reduction of political risk when Xi starts supporting private businesses will rever them back to their true value, b) a combination of a) with some emotional investing. I lost a lot on China in the past and I want to see it rebound. At the same time I am salty for all the gains I left on the table on PLTR. This is emotional investing. But I can't help it. I also can't stop it yet (i.e. I cannot sell my China exposure until mid March as I added to my position recently and my employer has a rule that doesn't allow me to reverse trade ISINs for 30 days.)\n\nBelow my portfolio percentages, on a 235k portfolio. I'm shitting my pants now because - even though I don't necessarily need this money (at least the amount that is invested) in the next 10 years, I also have trouble dealing with the idea of my hard earned money possibly droppnig by 40-50+% and needing 10 years to rebound. How can I forget this feeling? When I am less than 50% invested, then I always tell myself \"if there is a crash, you have 50% left to DCA and then you can recover faster). \n\nAn idea is to switch to a golden butterfly, which should have lower drops, but I really, really, really, do not like bond ETFs.\n\nFor reference, I live in Europe, in a country where tax for UCITS ETF capital gains is 0%.\n\nI would appreciate any advice on how to shake this feeling off and go all in in some boglehead type portfolio (or Golden butterfly - but I really don't like 40% exposure to bond ETFs). Or any other portfolio. How can I end up investing at least 200k without this feeling. Or any strategies to hedge risk.\n\nTotal Stock Market Index (without Emerging Markets) (IWDA): 25%\n\nTotal Stock Market Index  (VWRL):  10%\n\nS&P 500 Index (VUSA): 10%\n\nBABA: 15%\n\nEmerging Markets Index (EIMI): 4%\n\nChina Large Cap ETF (FXAC): 9%\n\nCash (invested at 2.25% savings rate): 27%\n\nI add 2-2.5k/month on IWDA.",

    "selftext": "This is a daily watchlist for short-term trading: I might trade all/none of the stocks listed, and even stocks not listed!\n\nI am targeting potentially good candidates for short-term trading; I have no opinion on them as investments.\n\nThe potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting, everything else is secondary.\n\nMost interesting news today is the hope that the meeting between Russian/US officials may end the three-year war in Ukraine, in addition to release of the Grok-3 model from xAI (Elon Musk's AI startup.)\n\nNews: [Musk S Xai Debuts Grok 3 Ai Bot Touting Benchmark Superiority](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-18/musk-s-xai-debuts-grok-3-ai-bot-touting-benchmark-superiority)\n\n**Ticker:** [**NVDA (NVIDIA)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&p=d)/[**SMH**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SMH&p=d)/every semis and AI facing stock\n\n**Catalyst:** Elon Musk's AI startup, xAI, has unveiled its latest model, Grok-3, claiming it surpasses competitors like GPT-4o, Google Gemini, DeepSeek V3, and Claude.\n\nThese assertions have not been independently verified by the open sourcen community but it wouldn't be surprising if it could surpass 4o (the model is close to a year old now)\n\n**Technicals:** No real level I've been watching in NVDA, SMH, already positioned long. Note that xAI uses NVDA GPU's specifically in their super computer.\n\n**Catalyst/Sector Context:** We've seen a very strong recovery since the Deepseek fears caused a selloff. Personally I don't think xAI will cause the same effect that Deepseek did, but I think that the semis are a winner of this again.\n\n**Risks:** Unverified performance claims may lead to skepticism among investors and potential customers, impacting adoption rates and market trust. XAI has a \u201cColossus supercomputer,\u201d for training AI, which it said last year was utilizing a cluster of 100,000 advanced Nvidia GPUs for AI training.\n\nToday, the company revealed that it doubled the size of its GPU cluster for the training of Grok 3.\n\n**Related Tickers:** ARM, AMD, INTC\n\n**Offhand Comments:** May see reversal of news if performance doesn't match claims.\n\n**Ticker:** [**HEES (Herc Holdings Inc.)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=HEES&p=d)\n\n**Catalyst:** HEES has confirmed a $105 per share acquisition offer from Herc Rentals, surpassing the previous $92 per share bid from United Rentals.\n\n**Technicals:** Watching $100 level. They've accepted the bid so we might see trading closer to that bid price in the near future.\n\n**Catalyst/Sector Context:** Equipment rental industry is witnessing consolidation due to decelerating growth since 2023 (other than that nothing explosive)\n\n**Risks:** The bidding war may escalate acquisition costs, potentially leading to overvaluation and financial strain for the acquiring company.\n\n**Related Tickers:** URI, HRI\n\n**Ticker:** [**NKE (Nike Inc)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NKE&p=d)\n\n**Catalyst:** Nike has announced a new brand collaboration with SKIMS, launching a line called NikeSKIMS.\n\n**Technicals:** Watching $75 level.\n\n**Catalyst/Sector Context:** SKIMS is pretty popular- mainly does underwear/loungewear/shapewear but this might be more focused on athleisure. This could potentially make a difference in NKE sales- SKIMS also collaborated with The North Face in the past, so worth keeping track of this for future catalysts in case they work with other brands.\n\n**Related Tickers:** LULU, UAA\n\n**Tickers:** [**LMT (Lockheed Martin )**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=LMT&p=d)**/**[**GD (General Dynamics )**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=GD&p=d)**/**[**RTX (Raytheon)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=RTN&p=d)\n\n**Catalyst:** Unconfirmed reports suggest that President Trump plans to demand $500 billion from Ukraine and seek U.S. control over the country's mineral resources.\n\nThese claims have not been reported by major U.S. news outlets but have appeared in international media (from India, Canada, UK)\n\n**Technicals:** This catalyst has been \"semi-leaked\" for the past week but not \"fully confirmed\", but we would likely see a selloff in defense stocks if true.\n\n**Catalyst/Sector Context:** These companies would go to the downside from an end to the Ukraine war, and spike if talks aren't successful.\n\n**Risks:** Pretty much a \"wait for the news announcement\" kind of trade, pretty straightforward.\n\n**Related Tickers:** BA, NOC, HAL\n\n**Ticker:** [**BIDU (Baidu)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=BIDU&p=d)\n\n**Catalyst:** BIDU earnings with an EPS of \u00a519.18 vs \u00a514.13. Revenue of \u00a534.1 billion vs \u00a533.4 billion.\n\nThe company noted a 178% quarter-over-quarter increase in external API calls for its ERNIE AI bot and expects its AI investments to deliver more significant results in 2025.\n\nAdditionally, Apollo Go has commenced 100% fully driverless operations across China since February.\n\n  \n**Catalyst/Sector Context:** The technology sector is rapidly advancing in AI and autonomous driving technologies. Something interesting over the weekend was Xi meeting with private sector business leaders, signaling that China would be more friendly to business leaders (like Jack Ma)  \n  \n**Risks:** It's China.  \n  \n**Related Tickers:** BABA, JD",

This will likely be on China because they are the only country left of the three (Canada/Mexico). He stated he'll give details at 1 PM on Truth Social.\n\n**Risks:** More volatility near that time, going to position accordingly depending on the context of the tweet, but likely will be trading VXX unless something very context specific.\n\n**Ticker:** [**DDOG (Datadog, Inc.)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=DDOG&p=d)\n\n**Catalyst:** Earnings with an EPS of $0.49 vs. $0.43 expected. Revenue of $738M vs. $714.5M expected.\n\n**Technicals:** Not too interested in this unless we break $130 after the open.\n\n**Catalyst/Sector Context:** Cloud security sector is overall growing due to enterprise adoption, but DDOG cited $3.185B vs $3.24B of revenue guidance, slightly lower than expected.\n\n**Risks:** More tariffs, rising/flat interest rates when we expected them to be cut, mostly macro factors when faced with more technology spending.\n\n**Related Tickers:** S, CRWD\n\n**Ticker:** [**BIDU (Baidu, Inc.)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=BIDU&p=d)\n\n**Catalyst:** Baidu announced that its AI chatbot, Ernie Bot, will be available for free starting April 1, citing advancements in technology and reduced costs.\n\n**Technicals:** Had a decent spike premarket, will be watching if this breaks $100 or not.\n\n**Catalyst/Sector Context:** AI is getting cheaper and cheaper; this is a decision similar to DeepSeek to attract users. Will be testing capabilities personally to see how it goes. These competitors are rising to meet OpenAI mainly in price, (can you really get better than free?) and are content with being \"second-best\" as long as customers can save in price and they can save in training costs. Ultimately, I see it as a viable strategy because the average white-collar worker doesn't need the highest performing LLMs.\n\n**Related Tickers:** BABA, JD, AI related stocks\n\n**Ticker:** [**HOOD (Robinhood Markets, Inc.)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=HOOD&p=d)\n\n**Catalyst:** HOOD reported EPS of $1.01 vs 0.44. Revenue reached $1.01B vs $934M.\n\n**Technicals:** Overall a blowout, watching the $65 level.\n\n**Catalyst/Sector Context:** Resurgence in retail trading activity, particularly in cryptocurrencies. Also cited election betting as a major revenue factor. Also announced three major events - new advisory features, crypto events, and the 'HOOD Summit' from the past.\n\n**Risks:** The company's growth is mainly being driven by crypto, which may be curbed by the SEC (but Gensler is gone so I doubt it).\n\n**Related Tickers:** COIN (also has earnings today!)\n\n**Ticker:** [**RDDT (Reddit)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=RDDT&p=d)\n\n**Catalyst:** Reddit reported EPS of $0.36 vs $0.25. Revenue reached $427.7M, vs 408.9M.\n\n**Technicals:** Overall the earnings were good - I have no idea why it fell. Also seems like the market agrees; it's recovered some of the move. The only thing I can find was Reddit's daily active users was 101.7M, slightly below expectations of 103.24M.\n\n**Catalyst/Sector Context:** Reddit cited that their Trends Feature has significant interest from advertisers, but beyond that still not 100% sure as to why the drop.\n\n**Related Tickers:** META, SNAP\n\n**Earnings:** [**COIN**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=COIN&p=d), [**TWLO**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TWLO&p=d), [**DKNG**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=DKNG&p=d), [**AMAT**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AMAT&p=d), [**ABNB**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=ABNB&p=d), [**ROKU**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=ROKU&p=d), [**PANW**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=PANW&p=d)\n\n**IPOs Today:** [**SAIL**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SAIL&p=d)",

I believe that China's growth will reaccelerate. Happy to hear opinions from bears, but I'm very familiar with the VIE structure of some of these stocks and how China is a dictationship etc etc. you won't likely change my mind.\n\nConsider FXI for a diversified China fund that does own shares on the Hong Kong exchange.",

Tariffs on Mexico/Canada are delayed, but we still have tariffs on China, and tariffs have been promised by Trump on the EU.\n\nNews: [As Trump Tariffs Take Effect, China Retaliates With Trade Measures Against U.S.](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/02/04/us/trump-tariffs-news?unlocked_article_code=1.uU4.ps2-.DRzgfM1GnN9i)\n\n**Ticker:** [**PLTR (Palantir Technologies Inc)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=PLTR&p=d)\n\n**Catalyst:** Reported earnings of $0.14 vs. $0.11 expected. Revenue of $828 million vs. $777 million expected. Management highlighted the power of AI and their sizable contracts, citing the nature of the AI war being winner-take-all.\n\n**Technicals:** PLTR absolutely exploded and hit $102 premarket, currently watching $100 level to see if we continue the move. Other than that unlikely to be trading this unless we have massive volume come in.\n\n**Catalyst/Sector Context:** The PLTR ER highlighted the growing demand for AI-driven solutions across government/commercial sectors. Company emphasized securing substantial contracts in the competitive AI landscape, important because they are more closely aligned with the current government.\n\n**Risks:** Obviously being more closely tied to the government means that it has more leeway to be more monopolistic/aggresive in their actions, Alex Karp and Peter Thiel are closely aligned with current government leaders.\n\n**Related Tickers:** MSFT, GOOGL, IBM, AMZN\n\n**Ticker:** [**NVDA (NVIDIA Corporation)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&p=d)\n\n**Catalyst:** Chinese AI company DeepSeek is reportedly preparing to switch to domestic GPUs to circumvent NVDA chip restrictions. DeepSeek has bypassed NVDA CUDA for certain operations, utilizing the PTX (Parallel Thread Execution) language instead. Additionally, on February 2nd, DeepSeek, in collaboration with SiliconFlow and Huawei Cloud, launched DeepSeek-R1/V3 inference services on Huawei's Ascend AI chips. Huawei is also promoting its new Ascend AI processors to Chinese groups considering \"inference\" as an option.\n\n**Technicals:** After the insane move we've seen from $150 to $118, I actually don't consider this to be earth shattering news- China has always been trying to develop their own semis and not using NVDA for training is what they were \"supposed\" to be doing due to the trade restrictions. I'm still long but selling calls against my position, recovery might be slow for NVDA. It's interesting that they are attempting to bypass CUDA, which is essentially the \"standard\" for ML/AI training nowadays on NVDA chips and developing their own.\n\n**Catalyst/Sector Context:** DeepSeek's move to adopt domestic GPUs and bypass CUDA indicates they're aiming for technological self-reliance amidst U.S. export restrictions, rather than trying to adopt more NVDA chips (which presumably isn't a viable long term strategy).\n\n**Risks:** Nvidia faces potential revenue loss if Chinese companies increasingly adopt domestic GPUs and alternative programming frameworks. The effectiveness of U.S. export controls may be undermined as Chinese firms develop workarounds.\n\n**Related Tickers:** AMD, INTC, QCOM, TSM\n\n**Ticker:** [**BABA**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=BABA&p=d)**/(oil stocks, car stocks, etc).**\n\n**Catalyst:** U.S. implemented a 10% tariff on all Chinese imports, aiming to address issues related to drug trafficking, particularly fentanyl. In response, China announced retaliatory tariffs effective February 10, including a 15% tariff on U.S. coal and liquefied natural gas, and a 10% tariff on crude oil, agricultural machinery, and large-engine vehicles.\n\n**Catalyst/Sector Context:** The imposition of these tariffs marks a significant escalation in U.S.-China trade tension and more volatility to come through Trump tweets- we might see a trade war again (sigh) like we did in 2019. Not 100% sure if agricultural machinery will affect stocks like DE but will look into it.\n\n**Related Tickers:** JD, BIDU, TCEHY, PDD\n\n**Offhand Comments:** There are going to be retaliation investigations against companies operating in America, INTC and GOOG have recently been announced as under investigation by China. But it's very important to remember which companies have a presence in China and which don't- for example, GOOG search hasn't worked in China since 2010 lol.\n\n**Ticker:** [**GRAB (Grab Holdings Limited)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=GRAB&p=d)\n\n**Catalyst:** Grab Holdings Ltd. is considering a takeover of its Indonesian rival, GoTo Group, at a valuation of approximately $7 billion.\n\n**Technicals:** Watching $5 level, no bias. I'm not 100% sure if there's an actual \"acquisition\" share price for GoTo but will keep eyes peeled for that acquisition premium.\n\n**Catalyst/Sector Context:** The potential merger represents a significant consolidation in SEA's ride-hailing and food delivery sectors.

Fed funds futures data reflect a nearly 100% certainty that the central bank will keep rates steady at a target range of 4.25% to 4.5%, according to CME Group data.\n*****\n> \u201cWhen it comes to the Fed, they\u2019re widely not expected to do anything tomorrow and that\u2019s a good thing. The less the Fed has to do, the better it is for the market, in our view,\u201d Hickey added.\n*****\n> Investors will be paying especially close attention to Powell\u2019s comments \u2014 his first press conference in President Donald Trump\u2019s second term. The two have had a contentious relationship dating back to Trump\u2019s first term.

    "selftext": "This [Reddit ETF post](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ku6skz/reddit_etf/) was made at the beginning of 2021, near the period of peak euphoria.  Anyone who was around at the time can testify that this really did represent consensus opinions in this sub at that time, which you can see in the comments of that post.  Note that the game store madness did not really begin until a couple weeks later, which is why it did not appear there.\n\nI felt like it was going to play out poorly so I bookmarked it, and now have been doing yearly updates.  After all, for something like this, you really need to give it a multiple year timeline at least.\n\nWe are now on year 4, and to date I have sarcastically remarked about how the sharp, financial geniuses of the time performed against SPY and VTI.  This year I was rather surprised at the results.  All 2025 numbers use the prices right now.\n\n*I used a $100,000 initial investment and just rounded all the prices to the dollar for visual simplicity (all entries use the real, full prices, I have just rounded them for this table).  This also backtracks prices from stock splits.*\n\n|**TICKER**|**Jan8, 2021**|Jan23, 2025|**% change**|**Initial $**|**Final $**|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|TSLA|293|411|\\+40%|5000|7,006|\n|AMD|95|123|\\+29%|5000|6,473|\n|PLTR|25|78|\\+212%|5000|15,592|\n|ICLN|33|11|\\-66%|5000|1,691|\n|NIO|59|4|\\-93%|5000|349|\n|SQ|241|88|\\-64%|5000|1,816|\n|NET|79|123|\\+56%|5000|7,794|\n|DKNG|52|41|\\-21%|5000|3,962|\n|NVDA|13|146|\\+1001%|5000|55,030|\n|AAPL|132|223|\\+69%|5000|8,445|\n|ENPH|207|63|\\-69%|5000|1,533|\n|PLUG|67|2|\\-97%|5000|157|\n|SE|210|116|\\-45%|4000|2,212|\n|BABA|263|86|\\-67%|4000|1,309|\n|CRSP|164|44|\\-73%|4000|1,067|\n|TSM|119|223|\\+88%|4000|7,505|\n|AMZN|159|234|\\+47%|4000|5,880|\n|DIS|179|111|\\-38%|4000|2,475|\n|ABNB|150|133|\\-11%|4000|3,541|\n|FSLY|88|10|\\-88%|3000|349|\n|CRM|222|335|\\+51%|3000|4,526|\n|ARKG|106|27|\\-74%|2000|517|\n|JMIA|37|4|\\-89%|2000|212|\n|JD|92|39|\\-58%|2000|842|\n|**TOTAL**|\\-|\\-|**+40.3%**|**$100,000**|**$140,882**|\n\nGetting carried pretty hard by a few high performers, though to be fair that is sort of the idea of a spaghetti on the wall speculative ETF.\n\nStill, up 40% in 4 years is pretty good!  Let's see how much you beat the market by.\n\n|**Portfolio**|**Initial**|**4/22**|**1/23**|**1/24**|1/25|**% change**|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Reddit ETF|100,000|70,125|56,558|83,579|140,882|\\+40%|\n|SPY|100,000|112,996|105,007|126,536|159,516|\\+60%|\n|VTI|100,000|109,552|100,903|120,221|151,287|\\+51%|\n\nOh.   Though I must admit that I was caught off guard by the comeback it is mounting.  Reddit ETF went up 69% in 2024 and is closing in on VTI.\n\nYou do owe the portfolio manager a couple thousand bucks though.  Assuming you managed to hold onto this in its entirely through multiple years of large underperformance of course.",

    "title": "Pinduoduo (PDD): It Probably Won\u2019t Make You Rich, But It Just Might",
    "selftext": "*The following views and analysis were developed by my friend and me over the past week, during which we've been DCAing into PDD. 49 shares each @ \\~$100*\n\nHello, fellow investors. Long story short, Pinduoduo (PDD) looks like a great investment. And before you start furiously typing CHINA like ----(Rule #5 \u2013 censored)----, hear me out on this one. I\u2019ve broken down my DD into 5 blocks:\n\n1. **The business**\n2. **Competitive Advantages**\n3. **Insider Alignment**\n4. **Risks**\n5. **Valuation**\n\n(TL;DR at the end).\n\nTo give you a taste of the kind behaviour we\u2019re talking about, check out how Chinese e-commerce performed during Trump's last stint.\n\n\\----(Rule #2 \u2013 img censored)----\n\n**1. The business**\n\nPinduoduo is a Chinese e-commerce giant, with low debt and high consolidated earnings, that offers the best deals by grouping individuals to scale orders offering large discounts to buyers. They have a complex business architecture with their main listing and ownership being established in Hong Kong. They are also settled in Ireland (Europe), Singapore and offshore islands.\n\n[PDD corporate mangle](https://ibb.co/xH4HCdY) \n\nIn mainland China, they are very focused on rural areas, where other peers don\u00b4t have a strong presence, offering a wide range of products from fresh produce to electronics. Globally, the company has expanded through its cross-border platform, Temu ([Temu life hack](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnethicalLifeProTips/comments/1g4kqfl/ulpt_find_something_on_temu_but_want_it_the_next/)), targeting value-conscious international shoppers with affordable goods. Temu has been unprofitable in recent years due to significant investments aimed at establishing its presence in the international market. However, this strategy is now on the verge of paying off, as 2024 is projected to be the first year the business turns a profit, which would print huge headlines and a big sentiment shift.\n\nTheir mainland customers are primarily farmers and factory owners, who benefit from the platform by purchasing large quantities of essential products for their businesses. They can then sell their finished goods on Temu, reaching international customers in markets like the U.S. This interconnected ecosystem supports small businesses and fosters customer loyalty by creating a mutually beneficial cycle of trade that reinforces trust and long-term engagement with the Pinduoduo brand.\n\nThey are profitable and have been for many years, with only 46% of revenue coming from mainland China in 2023, down from 60% in 2021, which shows the rapid expansion of their international business.\n\n**2. Competitive advantages**\n\nIn a slowing global economy, with high financial stress on families, affordable products are going to see increased demand, not only in the U.S. but also in Europe. PDD's ability to buy 1st hand from producers in rural (and cheap) areas of China allows them to have a price advantage over all other competitors, and at worst equal them.\n\n[TEMU (Non-PRC) and mainland China (PRC) EBIT during the last years](https://ibb.co/nCb3Yzm) \n\nPinduoduo's focus on rural areas and low-tier cities in China gives it a significant competitive advantage, as these regions are characterized by low competition and minimal pressure on margins. Major players like Alibaba and JD are not heavily focused on these areas, and attempting to penetrate them would likely be unprofitable in the long term due to Pinduoduo's first-mover advantage. The company has already consolidated relationships with many of the small suppliers in these regions, creating a robust and profitable business model with strong cash flows. These cash flows not only sustain operations but also fuel Pinduoduo\u2019s international expansion efforts. Furthermore, this strategy aligns with the Chinese government's emphasis on reducing economic disparity between the wealthier coastal provinces and poorer inland regions. By driving economic activity and wealth creation in underserved areas, Pinduoduo is less likely to face regulatory scrutiny, making its business model both financially and politically resilient.\n\n**3. Investor alignment**\n\nPDD\u2019s founder and ex-CEO, Colin Huang, is the largest single shareholder, holding around 24% of the company. He\u2019s a computer science genius educated in the U.S. and a former Google engineer.\n\nAlthough personal retributions for current board members are opaque, from their statements we can see that their main form of retribution are stock options. They received last year 2.3 million $ cash vs nearly 400 million $ in stock options (at today\u00b4s market price) dating up to 2043, nearly 29 years into the future.\n\n[Compensation table of current board](https://ibb.co/GdDrtSb)\n\nIf 95.5% of my salary was tied to the stock performance, I think we could be sure my interest is aligned with that of a shareholder. Although the opacity of the information might raise suspicious looks, the overall picture shows a correct alignment of their interests with ours.\n\n*\\~1% share dilution is taken into account when calculating the valuation due to this share printing.\\~*\n\n**4. Risks**\n\nLet\u00b4s address the elegant elephant in the room:CHINA\n\n----(Rule #5 \u2013 img censored)----\n\nLet me guess\u2014a totalitarian state ruled by an almighty communist party deciding which companies to meddle with isn\u2019t exactly your idea of a safe investment. Same here. But more importantly, it\u2019s not the preference of Chinese business owners either. That\u2019s why they\u2019ve taken extensive measures to protect their interests. Pinduoduo is listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, has its headquarters in Ireland, and its founder has stepped down from management to reduce political exposure. Their accounts are audited by EY, and their complex ownership structure ensures that different parts of the business operate under separate jurisdictions, adding an extra layer of security.\n\nAll of this sounds great, but let\u2019s be real\u2014if *the party ----(Rule #5 \u2013 censored)----* decides they want Pinduoduo gone, they\u2019re gone. So, the real question we need to ask is: do they, or will they, want them gone? My honest answer is no. As mentioned earlier, Pinduoduo is a key player in China\u2019s agricultural supply chain, particularly in the poorer, rural regions. This matters because the CCP has a history of cracking down on ultra-rich elites flaunting their wealth as part of their push to address inequality and maintain social stability. In contrast, Pinduoduo plays a critical role in supporting these underdeveloped areas by providing affordable goods and access to global markets. A company that drives economic activity and stability in low-income regions is more of an asset than a threat to the government\u2019s goals.\n\nOn top of that, PDD is still a relatively small player in China, holding a solid 14% of the market despite its impressive growth in recent years. This means any concerns about monopoly risks are far off the table. If anything, it\u2019s their bigger competitors - like Alibaba - who are more likely to face anti-monopoly action. Such regulatory pressure on rivals could open up even more opportunities for PDD to expand and solidify its position in its most profitable market.\n\n[Revenue of top chinese e-commerce companies. PDDs revenue increasing it's revenue growth pace while JD and BABA stagnating.](https://ibb.co/0FVCYgw)\n\n**5. Valuation**\n\nBefore getting into the numbers, let\u00b4s explain the 3 base scenarios proposed.\n\n1. **Bear Scenario**: A major political or economic downturn disrupts the business. For instance, tariffs ----(Rule #5 \u2013 censored)----could nullify international expansion/profitability, or the CCP might suddenly decide e-commerce is undesirable. In this case, we assume 0% top-line growth, even though such events would likely only impact around 50% of revenue. This ultra-conservative assumption gives this scenario a 30% probability, though some have claimed it\u2019s been \"100% certain\" for the past decade (and yet here we are).\n2. **Neutral Scenario**: Growth slows, no significant market share is gained, margins compress, and valuation ratios stay at current all-time lows. Under this scenario, growth matches the pace of the Chinese e-commerce market, as predicted by analysts.\n3. **Bullish Scenario**: Growth remains robust, though slightly below recent levels for conservatism. E-commerce in China expands as forecasted, and PDD continues to capture market share from competitors. We assign this scenario a 20% probability.\n\nAs you are all great investors, I won't bore you in excess going through every single number. Here\u2019s a quick summary of the key metrics:\n\n* Bear case: 0% growth, margin EBIT 23%, PER = 9, P/FCF = 7\n* Medium case: 15% growth, margin EBIT 26%, PER = 11, P/FCF = 12\n* Bull case: 20% growth, margin EBIT 30%, PER = 20, P/FCF = 15\n\n*\\~Al ratios are picked from historic PDD data during bull and bear markets\\~*\n\nNow let's get straight into the valuations:\n\n[Valuations](https://ibb.co/9NnK3SJ)\n\nFrom the model, it\u2019s clear we\u2019re looking at a solid deal here: about a **30% margin of safety** and the potential to **double our money in 5 years** (CAGR \\~16%). On top of that, this investment serves as a hedge against any potential U.S. economic crisis.\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**TL;DR:** PDD is a high-growth e-commerce play with strong competitive advantages in Chinese markets and a solid international expansion strategy through Temu. With the lowest political risks among its peers and an undervalued price, it offers a \\~30% margin of safety and the potential to double in 5 years (CAGR \\~16%). ",

I guess the tricky part is that the one I am looking for isn't really categorized as dividends but at the same time it's not growth either. It's a kinda mix of both. I can easily nail down for a stock with 4-5% dividends but doesn't quite meet the other part of requirement consistently. The same is true for vice verse. Any thoughts? If anyone has a suggestion then let me know so that I can dig in and do some research. I would prefer something like the US asset but I am also open to a foreign asset as long as it's not Chinese cause we all know what happened with BABA. In addition, I am not really interested in Chinese assets tbh. Thanks in advance!",

    "title": "Is it Time to Sell DOCN? A Perspective from a Fan",
    "selftext": "# TL;DR\n\nI like DOCN as a company, however I don't think it's a good stock to own for value-minded investors because I realized recently that it does not have clear/profitable competitive advantages and it's own financials do not scream that its a value play compared to stocks that I own (GOOGL, PYPL, unfortunately NET) and the three alternatives (WBD, LULU, HOOD, WEN) that I would want to own. The following is my argument for why this is a stock better suited for mass diversification rather than for stock picking.\n\nNow that I think about it, I should've sold before I posted this. Oh well. Edit: Managed to close @ 42.85 on October 7th (Good till cancel limit order).\n\n# Business Analysis\n\nI have been very partial towards DigitalOcean for the last few years even when it was trading in the $100s. Back then it seemed that many people (myself included since I was naive) did not understand the true value of these tech growth stocks. Only a few years later do we see the true valuations for some of these stocks.\n\nI opened a position in March of this year due to being a DOCN customer myself. However in the last month, I started having doubts on whether DOCN is worth including in a individual stock portfolio of \\~20 \"undervalued\" stocks. At one point, I was down 10%, and now I'm up 11% which is better than my benchmark $MORT which has returned 7% during this time.\n\nThe reason I've changed my mind about DOCN is not actually due to anything they've done incorrectly. It doesn't matter that they are operating financially well, it doesn't matter how nice their products are, it doesn't matter that I personally prefer using DOCN to other platforms, it doesn't matter that they care about small businesses, it doesn't matter how cost effective they are \\[1\\]. The reality is that DOCN competes in an environment with many competitors and substitutes. The barrier to entry is embarrassingly low as we see serverless competitors (substitutes to VPS) like Vercel and Netlify which don't even buy hardware but people do end up spending more on them just because they choose to use JavaScript as a backend and didn't know how much performance a $5/month VPS can provide. These serverless companies rent from AWS, offer their solutions on top, and sublet at a margin. Then there are the very cost effective market (serverhunter) so competing on price alone is how we get perfect competition. Lastly, there are the behemoths of the industry: AWS, Azure, GCS, Shopify (I believe every shopify storefront is hosted on Shopify), Alibaba Cloud, etc. which are more expensive, less intuitive (excluding Shopify, and I don't know if its true for GCS or Baba Cloud), but offer some complex ready to use solutions (e.g. [live streaming](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/implementations/live-streaming-on-aws/) which Kick uses). Given that there are so many competitors that target basically every requirements a business may have (cost, solution, simplicity), I find it hard to use \"competitive advantage\" as justification to own DOCN unlike owning GOOGL. So that really leaves the question whether DOCN is currently undervalued on its own merits:\n\n# Financial Merit Compared to My Alternative Holds and Buys\n\nP/E is over 60, Beta over 1.5, QoQ growth has been 2-4% last 3 quarters. FCF market cap yield is 3% compared to:\n\n* 0.64% at Cloudflare which has a competitive advantage, however not actually worth owning for value investors\n* 3% at Google (which is a mature & profitable company)\n* 8.26% at PYPL (which has less competition in the payments space, is profitable, and has been around longer)\n* Even LULU has 5% FCF yield and the short-term bull case for that is China.\n* WBD with 33% FCF yield; this is the stock I will be buying with the proceeds\n* HOOD: had a high FCF yield in March\n\n\\[1\\]: I will admit that I pay a dollar extra per month on Heroku plus the certificate cost just because I used to host my website on Heroku which dropped the free tier after salesforce acquired the.",

That's a 34.3 price/FCF ratio.\n\nI know it's a chinese stock and they should be \"discounted\" because of American's perceived risk but this seems a bit excessive of a discount. Even when it was trading at ATH's it had a price/FCF of 4.5 which to me still seems like a screaming buy. Given the recent china stimulus and runup of baba, I think it should still be a buy right as chinese consumers get this stimulus and baba should benefit? Am I wrong here? Are there risks I'm ignoring?",

The Dow closed Wednesday lower in the immediate aftermath of the Fed\u2019s announcement.

Nvidia and AMD shares popped more than 3% each. Micron Technology traded more than 2% higher. Other big tech stocks such as Meta and Alphabet climbed more than 2% higher.\n*****\n> Stocks leveraged to lower rates spurring the economy also jumped Thursday morning.

Here are your pre-market stock movers & news on this Tuesday, September the 10th, 2024-\n\n*****\n\n# [Stock futures are flat as September sluggishness continues, traders await inflation data: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/09/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)\n\n*****\n> Stock futures were mostly flat Tuesday after the major averages rebounded from their worst week in 2024.\n*****\n> Futures tied to the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures each added about 0.1%. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures dipped 16 points, or less than 0.1%.\n*****\n> Cloud platform company Oracle surged about 8% after posting fiscal first-quarter results that topped expectations. Oracle also announced a partnership with Amazon Web Services to provide database services.\n*****\n> On Monday, the three major averages made a sharp comeback after posting their worst week this year as investors bought the dip. The S&P 500 popped 1.16% to snap a four-day run of losses and post its first winning day in September. The Nasdaq Composite also closed 1.16% higher, aided by a jump in Nvidia. The Dow climbed 484 points, or 1.2%.\n*****\n> These moves come as investors bet that a widely anticipated interest rate cut at the Federal Reserve\u2019s Sept. 17-18 meeting could help assuage concerns over a weakening economy. August\u2019s payrolls report, which came out last Friday, reflected growth of 142,000, below economists\u2019 expectations. The results helped fuel a sell-off that day.\n*****\n> Traders have their eyes on two key economic reports that will likely be the next catalysts for stocks. The consumer price index report for August is due out Wednesday, followed by the producer price index on Thursday.\n*****\n> September is historically a weak month for equities. Investors remain cautious about seasonality\u2019s effect on stock performance as well as uncertainty around the approaching U.S. presidential election on Nov. 5.\n*****\n> \u201cWe concur with the view that the market is likely to remain choppy at least until the election,\u201d Bank of America equity and quantitative strategist Ohsung Kwon wrote Monday. \u201cMacro data have been weakening, especially in manufacturing/goods, which represent 50% of earnings for the S&P 500.\u201d\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/F1u1rz2.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx?t=sec_all)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S S&P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/2pSqvuD.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/gb5lDvj.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/1ppt8qf.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/fvDuGmO.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/ooHLPXO.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/W2znR9n.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/RZnhV43.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS AFTERNOON'S AFTER-HOURS EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/G5I22c3.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/wWqoQVY.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/BY9f6uy.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/cGpzMU1.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!]()**)\n(N/A.)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/5yZTumP.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/nSGigct.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/10/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-premarket-aapl-orcl-boot-avo.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n> **Mission Produce** \u2014 The avocado producer surged 21.6% after reporting revenue for the fiscal third quarter jumped 24% from a year ago.

    "selftext": "Hello I am here to talk about one of the stocks that I like. After doing some research I have decided to start building a position on it. I am going to list out the reasons I like the stock and the risks I see for JD.\n\n**Let's start with the big macroeconomics**\n\nWe all know China\u2019s economy is pretty bad right now. There\u2019s a reason a lot of Chinese stocks have been beaten down. Also the geopolitical tensions does not help. However I do see China making a recovery over the coming years. This is a pretty safe bet IMO.\n\n[https://institutional.fidelity.com/app/item/RD\\_13569\\_40890/business-cycle-update.html?pos=T](https://institutional.fidelity.com/app/item/RD_13569_40890/business-cycle-update.html?pos=T)\n\nIf you check the link you can see China is ahead of everyone in the business cycle. Most of the world has yet to experience a real contraction. This brings me to another point: Investors will start to chase yield when the US starts their contraction phase. China looks to be the only market that will be out of their contraction phase at that point.\n\n**Michael Burry**\n\n[https://stockcircle.com/portfolio/michael-burry](https://stockcircle.com/portfolio/michael-burry)\n\nI know say what you want about him miss predicting the last x amount of recessions but at the end of the day he has good returns and has a history of picking up on value stocks. His current 2 top holdings are BABA and JD. Looking at his portfolio was what tipped me off to look into them. You also have the opportunity to get in at a lower price than Michael Burry.\n\nPros\n\n* The average forecast for JD in 12 months is $40.58\n\n* EBITDA Margin has a lot of room to grow 2.27% compared to BABA (19.47%)\n* Predicted to grow until 2027\n* Generate a lot of revenue compared to their market cap of 42B\n\n* $0.74 Dividend\n\nRisks\n\n* Low EBITDA Margin (because if it slips then they can easily become unprofitable)\n* Geopolitical tensions\n* Charts are pretty bearish (stock has gone almost nowhere past few years)\n* Betting on China\n* Question that came across my mind was \u201cWHERE IS ALL THEIR MONEY GOING?\u201d\n\n**My Plan**\n\nI am going to start building a position on JD. I have pretty bad timing so I will be buying in set increments while keeping an eye on their earnings. I will look for leaps given the right price. I also like BABA but I believe JD has high potential for return.\u00a0This is a higher risk reward play.\n\nWhether you agree with me or not good luck on your investing journey!",

    "selftext": "In their latest report, Alibaba announced that they repurchased another $5.8B worth of shares in Q2. Over a period of 3 years,\u00a0$BABA\u00a0has been able to reduce its shares outstanding by close to 14%.\n\nThere are a **few points** to consider when investing in Alibaba:\n\n* Despite revenue growth slowing, Alibaba remains a cash flow machine with strong fundamentals and is trading close to all-time lows in multiple metrics.\n* Alibaba's focus on share buybacks, dividend issuance, and expansion into AI and cloud computing make it a strong long-term investment with the potential for significant returns.\n* Alibaba provides a large margin of safety for long-term investors looking for exposure in China.\n* They have plenty of cash to spend as they have a load of money on their balance sheet. They are using this to buy back even more shares or to issue a special dividend like they did recently.\n\nI believe Alibaba is suffering significantly from the sentiment that is completely in the gutter regarding China. As such, Chinese equities with Alibaba being one of my personal favorites, are currently giving investors an enticing value proposition with a relatively high margin of safety.\n\nWhile the thesis might take a while to play out, an improvement in sentiment could quickly launch the stock price higher.\n\nWhat do you personally think of Alibaba?\u00a0\n\nFull disclosure: I'm currently net long on Alibaba through a multitude of options, but my position might evolve rapidly. Nevertheless, I don't think $100+ relatively soon is out of the question.",

They're all sitting at 5%-65% losses over multiple years. Meanwhile the two ETFs I'm in have absolutely rocketed over that time-period (QQQ and VOO). It's so frustrating because if I'd have just gone 100% into the ETFs, I would have made so much more money. Obviously that's why ETFs exist and picking stocks is left to professionals..\n\nStill, now, I don't know whether to just sell the above stocks at a loss and go into the ETFs or if that's just me being rash. Each of them are strong companies, for example BABA is underpriced although I know that's because of politics in China, and even the 'overpriced' ones have their arguments of possibly going up more than the ETFs in the future for various reasons (GTA VI is going to be absolutely huge for TTWO, I don't think it's fully priced in yet, and TSLA speculation) but also I don't want to just lose a bunch of money again.

    "selftext": "Alibaba missed market expectations for revenue in the December quarter, but announced it is increasing the size of its share buyback program by $25 billion, sending shares to whipsaw after earnings were released.\n\nU.S.-listed shares in the Chinese e-commerce giant were are one point more than 5% higher in pre-market trade, but turned slightly negative after.\n\nAlibaba said the $25 billion increase is added to its share repurchase program through the end of March 2027, bringing the total available under the scheme to $35.3 billion.\n\nThe announcement comes as Alibaba released financial results for its December quarter.\n\nHere\u2019s how Alibaba did in its fiscal third quarter, compared to LSEG estimates:\n\nRevenue: 260.35 billion Chinese yuan ($36.6 billion) versus 262.07 billion yuan expected.\n\nRevenue missed expectations, growing just 5% year-over-year, logging a slowdown from the previous quarters as growth in the company\u2019s China e-commerce business and cloud computing division remained slow.\n\nAlibaba has been grappling with a difficult macroeconomic environment in China, where the consumer has remained weak, even after Beijing removed its Covid-era restrictions. Amid economic uncertainties, local shoppers have flocked to discounting platforms such as Alibaba rival Pinduoduo.\n\nThe Taobao and Tmall business, Alibaba\u2019s China e-commerce platforms, brought in revenue of 129.1 billion Chinese yuan in the December quarter, up just 2% year-on-year.\n\nAlibaba\u2019s cloud computing business, which investors have seen as critical to the tech giant\u2019s future growth, brought in sales of 28.1 billion yuan, a 3% year-on-year rise.\n\nIn a statement, recently-appointed Alibaba CEO Eddie Wu said the company\u2019s focus is on growth in e-commerce and cloud.\n\n\u201cOur top priority is to reignite the growth of our core businesses, e-commerce and cloud computing. We will step up investment to improve users\u2019 core experiences to drive growth in Taobao and Tmall Group and strengthen market leadership in the coming year.\u201d\n\nAlibaba had a tumultuous year in 2023, when it carried out its largest-ever corporate structure overhaul. It also separately implemented several high-profile management changes, with company veteran Eddie Wu taking over the reins as chief executive in September.\n\nDaniel Zhang, the previous CEO of Alibaba Group who became acting head of the cloud business in December 2022, was supposed to stay on to lead the business unit, but unexpectedly quit in September last year.\n\nOn top of its structural changes, Alibaba also scrapped the hotly-anticipated spinoff of its cloud computing business last year.\n\nMore recently, two of Alibaba\u2019s co-founders, Jack Ma and Joe Tsai, in January bought shares worth around $200 million in the Chinese e-commerce giant.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/07/alibaba-baba-q3-2023-earnings-report-for-december-quarter.html",

First, is my overall income going to really be any different next year then this year? If it's likely to be basically the same income, then the tax rate will end up being basically the same, so why not take the hit right now and get it over with? \n\nThe second reason, is that if everybody else is thinking like me, and they're waiting for the first week of January to take profits, then wouldn't selling a few days before then be better? Won't all the most frothy stocks get a bit cheaper in the first week of January if a lot of people are doing this?\n\nAlso, by the same token, you have the tax loss harvesting that happens in the last couple of days of December. This is usually stocks that are **still** badly beaten down. Because if they had rallied so much, then they wouldn't be \"losses\". So, think of stuff like PayPal and BABA. Stuff that still hasn't recovered enough.\n\nAnyways, just curious about everybodies thoughts in relation to tax-loss harvesting, selling in early January... and all that other jazz.",

    "selftext": "(Reuters) -U.S.-listed shares of Alibaba Group Holding (BABA) declined on Friday following a Morgan Stanley downgrade on concerns over slower turnaround in its key businesses, hours after PDD raced past its rival to become the most valuable Chinese e-commerce firm.\n\nAlibaba's (BABA) stock slipped 3.2% to $72.5, touching a fresh one-year low. The shares are down nearly 17% since the company last month posted in line second-quarter revenue and scrapped plans to spin off its cloud business.\n\nMeanwhile, shares of PDD Holdings (PDD) have surged this week following stellar quarterly results from the Temu parent. The company closed with a market capitalization of nearly $196 billion on Thursday, surpassing Alibaba's (BABA) market value of $190.45 billion.\n\nMorgan Stanley analysts downgraded Alibaba (BABA) to \"equal-weight\" from \"overweight\", flagging concerns over softness in its customer management revenue and cloud business due to sagging economic recovery in China.\n\nThey also noted uncertainties from Alibaba's (BABA) decision to scrap the spin-off of its cloud business.\n\nMorgan Stanley cut its price target on the stock to $90 from $110, the second lowest among analysts, as per LSEG data. The downgrade is the third in as many weeks by Wall Street brokerages.\n\nAlibaba's (BABA) U.S. shares, down about 18% so far this year, are set for their third consecutive year of losses.\n\nOn the other hand, Morgan Stanley named PDD as its top pick in the sector, saying the company is best placed to navigate the current economic environment with its heavy discounting steps.\n\n\"We expect PDD to continue to gain share in the domestic market thanks to its favorable business model amid consumers' behavior shift,\" Morgan Stanley's Eddy Wang noted, adding that its cross-border e-commerce business, Temu, is not fully valued by the market.\n\nPDD shares were down 2.1% at $144.4 but have surged almost 80% in 2023, handily outperforming its peers.\n\nAt 21.4, PDD has the highest forward price-to-earnings ratio among rivals including JD.com (JD) and Vipshop Holdings.

The jumbled spinoff plan isn't helping as well.\n\nBUT, the company has a ~$15BN usd FCF without adding back stock based comp, has been buying back $10BN a year which with today drop would be about 5% of shares outstanding a year, and has been growing ok. Plus EV is only $160BN, so fcf yield (w/o SBC) is 10%, pretty solid all things considered.\n\nI'm curious what people think would need to happen for multiple re-expansion to occur here, or is the expectation that the multiple will rest where it is and any gains will have to come through a mix of long-term share repurchases and the new dividend distribution they announced?",

To treat it like night and day - it occurs sometimes and you just get through it. Meanwhile you should wait for a big opportunity. And when that opportunity comes - you pounce it hard. \n\nI don't know about you, but to me this sounds exactly like timing the market. You essentially are waiting(not acting, so timing) for something negative to happen to a company or the economy as a whole and the price/prices to get crushed to such a ridiculous level that you have a what Munger calls \"rare opportunity\"(or essentially timing for such). \n\nFor the daily journal portfolio he manages he has bought like 5 stocks in 15 years. 4 of them are banks he purchased as banks collapsed in 08-09. 1 is \"recent\" - BABA after it had went down 50-60% and kept on adding as it was down 70%. \n\nHow does this not equal to timing the market?",

After I have gained my 20% I turn on trailing stop loss and set it to a conservative 6%. In the case of stocks like Wayfair (2020) this made me a fortune ($12k in under 8 months). \n\nWhy should someone not do this right now with the mid, large, mega caps of China like JD which is down significantly? BABA is another example but not as down as far as many others. Would it be a bad idea in your opinion to invest in an ETF like FLCH right now? \n\nJust an FYI I feel like there is not going to be a recession in the USA and that we are instead going to see stagflation and very bad lag for the next 18 months until things go back to \"normal\" (6% to 8% gains in broader market ETFs like the good ole days). Some of my closest friends say to not touch Chinese stocks, due to the regulations and the way China runs, with a 10 foot pole.

    "title": "Is Alibaba stock ($BABA) a buy now?",
    "selftext": " \n\n* **Alibaba still owns some of the best businesses in China.**\n* **But Alibaba's investors must endure a few major risks.**\n* **Alibaba stock is relatively cheap.** \n\n## Alibaba might have own great businesses, but investors should not ignore the downsides of holding the stock.\n\n**Alibaba's** **($****BABA****)** stock has been volatile. It peaked at $317 per share, fell to a low of $58 a few months ago, and recovered to $120 early this year.\n\nBut as of this writing, the stock has fallen back to around $90. The bulls might be excited with the opportunity to buy this high-quality company on the cheap. But before jumping into the stock, let's go through both sides of the coin of investing in Alibaba. \n\n## The Bull case\n\nForeign investors were shocked (and perplexed) when the Chinese government decided to crack down on its national champion Alibaba and its various subsidiaries like Ant Group in the last few years.\n\nWhile no investors enjoy seeing their company face a government crackdown, the event signaled to me an important fact -- that Alibaba owns some of the most dominant franchises in China.\n\nTake e-commerce, for example. Alibaba served around 900 million customers in the fiscal year 2022 (ended March 31, 2022 ). That year, it enabled about 8 trillion yuan (more than a trillion dollars) worth of transactions on its Taobao and Tmall platforms. In that year, Amazon achieved around $600\u00a0 billion. \n\nAlibaba's success in the retail industry sparks further expansion in related sectors like logistics, cloud computing, fintech, and others. For example, Alibaba Cloud is the most significant player in China, with around 37% market\u00a0 share in 2021. Alibaba's fintech associate, Ant Group, powered over half of China's payment\u00a0 industry while leading in other areas like lending and asset management.\n\nAlibaba also owns some younger (but with great potential) ventures like Cainiao Logistics, overseas e-commerce, and local consumer services. These businesses could grow into further giants as they operate in large and growing markets.\n\nIt is also important to note that Alibaba has a solid balance sheet ($61 billion in cash net of borrowings ) and strong cash-flow-generation capabilities -- it generated $20 billion in free cash flow in the first nine months of the fiscal year 2023. With these firepowers, the tech giant can afford to invest heavily in sustaining and growing its leadership in various businesses.\u00a0\n\nSince its IPO in 2014, Alibaba has been growing revenue at a rapid rate of more than 30% (even 50% in some years).\u00a0 While its recent growth has been disappointing (more on this in the next section), the company has the necessary ingredients -- solid businesses and plentiful resources -- to keep growing at respected rates for years to come. \n\n## The bear case\n\nAlibaba might own a few good businesses, but there are still risks that investors cannot ignore.\n\nOn one level, investors must face the inherent risks of investing in Chinese companies amid the significant differences in market dynamics, culture, and regulatory regimes. Investors must understand these areas well to make sound investment decisions.\n\nOn top of that, the biggest hurdle for investing in China comes from the political risks. The crackdown on technology companies -- including Alibaba and Tencent -- that has been ongoing over the last two years is an excellent example of what the Chinese government could (and would) do to keep the country under its tight grip.\n\nOn its own, Alibaba is also facing numerous challenges. Topping the list is the slowdown in growth in the last few quarters. For perspective, revenue grew 41% in fiscal 2021, 19% in fiscal 2022, and just 2% in the first nine months of the fiscal year 2023. Alibaba's already gigantic size, competition from Pinduoduo and Douying, and COVID-19 lockdowns impacted the company's recent performance. \n\nOn the one hand, the bulls might argue that growth would again pick up over the longer term, given the above-mentioned opportunities. Yet, the bears might be concerned that Alibaba might have passed its prime and that it's unlikely to return to its old days of hypergrowth mode.\n\n## So is Alibaba stock a buy?\n\nThe bulls and the bears have good reasons to hold onto their stances.\n\nFor investors willing to tolerate some volatility, it makes sense to buy Alibaba stock today. It owns some of the best businesses in China, and the stock is cheap -- it has a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 1.7 compared to its five-year average of 6.5.\n\nBut for those uncomfortable with the associated China-specific risks or unwilling to tolerate the company-specific challenges described above, it's best to avoid the stock.",

Is Chinese Communist Part to blame for Alibaba dropping from 150 billion Yuan earnings in 2021 to 52 billion a year later? \n\nNiu managed to somehow achieve 50 million net loss in 2022 compared to 225 million profits in 2021. \n\nOne could blame it on Covid, but they haven't been much impacted in 2020, as we can see on the financial statements. \n\nI know I am generalizing here a lot, but the same thing happened with other Chinese stocks like Douyu and Tencent (TME).\n\nI feel like those companies are not just undervalued, but actually at probably close to their fair price considering the horrible performance and political risks. I mean I purchased BABA at average price of 216$ when people were giving it a price prediction of 300-350$ in **just a year.** My average price for NIU is 15$ and it was rapidly growing back then. Now both are quite cheaper and still can't say they are undervalued. \n\nWhy the Chinese government decided to scare away investors and ruin those good companies at least for couple of years? Aren't they overall losing a lot by all these crackdowns? Why they hate the free market so much? \n\nWhat do you expect to happen in the next 2-5 years with those companies?",

The major indexes were also pressured by steep declines in Apple and Tesla shares.\n*****\n> \u201cU.S. stocks were unable to hold onto earlier gains as restrictive policy and recession fears remained front and center for investors,\u201d wrote Oanda\u2019s senior market analyst Ed Moya in a note to clients Tuesday. \u201cDiscount buying triggered another bear market rebound that didn\u2019t last long at all.\u201d\n*****\n> Investors will gain more insight into what Fed members are thinking on Wednesday afternoon as minutes from the central bank\u2019s latest policy meeting are released.

If the Judge in the options case rules Musk unduly influenced the board to grant him that $55 Billion Tesla options package by being a controlling shareholder and forces him to give up that $55 Billion in Tesla shares while simultaneously Tesla falls below $120 ( which it is dangerously close to) will Musk effectively bankrupt himself?

Here are your pre-market stock movers & news on this Wednesday, November the 16th, 2022-\n\n*****\n\n# [Stock futures slip as investors await October retail sales data](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/15/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)\n\n*****\n> Stock futures dipped Wednesday as investors weighed another lighter-than-expected inflation report and looked ahead to retail sales data.\n*****\n> Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average traded marginally lower. S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures also fell slightly.\n*****\n> Those moves came after Target reported much weaker-than-expected earnings for the third quarter. The results weighed on futures and sent the stock down more than 13%. Target also warned of a weak holiday quarter.\n*****\n> Wall Street is coming off a positive session, with the S&P 500 closing up 0.87% on Tuesday and the Dow adding 56.22 points, or 0.17%. The Nasdaq jumped 1.45% and is the only major average on pace to eke out slight gains for the week. The producer price index report, which measures wholesale prices, came in below expectations, which alleviated some of investors\u2019 concerns around inflation.\n*****\n> Chinese technology stocks were among the best performers Tuesday, with the KraneShares CSI China Internet ETF gaining 9.56% for its best daily performance since March 16. Nine out of 11 S&P 500 sectors rose, led to the upside by communication services and information technology. Both health care and materials posted slight losses.\n*****\n> Stocks have staged a solid run following last week\u2019s better-than-feared consumer price index report. The S&P 500 last week posted its best weekly stretch since June and all the major averages are on track to finish the month with gains.\n*****\n> Some investors say a near-term retreat is on the horizon, however.\n*****\n> \u201cIn the short term, the market is very extended and overdue to pull back and digest the recent rally,\u201d said Adam Sarhan, CEO of 50 Park Investments.\n*****\n> Retail sales due out Wednesday could offer another look at consumer behavior amid inflation.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/Z9wfANT.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S S&P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/bsC5v2q.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/ruLVGhs.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/xdQSFf6.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/wWvDzpe.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/5w96vdA.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/Ov2p2np.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/3Z13MhP.jpg)**)\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/kIer12C.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/MnWIPz0.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/tE2tOeQ.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/YkCMcWZ.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/4rxtNuS.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/lbV4pV6.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/S79UtoY.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/WlRhodG.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/16/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-premarket-target-lowes-carnival-and-others.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n> **Target (TGT)** \u2013 Target plunged 13.5% in the premarket after missing consensus estimates by 59 cents with quarterly earnings of $1.54 per share.

Take the results inferred from the prophecies, select the sectors that match, buy the ones that are undervalued, wait, and then sell when the time is right.\n\nI personally invested heavily in Lithium Americas for its role in clean energy and waited a long time.\n\nRecently, I was fortunate that Lithium Americas surged, and I made a good profit.\n\nYou can also find Baba Vanga\u2019s prophecies on Wikipedia for reference.\n\nIf you are not sure, focus on renewable energy, AI, quantum computing, or biotechnology.\n\nIf you wait a few years, the chances are high that you will not lose money.",

    "selftext": "I am a relatively new investor. I did some investing in 2014 for a year then pulled out of the market because I was still young and didn't have enough assets at the time. I have been back in the market for the last three years. Thankfully I have consistently beaten the market by a good margin but my main worry right now is that I have held a significant proportion of Chinese stocks - mainly because some good companies could be had at bargain prices. I am worried now that I misjudged and that the probability of war is rising to an uncomfortable level ( I don't think it's likely but Im realizing that even the possibility may be too much risk when you factor it into the valuation). My main Chinese holdings are Byd ( largest position by far), Bidu, Baba, and a small recent position in Xpev). What would happen if war starts? Is it time to sell those stocks? I've mostly held these stocks for more than a year.  I would say my risk tolerance is relatively high because I'm young with good income and no kids, but I can't justify holding on to them if there is a real possibility it goes to zero value\n \nHaving to pay tax before further compounding of those assets is a big negative, especially since I do like some of the companies still - but I am quite worried about the possibility that my hard earned savings will plummet to absolute zero overnight if a major war starts with the west. Is it time to take the painful and bold decision to sell everything Chinese? What about TSMC? Would you treat that the same given the vulnerability there? \n\nI suspect there will be different opinions. I am leaning in a direction but hoping for opinions and justifications from some experienced people so I can feel more assured before doing a big move.",

If we can sustain above it, we could see a significant continuation to the upside. \n\nLet's acknowledge the **60% punitive tariffs:** While tariffs are certainly a concern, there's also a lot of optimism about $BABA\u2019s growth potential, especially as sentiment shifts in favor of China-related stocks.\n\nALSO, $BABA has overtaken SOFI in trending stocks today, which reflects a shift in market focus. It is clear investors are positioning themselves for what's next.\n\n**Position Update:**  \nI\u2019ve entered with 85 $90 calls, expiring tomorrow, as well as monthly calls for February and July. My strategy here is to ride this momentum in case we see another explosive move like the last breakout. If we get a repeat of that momentum, it could result in a major opportunity for significant gains.\n\n**For this to play out i am looking at:**\n\n$SPY: Broader market trends will definitely play a role. Watch how the broader indices react to this shift in sentiment.\n\n$JD and $WIMI: Both are key players in the same space and could offer insights into the market\u2019s direction for Chinese tech stocks.  \nAs we look at geopolitical catalysts, China\u2019s relationship with the U.S. continues to **impact stock behavior in these sectors.**\n\nI've started to build long positions here.

    "selftext": "Hello I am here to talk about one of the stocks that I like. After doing some research I have decided to start building a position on it. I am going to list out the reasons I like the stock and the risks I see for JD.\n\n**Let's start with the big macroeconomics**\n\nWe all know China\u2019s economy is pretty bad right now. There\u2019s a reason a lot of Chinese stocks have been beaten down. Also the geopolitical tensions does not help. However I do see China making a recovery over the coming years. This is a pretty safe bet IMO.\n\n[https://institutional.fidelity.com/app/item/RD\\_13569\\_40890/business-cycle-update.html?pos=T](https://institutional.fidelity.com/app/item/RD_13569_40890/business-cycle-update.html?pos=T)\n\nChina is ahead of everyone in the business cycle. Most of the world has yet to experience a real contraction. This brings me to another point: Investors will start to chase yield when the US starts their contraction phase. China looks to be the only market that will be out of their contraction phase at that point.\n\n**Michael Burry**\n\n[https://stockcircle.com/portfolio/michael-burry](https://stockcircle.com/portfolio/michael-burry)\n\nI know say what you want about him miss predicting the last x amount of recessions but at the end of the day he has good returns and has a history of picking up on value stocks. His current 2 top holdings are BABA and JD. Looking at his portfolio was what tipped me off to look into them. You also have the opportunity to get in at a lower price than Michael Burry.\n\nPros\n\n* The average forecast for JD in 12 months is $40.58\n\n[https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/jd/forecast](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/jd/forecast)\n\n* EBITDA Margin has a lot of room to grow 2.27% compared to BABA (19.47%)\n* Predicted to grow until 2027\n* Generate a lot of revenue compared to their market cap of 42B\n\n[https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/jd/earnings](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/jd/earnings)\n\n* $0.74 Dividend\n\nRisks\n\n* Low EBITDA Margin (because if it slips then they can easily become unprofitable)\n* Geopolitical tensions\n* Charts are pretty bearish (stock has gone almost nowhere past few years)\n* Betting on China\n* Question that came across my mind was \u201cWHERE IS ALL THEIR MONEY GOING?\u201d\n\n**My Plan**\n\nI am going to start building a position on JD. I have pretty bad timing so I will be buying in set increments while keeping an eye on their earnings. I will look for leaps given the right price. I am not going to throw my entire portfolio into. I also like BABA but I believe JD has high potential for return.\u00a0\n\nGood luck on your investing journey brothers!",

It was a stable value play.. The drawdown in stock market 20% in 2022 was way more scary than the house\u2019s 1% draw down.\n\nand 1 more, the house will be more and more attractive if it\u2019s holding period is longer and longer thanks to prop 13..\n\nso, my conclusion is, honestly, a california metro area entry house isn\u2019t too much behind the sp 500, but it\u2019s a higher maintenance investment. it\u2019s almost 0 downside volatility.\n\nA true story.",

I don't pay for these sites -- I only see what's available for free.  I want to see how other people look at these sites and others to generate ideas.  There is also Tipranks and Gurufocus but I find Dataroma and Whalewisdom to be more convenient to look at.\n\nFrom Dataroma, I follow Buffett, Michael Burry, David Tepper, Howard Marks, Bill Miller, and Leon Cooperman.  There are more investors and firms available but I find these guys to be really the bottom-up guys into old-fashioned stock-picking.  Burry for many small-cap picks.  Tepper for his guesses on which sector may rise and his energy picks.  It almost seems like Tepper and Burry coordinated last quarter when they went full hog and bought huge stakes in Ali Baba, [JD.com](http://JD.com) and Baidu.  I follow Marks particularly for his international picks and resource plays:  he recently bought stakes in Brazilian companies, Vale and Petrobrasil.\n\nFrom Whale Wisdom, you can follow specific hedge funds like Elliott Management through their 13F and 13D filings.  Very interesting that Elliott bought a huge stake recently in Suncor, the Canadian oil sands company (12% of its holding) -- the vast majority of its holding (10%) was purchased last quarter.  This gives me some ideas to explore: why would Suncor be favored by Elliott when it's near a 5-year high right now?\n\nYou can also follow hedge funds like Paul Tudor's Tudor Investment and Ken Griffin's Citadel through Whale Wisdom.  Many of these positions have call and put options: you can see what they are thinking about particular sectors: many of them are options on S&P sector indices.\n\nSo who do you follow and whose picks do you find to be most useful to get the drift of the market?  Any of you paying members?  If so, which of these sites' offer features that are worth paying for?  Inquiring investing minds wanna know!",

China, with the bad press from the US major media and subsequently Markets realigning with US policy (decoupling) left the stock market in the lows. You have companies like $BABA that IPOed at $68 per share on Sept. 14, 2014, and last week this thing was touching that price. But let's compare BABA business and valuation quickly:  \n\n\n|In Millions|2014|2023|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Revenues|52,504 RMB or $8,463|868,687 RMB or $126,491|\n|Profits|23,403 RMB or  $3,720 |156,906 RMB or $22,583|\n|Share Price|\\+/- 119$|\\+/- 70$|\n\nWhen China was friendly to the US eyes, the share price of BABA peaked at $300 and I remember that still it was considered a \"value play\" compared to its peers (FAANG or 7MAG)\n\nChina has disappointed the market with news (news from US media, reality is always different) and I beleive not a single news can disspoint investors further other than a very extreme US hollywood-driven wet dream of China invading Taiwan (it won't happen militarily, they follow a different policy with a period of 50 to 100 years planning and execution - as they work on long-term leadership, not 4 years elections circus)\n\nTheir economy is still doing better than ours in europe or the US, but they aren't active participants of press releases, conference meeting for the front page of Financial Times or election year where US population take it as a sport match.\n\n* BYD took over TESLA. \n* eCommerce in China and South Asia is BABA/Tencent playground moving trillions\n* They were the first to release 5G and subsequently US had to take them down with some drama story on Huawei\n\nChina state intervened their high growth sectors and companies bcuz their CEOs thought that they could monetise on Chinese publicly-funded resources and create an oligopoly equivalent to the US where Googles, Amazons dominate the citizens privacy, freedom and life.

I've been putting the 'new' money in safe places -- specifically VOO, SPY and BRKB.

Look at the positives:\n\n* Grown earnings 13% annually for the last 10 years\n* Has $551 million in cash with only $925 million in market cap ($8/share in cash compared to $13.78 stock price)\n* Has a laughably small 14 million in debt, which was probably just done to get an S&P credit rating\n* BBB- credit rating\n* Wealth and Asset Management revenue streams are reasonably diversified\n* Selling at 0.71x book value\n* Offering a 2.2% dividend next year\n* Earnings growth expected at \\~14% and \\~9% for 2023 and 2024 respectively\n* FWD PE of 4.32\n* 10-year PE of 15.6\n* Applied for dual listing in Hong Kong to mitigate delisting risk, which means Chinese investors can buy the stock directly soon\n* Has excellent runway as millionaires in China double over the next 5 years (7x faster than the US)\n\nAny thoughts? My thinking on the delisting risk, since that is what will worry people the most, is that in the extremely unlikely event it gets delisted (it has something like three years to rectify its books), it will still trade on the Hong Kong stock exchange where it has access to capital/investors there, and otherwise in the States it'll trade OTC (over the counter).\n\nI like think - where is this company going to be in the next ten years, or say, by 2030? It's the largest independent wealth and asset manager in china. It has 4% of the TOTAL market share (including banks) and 22% of the independent wealth and asset advisor market share. If I were to pick the best metrics for a company, it would have a ton of cash, no debt, growing earnings and revenue well, be selling under book value and deeply undervalued compared to its long term PE, and be in a growing industry. This is that.",
