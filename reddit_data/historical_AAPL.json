    "selftext": "Nvidia ([NVDA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NVDA)) has outperformed every stock in the S&P 500 ([\\^GSPC](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5EGSPC)) since\u00a0[the launch of ChatGPT\u00a0](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/how-chatgpt-changed-the-world-of-tech-in-just-one-year-180957543.html)in late November 2022 Shares in the chipmaker have risen nearly 700% since ChatGPT brought the power of artificial intelligence to the masses, far outpacing the S&P 500's roughly 45% over the same time period. The next closest gain for an S&P 500 company in that time period is a 540% pop for Vistra Corp ([VST](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/VST)).Nvidia has established itself as the key provider of chips needed to operate AI systems. Now at the epicenter of an AI arms race, Nvidia has established itself as[\u00a0a cornerstone of the recent bull market](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/live/stock-market-today-tech-leads-stocks-higher-as-nvidia-surges-to-record-high-175727614.html)\u00a0in stocks as the company's sales and profits have skyrocketed over the past several years.\n\nAhead of the\u00a0[company's next quarterly earnings release on May 28](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-to-report-q1-earnings-as-middle-east-deals-export-control-reprieve-boost-stock-122728218.html), we broke down some of the most eye-popping charts that show how Nvidia became one of the most-followed stocks in the market.There's perhaps no clearer way to see how Nvidia ran away from the competition in the AI boom than looking at the company's market capitalization against its peers. Back when ChatGPT launched, Nvidia had a market cap of just over $400 billion. It's now over $3.3 trillion. Over that same time period, chip competitor Intel's ([INTC](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/INTC)) market cap has actually decreased, while Advanced Micro Devices' ([AMD](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMD)) market cap has increased incrementally from $125 billion to $177 billion.Nvidia's rise proved to be at the center of a new technological boom. Combined with Nvidia, the rise in dominance of six other companies \u2014 Apple ([AAPL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL)), Alphabet ([GOOGL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOGL),\u00a0[GOOG](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOG)), Microsoft ([MSFT](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MSFT)), Amazon ([AMZN](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMZN)), Meta ([META](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/META)), and Tesla ([TSLA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA)) \u2014 formed what would come to be known as the\u00a0[\"Magnificent Seven.\"](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/one-chart-shows-how-the-magnificent-7-have-dominated-the-stock-market-in-2023-203250125.html)\n\nThe group began the AI boom with a combined market cap just shy of $7 billion. Now, two and a half years later, the Big Tech group's market cap is worth over $16.8 trillion. The seven companies have grown from about 22% of the S&P 500's market cap in November 2022 to 32% of the index's market cap today.Given the outsized weighting in the S&P 500, large swings in shares of Nvidia have become a feature of how even broad market investors are thinking about the direction of stocks. In June 2024,[\u00a0three Wall Street strategists boosted their year-end S&P 500 targets](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ai-enthusiasm-prompts-3-wall-street-banks-to-raise-stock-market-forecasts-100027154.html), citing better-than-expected consistent performance among key AI players.\n\nAs of May 19, the Magnificent Seven have accounted for about 52% of the S&P 500's gain since Nov. 30, 2022. Nvidia alone has contributed 17.21%, by far the most among the group, with the next closest stock, Microsoft, which has added about 8.8%.Nvidia's stock hasn't been rising from just hype. The company's quarterly financial metrics have soared. In the quarter ChatGPT launched, Nvidia posted revenue of $6.3 billion. Two years later, it would post revenue of $35.3 billion. That's a 460% increase in sales in two years. As seen in the chart below, the main source of growth for Nvidia has been its data center revenue segment, which includes the sales of its AI chips.\n\nFrom the company's fourth quarter of 2023 to its final quarter of its 2025 reporting period, data center revenue grew almost 900%.\n\nNvidia's data center revenue particularly stands out when considering its rise against peers in the industry. In the final quarter of 2024, Nvidia notched a record $35.58 billion in just data center revenue, up from $3.62 billion in the final quarter of 2022.\n\nIn comparison, Alphabet's data center revenue increased to $11.96 billion, ending 2024 up from $7.32 billion in the final quarter of 2022.\n\n\n\n",

    "title": "TSLA keeps trading like a leveraged S&P 500 ETF",
    "selftext": "Since TSLA's disastrous earnings last week, a lot of people have asked how the stock manages to be up in spite of it all. And *part* of the reason is probably that Musk managed to get away with promising to cut his involvement with DOGE back to 1-2 days per week and have this reported as \"Musk stepping back from DOGE\", as if the effects of taking a chainsaw to your own brand were linear with number of hours per week spent doing it.\n\nBut I think a lot of the reason TSLA managed to have a run of good trading days in spite of terrible earnings is that on those days, the S&P 500 was up, and TSLA seems to spend a lot of time trading like a leveraged S&P 500 ETF.\n\nI had a vague, intuitive sense of this, but I wanted to put some numbers on it. There've been 68 trading day's since Trump's inauguration (not counting the currently ongoing trading day). On 26 of those days, TSLA and the S&P 500 were both down. On 22 of those days, TSLA and the S&P 500 were both up. And there were 14 days where the S&P 500 was up while TSLA was down, but only 6 days where TSLA was up while the S&P 500 was down.\n\nSo the first thing to notice here is there's a bit of an asymmetry\u2014on days when the S&P 500 was up, TSLA was up a little more than 60% of the time, whereas on days when the S&P 500 was down, TSLA was down more than 80% of the time.\n\nThe other thing is the magnitude of the swings. On days both TSLA and the S&P 500 were up, TSLA was up more in all but two cases. But on days when TSLA and the S&P 500 were both down, TSLA was down more in *every single case.* A linear regression of TSLA's price movements and the S&P 500's gives you a slope of about 2.14, meaning that on average (and I must emphasize this is an average), if the S&P moves by 1%, TSLA can be expected to move by more than 2%.\n\nWhat's going on here? Well, first of all, TSLA should have very little ability to push around the S&P 500 by itself. It may be a \"megacap\" fund, but its weight in the S&P 500 is less than 2%, and even AAPL is less than 7%. On the other hand, S&P 500 index funds probably push around TSLA a lot\u2014inflows and outflows into index funds, whether traditional mutual funds or ETFs, result in buying and selling of the components, affecting their price. That's how index funds are *supposed* to work.\n\nThe real question is why the changes are consistently amplified. Part of the story is probably that TSLA has a high P/E ratio, and companies with high P/E ratios are just in general more sensitive to market trends (something you can see if you compare the implied volatility on growth ETFs to the implied volatility on value ETFs). I do wonder if there's an additional factor, that TSLA has been in the news a lot, contributing to its volatility, which then becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy because volatility attracts gamblers and because quants build the observed volatility into their models.\n\nAn important upshot of this: even though I am not kidding when I say I [expect SPY to go to 420](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ji8bie/spy_to_420/), I've never bought SPY puts, because I expect that *real* pain from the China tariffs hits in a few weeks, TSLA will crash even harder than the broad market. There are probably other stocks you could make this play with, though I don't have a specific one I really like. (Notably, I recently opened a short position on PLTR, then thought better of it and closed the position at a small loss after deciding their bull case was significantly less implausible than TSLA's.)\n\nEDIT: I'm a dumbass. TSLA is a high-beta stock. I've known about CAPM for years but always hear about it in the context of people wanting *low*\\-beta investments, which is probably why I blanked on applying it to TSLA.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/93e1kefdmzxe1.png?width=2156&format=png&auto=webp&s=5b2f8657743b728b226f0936f83fb6fa1f63b1ab",

There is practically no chance to manufacture those things in the US anytime soon or for a reasonable price and if these tariffs are truly non-negotiable these companies longer term outlook may be very bad.\n\nI have long straddles on tech, pharma, airlines, and some defense btw, so I don\u2019t really care if things go up or down just that things continue to swing.",

Reposting in hopes of re-sparking the discussion on this-- obviously with Trump pausing all tariffs except for China and the dip being bought, it looks like what I said would happen happened.**\n\n**However, phase 2 is just beginning.**\n\nDISCLAIMER: I THINK THEIR PLANS ARE 100% DISTILLED ORGANIC REGARDIUM. HOWEVER, THESE PLANS EXIST; IT ISN'T JUST THE DEATH THROES OF A DEMENTED OLD MAN. IT IS IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THEIR GOALS AND HOW THEY WANT TO ACHIEVE THEM, SO YOU DON'T GET WIPED OUT BY A SINGULAR MANIAC'S AMBITIONS.\n\n  \n\u201cI believe very strongly in tariffs. America is being ripped off. We\u2019re a debtor nation, and we have to tax, we have to tariff, we have to protect this country.\u201d\n\n\\--Donald Trump, 1988\n\n\n\n[Transshipment](https://china.ucsd.edu/_files/02072025-brief-identify-tariff-evasion-web.pdf) is how China bypasses US trade restrictions-- the idea is simple, just ship to an intermediate country in southeast Asia or Mexico before shipping to the United States. Since the entire goal is to evade detection, it's impossible to get direct numbers on how much Chinese originating volume comes into the U.S. in this manner, but it's estimated to be at the very least tens of billions of dollars in goods per year.\n\nThis has also been [top-of-mind from Trump's current administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/02/industry-lawmakers-applaud-president-trumps-section-232-tariffs/), with realizations that the 2018 trade war did not go to the extent of their real goals because of \"loopholes\" and negotiation failures. So, this time around, the goal is the same-- a trade war with China, but the entire world has become collateral damage.\n\nTheir goals behind the trade war with China hasn't drastically changed from 2018:\n\n* [Coward Nutlick has repeatedly hinted that \"deindustrialization is a national security risk\".](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/transcript-commerce-secretary-howard-lutnick-on-face-the-nation-with-margaret-brennan-april-6-2025/) In layman's terms, if a war ever broke out, [China would be able to pump out missiles and weapons at a faster pace.](https://go.gale.com/ps/i.do?id=GALE%7CA787225532&sid=sitemap&v=2.1&it=r&p=AONE&sw=w&userGroupName=anon%7E3a357c28&aty=open-web-entry) Peter Navarro has said that \"every time you buy a good made in China, you are financing their navy in the Taiwan strait.\" His book Death by China (2011) also details how we are dependent on their supply chains for medical supplies, electronics, and weapons.\n* Miran, senior economic advisor to Trump: [trade deficits are economic dependence.](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/2025/04/cea-chairman-steve-miran-hudson-institute-event-remarks/) True at face value, but the dependency goes both ways. As with the fundamental theory of trading and competitive advantage goes, both sides win. U.S. industry is built off the back of Chinese supply and labor, and the Chinese have become wealthy off of the largest consumer market in the world.\n\nSo, the plan that would somewhat explain their intentions behind tariffing the world is to get other countries to come to the table, fence-off Chinese transshipping, and/or strike deals that cut off Chinese suppliers to third party countries as well. This would explain why they imposed tariffs on penguin-inhabited islands such as [Heard and McDonald Island](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/apr/04/revealed-how-trump-tariffs-slugged-norfolk-island-and-uninhabited-heard-and-mcdonald-islands)\\-- closing off loopholes. They want to hurt China while hurting ourselves, but think that we can withstand the pain more than they can. It's unclear as to whether they're right, or if this game is even worth playing, but it's definitely *a plan, even if it's a bad one,* which is better for the market than having no narrative or confidence.\n\nWhat does this mean in the short term? Trump has no intention to keep unjustifiably high tariffs on everyone else *besides China.* As deals are struck, either side capitulates, it becomes clear that \"liberation day\" was just a second attempt at 2018 U.S. vs. China, which, to investors, is at least preferable to U.S. vs. The World (for seemingly no reason). With a narrative to cling onto and a return to (relative) normalcy, the markets can go up in the short term because of a universal instinct to \"buy the dip.\" The markets no longer have reason to freefall panic that a literal maniac is driving the world economy to ruin; he at least has a plan, if not a half-baked one.\n\n**\\^ this was posted on 2025-04-08 2:12PM ET.**\n\n**\"TRUMP HAS NO INTENTION TO KEEP UNJUSTIFIABLY HIGH TARIFFS ON EVERYONE ELSE BESIDES CHINA\" --me**\n\n**\"THE MARKETS CAN GO UP IN THE SHORT TERM BECAUSE OF A UNIVERSAL INSTINCT TO BUY THE DIP\" --me**\n\n**\"TO INVESTORS, U.S. VS. CHINA IS PREFERABLE TO U.S. VS. THE WORLD\" --me**\n\nHowever, as the initial panic subsides, the ramifications of \"reducing the trade deficit with China\" will set in. Numbers like earnings, inflation, consumer spending, and GDP growth will bleed. Eventually unemployment, defaults, and bankruptcies will follow, putting the Fed in an unwinnable situation. The private sector won't want to build US factories, find alternative trading partners (who will take the opportunity to increase prices), and \"reindustrialize\" because the Republicans could simply lose in a few years, and the policy is reversed. Imagine spending billions in U.S., factories paying 5x in wages, only for these cheap overseas pathways to open up again. There needs to be private sector *confidence* that these policies are set in stone, which is why Trump has continually attempted to affirm that they are. But they aren't. Cost-push inflation is going to rile the peasants in the U.S. once again to chop off the heads of the incumbents, and Republicans are projected to lose bigly in 2026 and 2028.\n\ntl;dr: Since the goal is to \"Reduce the trade deficit with China,\" this will directly eat into profit margins of U.S. companies and the spending power of the working class, at a failed attempt to reindustrialize America. China may be hurt as well; but in this future, it may be at a cost of a popping AI bubble and a new U.S. depression.\n\n**UPDATE AFTER TRUMP HAS PAUSED ALL TARIFFS EXCEPT FOR CHINA**\n\nI think this is a bit of corroboration to my original theory that global tariffs was an attempt to strong-arm the rest of the world into U.S.'s side against China. If you were to get my opinion on whether this was the most intelligent or reasonable way to do it, I obviously have an endless amount of things to say. But my opinion doesn't matter; this post is simply trying to discern their ambitions, and how they will try to achieve them. Understanding the incentives behind this chaos is of supreme importance to best navigate it.\n\nWho are these people that Trump has surrounded himself with? Navarro, Miran, Lighthizer, Kudlow, Barr, Bannon, Mnuchin, Rubio, Waltz, Helberg, Bolton, Pottinger, Wray...\n\nNavarro refused to comply with a Jan. 6 subpoena, in 2023 was sentenced to 4 months in prison. He also promoted Lab Leak conspiracies and has had a long history of questionable policy advocacy, solely focused on how China is \"ripping off the world.\" Trump's rhetoric on China, trade deficits, and tariffs is almost ripped straight from Navarro's various books. Lighthizer and Miran have long advocated for using high tariffs as a coercive weapon, and have had histories of downplaying the effects of retaliation on domestic industries. Some of these anti-China allies are truly focused on national security with legitimate concerns over IP theft and Chinese rapid militarization.\n\nAre these people the originators of Trump's ideology, or did Trump select the fringe, controversial figures in economics and defense that corroborated with his worldview? It's unclear, but no matter how this unified political stance came to be, the conclusion is simple:\n\n**Trump's administration believes that national security vs. China is the critical goal that potentially supercedes the Stock Market, domestic industrial stability, inflation, and the buying power of the average American. They are willing to destroy access to Chinese supply chains to force America to \"decouple\" with China.** **They don't care about Apple, Tesla, the S&P 500, etc; for one, Trump thinks that the Fed will eventually do ZIRP and infinite QE to pump the stocks once more, and that slashing 50% off of Apple is worth it as long as they find other suppliers or build domestic supply chains.**\n\n**He believes in \"short term pain,\" however, in a year or a few years, U.S. capital dominance will survive, after purging the \"dependency\" on China.**\n\nSimply put:\n\nAAPL, TSLA, WMT, NKE, BBY, QCOM, INTC 2026 PUTS.\n\nHowever, in the short term, stocks will continue to pump as the \"apocalypse cancelled; buy the dip\" reflex continues over the rest of the week.\n\n\\---\n\n**Epilogue**  \nUneducated peasants gave Mao Zedong power because he was an iconoclast that claimed he could save them from a feudalistic society. When in power, he instead implemented his theory that none of his base understood.\n\n45 million starved. The rest ate bark and dirt.",

    "selftext": "***TLDR;*** *Analysts have emphasized the impacts of tariffs on commodities, autos, and tangible goods. However, the escalation of this tariff trade war will most significantly impact digital goods.*\n\n***The Play TLDR***; *Short tech (QQQ puts, SPY puts, SOXL puts)*  \n\n\nOn April 2nd, we will (allegedly) learn what Donald Trump's plan will be for \"rolling back unfair trade practices that have been ripping off America\". Currently, analysts are primarily focused on illustrating the impacts of these tariffs on commodities and industrials. Understandably, since these asset classes are most commonly included in U.S. top export metrics:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/azbupva7p4se1.png?width=477&format=png&auto=webp&s=38847b3d9ae4e0c455639abd44c036e1ec923be9\n\n  \n***THE POINT:***\n\n  \nIn 1998, the World Trade Organization (WTO) temporarily banned tariffs on a class of assets called \"electronic transmissions\" (digital goods). This decision was made due to the rapid and unparalleled emergence of a new medium of information exchange called **the \"internet\".**\n\n  \nThis ban prevented members from charging tariffs on goods provided electronically over the web. This temporary ban has been reviewed every two years by member countries, with the outcome being that it is mutually beneficial to keep the moratorium in place.  \nThis moratorium has played a ***critical*** role in U.S. tech's profitability:\n\n\n\n[Current framework of free digital trade](https://preview.redd.it/sfyu2o6gp4se1.jpg?width=768&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d4025959602f933ad83942912a6ffadfda84f97b)\n\nIn the example above, a company providing digital goods/services can trade freely with other countries. Digital transactions are not treated like physical goods transported internationally, where the goods must be declared at customs and taxes paid on their value.\n\n  \nThis framework has been deemed to be in the best interest of the world for **decades**, and all political parties have managed to put aside their differences to ensure this framework's survival for the greater good. However, ***Trump's current economic offensive has put this framework at risk when/if other countries decide to \"strike back\":***  \n\n\n[Framework for digital trade under tariffs](https://preview.redd.it/8ty1db2sp4se1.jpg?width=768&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c14880088e780e48b6796d64f5295d40e572fd0c)\n\n***THE PROBLEM:***\n\nNearly [$270B or 70% of U.S. \"services\" exports](https://project-disco.org/21st-century-trade/new-government-data-shows-digital-services-exports-continue-to-drive-u-s-trade/) come from digital goods. Referring to the first picture of this post, this is roughly $62B more than the current top U.S. tangible goods export (Cars/Car parts (implied)). \n\nThe problem, then, is derived from the following:\n\n[\\>50&#37; of the revenue of the S&P 500 IT sectors comes from foreign countries](https://preview.redd.it/7oxbsiqis4se1.png?width=520&format=png&auto=webp&s=7c978c1b69a7f9b22ee05f14060974c87508e801)\n\nNVDA, GOOG, META, AAPL, and other tech stocks would incur significant losses from the termination of the 1998 e-commerce moratorium.\n\n***The Endgame:*** \n\nThe tariffs proposed by the Trump administration will **invalidate** the 1998 WTO moratorium agreement **->** Foreign governments looking to push back against the U.S. tariffs will target U.S. tech and digital goods/services **->** U.S. tech margins will contract, as they are forced to account for taxes/tariffs on services provided internationally (i.e. Netflix pays tariffs on shows streamed by consumers in Europe) **->** U.S. economy will enter a recession due to the concentration of the top 10% of wealth (locked in the stock market) compromising \\~50% of all U.S. spending\n\n\n\n***Positions:***\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ujzs3n0hx4se1.jpg?width=839&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ffad43ac5e67af7df8b64e6347467ecc11118c38\n\nSources:\n\nDigital Services GDP: [https://project-disco.org/21st-century-trade/new-government-data-shows-digital-services-exports-continue-to-drive-u-s-trade/](https://project-disco.org/21st-century-trade/new-government-data-shows-digital-services-exports-continue-to-drive-u-s-trade/)\n\nOEC Tangible Goods Data: [https://oec.world/en/profile/country/usa](https://oec.world/en/profile/country/usa)\n\nWTO Moratorium: [https://web.wtocenter.org.tw/file/PageFile/386868/WTGCW889.pdf](https://web.wtocenter.org.tw/file/PageFile/386868/WTGCW889.pdf)",

    "title": "Apple is reportedly losing $1 billion a year on its streaming service as churn levels increase",
    "selftext": "Apple's (AAPL) streaming platform is losing a reported $1 billion a year as the company faces stiff competition and a more choosy consumer.\n\nAccording to a report in the Information, Apple \u2014 which just shed around $700 billion as a result of Wall Street's latest tech rout \u2014 has consistently spent over $5 billion annually to beef up its content slate since launching in 2019. That number, though, dramatically decreased to just about $500 million last year, the report said.\n\nApple did not immediately respond to Yahoo Finance's request for comment.\n\nThe update comes as many media giants have pulled back on spending in favor of profitability. More streaming platforms are cracking down on password sharers and have also bundled their respective offerings to prevent churn, or users abandoning their subscription plans.\n\nLast year, Apple partnered with Netflix (NFLX) and Comcast's Peacock (CMCSA) to launch a new bundle dubbed StreamSaver, exclusively available to Comcast broadband internet service customers for a cost of $15 a month. The monthly price of a solo Apple TV+ subscription currently sits at $9.99, although users can bundle Apple's streaming service with other Apple-related products like Apple Arcade and Apple News+.\n\nIt's unclear whether the recent bundles are helping.\n\nAccording to data compiled by subscription analytics platform Antenna, Apple's streaming service had the highest churn percentage of all the major streaming platforms, with the exclusion of Starz, with 7% of users churning out of the service during the month of February, compared to just 2% of users for Netflix and 4% of users for Disney+.\n\nNotably, Apple has adopted a strategy different from that of its competitors. For one, its content slate is more limited, although it does boast highly acclaimed titles, including award-winning series like \"Severance,\" \"Shrinking,\" and \"Ted Lasso.\" It was also the first streaming platform to take home an Oscar win for best picture (thanks to \"Coda\").\n\nIn total, Apple TV+ productions have earned more than 2,500 nominations and 538 wins, CEO Tim Cook said on the company's January earnings call.\n\nApple TV+ does not release subscriber figures, although analysts have pegged total users at anywhere from 30 million to 40 million. Compared to Netflix, which boasts over 300 million subscribers thanks to its substantial global presence, Apple TV+ does not have high penetration in emerging markets, which have become increasingly important drivers as streaming hits peak saturation levels in the US and Canada.\n\n\"Apple's streaming service never set out to be No. 1,\" Santosh Rao, head of research at Manhattan Venture Partners, previously told Yahoo Finance. \"Apple is good at the game that they play, but it's not a mass appeal game. They want to be the creative storytellers. They're more focused.\"\n\nIn January, Apple reported first quarter earnings that showed all-time highs for services revenue, which includes sales from businesses like Apple TV+, along with the App Store and Apple Music. Revenue for the division climbed to $26.34 billion for the period, compared to $23.12 billion in the prior year.",

I can imagine META employees dumping their stock and not holding, GOOGL employees usually do auto sale, but the ones who kept it and didn't sell probably did well.\n\nMSFT and AAPL employees also did well.

Criminally Low P/E Ratio\n\nWhile all your other tech darlings are flexing P/E ratios like a hooker in heat, $GOOGL is at 23.4 P/E ratio.\n\nFor reference:\n* $SPX: >27 P/E (yes, the S&P500)\n* $MSFT: >36 P/E\n* $AAPL: >39 P/E\n* $NVDA: >56 P/E\n* $AMZN: >47 P/E\n* $TSLA: >106 P/E (Fuck you, for the window lickers in the back)\n\nRemember a \u201cgood\u201d P/E ratio is traditionally around 20-25. If you don\u2019t understand then read a fucking book.\n\n2. AI Incumming\n\nSure, everyone\u2019s talking about OpenAI and ChatGPT, but who\u2019s making real money here? Google owns 90%+ of search traffic (when did you ever hear \u201cyahoo it\u201d or \u201cask duck duck go\u201d?) and monetizes it like a legal cartel.

Santa Rally - Ho Ho Hold Onto Your Bollocks \ud83c\udf85\n\nHistorically, December is green season for big-cap tech. Funds rebalance, and retail apes are YOLOing.

Are investors ready for a new \u201csuper cycle\u201d?**\n\n  \n**Monday, $ Apple (AAPL.US)$ closed up 0.95%, shares rose to $ 239.59, hitting a new record high, the total market capitalization exceeded 3.62 trillion U.S. dollars, regaining the first global market value throne, compared with the second place of the NVIDIA has been higher than 250 billion U.S. dollars.

The strong performance of Apple's stock price not only reflects the company's growth momentum, but also shows investors' confidence in its future development. What are the driving factors behind this upward trend?\n\n  \nOutstanding earnings performance. In the fourth fiscal quarter, when the new generation of iPhones just hit the market, the revenue of Apple's core product, iPhone, returned to positive growth, and the growth momentum exceeded Wall Street's expectations, driving the company's total revenue to a record high for the same period. The solid financial situation undoubtedly provides investors with confidence.\n\nTechnology innovation and AI strategic layout. While the core products are changing, Apple is also launching new products, from Apple Watch to smart home products, to meet the diversified needs of consumers. In addition, Apple's continued expansion in emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence has laid the foundation for its future growth with the gradual release of Apple's AI capabilities.\n\nGlobal market expansion. Apple's sales revenue in Europe, Japan and other Asia-Pacific regions outside of China and Japan all accelerated in the fourth fiscal quarter, such as India, Southeast Asia and Africa, which have low smartphone penetration rates and huge market potential, are also growing rapidly. At the same time, Apple is also promoting the relocation of the industrial chain, especially to emerging markets such as India, with a view to further reducing costs, expanding production capacity and developing new market growth points.\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n",

    "title": "Trimming Appl before Berkshire results tomorrow ",
    "selftext": "Investors may want to consider trimming their Apple (AAPL) positions based on recent developments and upcoming events. Here's why:\n\n## Apple's Recent Performance\n\nApple's latest earnings report has raised some concerns among investors. The company reported a decline in global iPhone sales for the second consecutive quarter, partly due to increased competition in China from companies like Huawei[3]. This slowdown in Apple's flagship product could signal challenges ahead for the tech giant.\n\n## Berkshire Hathaway's Significant Reduction\n\nWarren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A, BRK.B) has made a notable move by cutting its stake in Apple by nearly 50% during the second quarter of 2024[1][2]. This reduction came after Berkshire had already trimmed its Apple holdings by 13% in the first quarter[1]. Such a significant divestment by a long-term, value-focused investor like Buffett could be interpreted as a cautionary signal.\n\n## Potential for Further Trimming\n\nWith Berkshire Hathaway set to report earnings tomorrow, investors should pay close attention. Apple's stock price has risen by approximately $15 since the end of September when Berkshire made its substantial cut. This increase, coupled with Berkshire's recent selling pattern, suggests that another trim in Berkshire's Apple holdings is possible[4].\n\n## Broader Market Considerations\n\nBerkshire's actions may reflect broader concerns about the U.S. economy. The company has increased its cash reserves to a record $277 billion, which could indicate a more cautious outlook on equities in general[5]. This substantial cash position might be seen as a hedge against potential market volatility or economic uncertainty.\n\n## Investor Takeaway\n\nWhile Apple remains a strong company with significant market presence, these factors combined suggest that investors might want to reassess their positions:\n\n1. Apple's slowing iPhone sales and increased competition\n2. Berkshire's substantial reduction in Apple holdings\n3. The possibility of further trimming by Berkshire\n4. Overall market and economic uncertainties\n\nGiven that the onions for appl options will be down after earnings, this would be an excellent time to short appl. This is not financial advice.\n\nSources\n[1] Apple Stock Falls Amid Broad Selloff as Berkshire Hathaway Trims ... https://www.investopedia.com/apple-stock-falls-warren-buffett-berkshire-hathaway-trims-stake-again-8690248\n[2] Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Cuts Stake in Apple by Half https://www.pymnts.com/apple/2024/buffetts-berkshire-hathaway-cuts-stake-in-apple-by-half/\n[3] Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway sells half its Apple stock https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/03/warren-buffets-berkshire-hathaway-sells-half-its-apple-stock/\n[4] Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway cuts stake in Apple by nearly ... https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/03/business/berkshire-hathaway-apple-stock/index.html\n[5] Berkshire Hathaway sells off large share of Apple and increases ... https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/aug/03/berkshire-hathaway-warren-buffett-sells-off-apple-increases-cash-holdings\n",

Now I'm seeing the same thing with Crocs. People don\u2019t care that they look like shit anymore; they think it's fashion now. You know those charms you put in the holes of Crocs? Every kid wants them these days. They don\u2019t realize you can get the exact same charms from China for 5% of the price. That\u2019s what I did, and I\u2019ve been rocking the same Crocs for 6 years now. Those crocodiles know how to make shoes man...... Also McDonalds put mini Crocs toys in their happy meals.

Although a pullback is always expected when a stock price explores to a new high, but a breakdown lower is highly unlikely and is not what I expect to see heading up to election day. Their earnings are 11/2, 3 days before election. Berkshire has never seen volatility like it has recently and that will play a huge factor in is price action. The company's core assets reside in sectors such as insurance, energy, and consumer goods. Recently they sliced their holding of $AAPL in half, reducing their position to only 2.6% of the outstanding shares. Even  after concluding their sales $AAPL remains Berkshires largest holding at roughly 30% of their portfolio. Furthermore, their cash balance sits at a whopping $277 billion. This is my analysis of Berkshire Hathaway and why I think they will see upside heading towards election, what are your guys thoughts?",

    "selftext": "\nTL;DR - Dad got cancer - so I went ham on investing \n\nI've been a long time lurker of this sub (and I never really post on reddit in general), but I didn't know where else to post this. I don't do options so maybe this is the wrong place lmao.\n\nI moved back home to my parents place when my dad was diagnosed with terminal brain cancer. Truthfully this has been the worst year of my life (and his obviously) in a lot of ways, but I've been investing since I was 16 (I'm 25 now). My dad worked in equities, so when he lost his ability to communicate effectively with me (and since I had significantly more income because I'm not paying rent) - I truthfully went ballistic on investing.\n\nPretty much said fuck it, I'm living at home I don't need a 6 month emergency fund till I move out and went all-in. Granted 40% of my portfolio not listed here is in a 401k account entirely in the S&P 500 (set & forget just in case my equities went to hell as with the rest of my life lol).\n\nI believe in the margin of safety when investing. I like to invest in high-quality companies that generate lots of cash as the backbone of my portfolio. Since 2021 (before my dad got this cancer shit), I spoke with him and he basically said just look at the fundamentals of a company and invest in growth companies that you think will be around in 5-10 years. I look for value within growth stocks (i know paradoxical). Some of my icons in investing are David Tepper & Michael Burry. Again below is all my own experience and reflects **only** my own views and are not a recommendation of my company (corporate. disclaimer).\n\n* My portfolio is heavily weighted (85%) between several stocks: AAPL, META, MSFT, GOOGL (So fucking cheap r u kidding me sorry), NVDA, AMZN, AMD, CRM, COST, RIVN (RIP), AVGO, VOO (ik not a stock) <-- I know semi(s) are very cyclical but i believe in holding all of these companies for 5-10 years, so I don't have to worry about temp. earnings beats/misses etc. Much easier to pick a stock and hold it for a while then it is to get the timing right. Roughly at 175% return in the past 3 years. (hammered META at $100's, NVDA at $200 both in 2022)\n* Roughly 15% of my bets are moonshots (note the word bet hehe) with promise but objectively could be overvalued/bad investments: CCL/RCL (both are crushing it and between them own 75% of the cruise line market), LCID/RIVN (going to 0 bc they can't scale profitably or will make u a very happy person 3 years down the line bc R2/Atlas at 45k/50k should capture a significant portion of model y demand), TTD, DKNG/FLUT - gambling hasn't even been legalized in Cali/Texas (the biggest markets in the U.S. come on), RBLX (feels like betting against youtube in the early innings w/o realizing how much rev. they're actually recognizing), PYPL (value - cheap af (bought at $60) should turn around in a couple years)\n\nI joke I allocate like google's budget where it's 90% bread&butter and the rest are moonshots.\n\nWas very depressed (still reasonably depressed) because I'm not sure how much time my dad has. I hope in a way I can pass some of these stocks to my kid in a better place than I found it. I don't know I'm crying as I write this. Fuck my life. It is what it is. \n\nCheers\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j8ym4lkamdvd1.png?width=1198&format=png&auto=webp&s=70c707919d6301944c8ff8cbbcb33ed03c9e6837",

    "selftext": "I'm new, please don't bully me, I have no clue what is going on which is why I use really basic concepts in my explanation.\n\nGrowth Investment vs. Value Investment. \u00a0\n\nOne one hand, there are growth stocks; Wall Street currently is in overdrive, investors are hyper-optimistic and companies like tickers: TSMC and NVDA are trading far above their average P/E ratios, these types of companies are called growth stocks because investors are betting that in the future, their \u201cvaluations\u201d will be justified by NVDA\u2019s performance, instead of investing in intrinsic value, shareholders are investing in the IMPLICIT VALUE of a company, which is what they perceive the future intrinsic value of a company will be.\u00a0\n\nWhen the economy is doing well (as it is now, kinda, I think), growth stocks do well; this is because demand for goods and services goes up, interest rates go down, revenues for businesses go up, borrowing is cheaper and technology companies like NVDA can capitalize off of that to fund R&D, growing the scale of operations and benefitting from economies of scale, justifying the IMPLICIT VALUATIONS, raising stock prices to the stratosphere.\u00a0\n\nOn the other hand, when the economy is receding as part of its natural cycle, the economy gets a \u201creality check\u201d, investors realize that their growth valuations were too optimistic and that their predictions won\u2019t mature soon enough to achieve their desired ROI per annum. As a result, they flock to value investments because they realize that companies like Bank of America are resilient, undervalued and going to grow in a high-interest environment which we could be looking at in December.\u00a0\n\nThe same thing happens in a bubble, and it is no secret that AI is a bubble as of now considering the ludicrous difference in implicit and intrinsic valuations.\u00a0\n\nLooking at NVDA, it is easy to see how we could be looking at the first half of a repeat of the 3D Printing bubble in 2014. \u00a0\n\nThat is not to say that, 3D printing is akin to AI, however, it is almost guaranteed that NVDA fill be facing a significant correction (like AAPL did in December 2022 and December 2023) after a rally due to the incoming CPI data (unlike AAPL).\u00a0\n\nWe are too late to invest in growth stocks and too early to buy value stocks, so we are faced with a dilemma:\u00a0\n\n\n\nHow can we invest on the tipping point of the economy\u2019s growth?\u00a0\n\nTo be honest, I have no fucking clue, however, with CPI data coming 8:00 E.T, that could change: if CPI is significantly higher than before, a world of high interest rate December will become much more visible, if it is significantly lower, then we will see a big rally for companies like NVDA. Anything in between a clear-cut CPI , will just muddy the waters as the stock market is rife with AI speculative delusion.\u00a0\n\nWhat is certain, however, is that NVDA, sooner or later, will get a really painful reality check, and if you don\u2019t believe me, you shouldn't, because I don't know what I'm yapping about.\n\nWhat is going to happen?

But of course their margins are different - AAPL\u2019s is close to **25%**, while NVDA\u2019s is close to **50%**. That\u2019s how we get net income in the last quarter of **21.45B** for AAPL and **16.6B** for NVDA. All else equal then, NVDA\u2019s value should be about 77.39% of AAPL\u2019s. Looking at today\u2019s market caps we have AAPL at **3.383T** and NVDA at **2.649T**, which puts NVDA\u2019s value at 78.30% of AAPL\u2019s, or roughly 1.3% overvalued based on net income alone.\u00a0\n\nBut of course all else is not equal. As you know, a company\u2019s valuation is based upon future earnings, not past. When we look at the past quarter, we see that AAPL\u2019s net income **declined 9.26%** from the previous quarter, while NVDA\u2019s **increased by 11.56**%. Even if Apr-Jun is typically a low quarter for AAPL, looking at year over year change in net income, shows us **7.88%** growth for AAPL compared to **168.24%** for NVDA.\n\nWhy then does NVDA have only a one percent premium over AAPL based upon net income, when NVDA\u2019s net income grew 46.7% more in the past quarter than AAPL\u2019s did in the past year?\n\nOne more thing: I haven\u2019t accounted for after-hours action, so NVDA\u2019s slight premium over AAPL based upon net income alone is probably gone now.\n\nPositions: Long NVDA, NVDU, NVDA Dec calls.\n\nThis is not financial advice.",

Some of you regards might say that \"OH THEIR STOCK PRICE INCREASED 150% YOY HOW IS THAT NOT OVERPRICED\", I will kindly ask you to check their income growth, which sits at 122% YOY.\n\nFirst of all, lets compare some other tech giants earnings to NVDA earnings to see what they are \"worth now\".\n\n|Name|Stock price|EPS|SP/EPS ratio|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|AAPL|230|1,4|164|\n|MSFT|413|2,95|140|\n|AMD|145|0,16|1.035|\n|META|516|5,16|100|\n|AMZN|171|1,26|135|\n|NVDA|116|0,68|170|\n\nAs you can see above, they are not overpriced related to their current earnings. And I think that them going back to 110 will set them good for later improvements. But them getting hyped beyond recognition was the sole reason for them being priced at 130 per price.\n\nBut before jumping into the NVDA analysis, lets go over every single tech stock in that list.\n\n## AAPL\n\nLatest thing they achieved was M1 chip, converting old and worthless Macbook Pro hardware into a performing machine with great battery life. This was also accompanied by the fact that they can charge a premium for small hardware upgrades (200$ for a simple 256GB storage?), which helped them to sell new computers to their old customers and gain huge profits.\n\nHow do I know this? Because after 2021, when M1 chip proved to be powerful and resourceful, most of our Macbook stack got renewed. I was using a 6 years old work Macbook before that, because newer Intel Macbooks did not promise anything new.\n\nBut this was 3 years ago. Now, they are pretty much failing to create new income markets. Their latest tech demo \"Vision Pro\" failed miserably. Their only means to increase their income is to sell more hardware to push their services (AppStore and stuff), but this is also under investigation and they probably will have to open up their ecosystem more.\n\n## MSFT\n\nThey did suck tits before Nadella became a CEO. They tried to be a \"everything\" company but everything they did suck. Then Nadella came and transformed the rotting corpse of MSFT on the Golden Throne into the Cloud giant they are.\n\nThey are platformless. Their services are used everywhere. They are bringing Windows into ARM devices (again) and it does not suck this time. New ARM platform seems to outperform M series Macbooks in battery performance, which will end years of Macbook supremacy.\n\nThey are agile. They set and integrate trends easier. Game Pass? Azure? Cloud Office?\n\n## AMD\n\nI am a fellow AMD user (7900XTX gang?) and oh boy they are at least a few years behind in datacenter solutions. Also given their driver problem history on Desktop, power draw problems and other bugs, they need more resources to fix their problems first.\n\nAlso, sadly, they do not have CUDA. Personally, I am training some neural networks on my 7900XTX and it is 5 to 10 times faster than my CPU but also 5 to 10 times slower than NVDA counterpart. And also, I have to put in the extra work to find that specific framework that works with AMD and make the very specific adjustments before even I can start using the hardware.\n\nEven if their hardware can match NVDA, it is like having a really fast fighter jet without any software assistance, yeah you can MAYBE safely take off if you work hard enough, but you will never win against the jest with a strong software.\n\nAnd no one is buying their data center products (Other than their CPU's). I will get on this in NVDA's section.\n\n## META\n\nThey are a \"AD\" company, just like Google. They have some \"long game\" products (Metaverse and Google Self Driving as much as you joke them), but they are far from ALPHA phase. If they can show the world that this is the future, they might get a 60% to 90% increase in their value.\n\nALSO THEY ARE BUYING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF WORTH NVDA PRODUCTS.\n\n## AMZN\n\nThe \"everything company\". They are big. But not as much profitable as the rest. For me, their biggest product is AWS. If they can create a new income source they will be the next 3T company, may be even earlier than GOOGL.\n\n# NVDA\n\nAND OUR STAR CHILD.\nHOT TOPIC OF 2024.\nTHE FUTURE OF THE WORLD.\n\nDo you remember when they wanted to acquire ARM? This was back in 2020, when their market cap was around 145 BILLION. Do you know how much they were willing to spend on ARM? 40 BILLION DOLLARS. This was before the AI craze and boom in their revenue.\n\nSo why did NVDA wanted to acquire ARM? For their CPU's of course. They are going to create the Apple way of Datacenters. Soft spot of H100 series was their lack of integration between CPU and GPU. Blackwell aims to solve this. Finally, they are creating a whole SOC, with their new CPU, Grace.\n\nRemember what I told you in AAPL's section? The way their tight integration of M series chips with rest of the system made their profits skyrocket? Do you see what will Blackwell do for NVDA now?\n\nH100 users will have a clear path to upgrade, and with their newest technology, they will get MORE OF THE PIE on the single server rack. If NVDA made X thousand dollars of profits from a single server rack from H100 users, this will definitely go beyond 4X mark with Blackwell.\n\nAnd I previously mentioned no one was buying AMD. This was because in our company, we have bought A MILLION DOLLARS worth of NVDA datacenter products. There was a discussion in our team, if we should buy AMD datacenter GPU's because it was WAY cheaper, I mean 4-5 times cheaper. Everyone disagreed and we went with the NVDA GPU and AMD CPU, and we are just one team in a huge company.\n\nRemember when I told you I was a THIRD WORLD REGARD? Yeah. NVDA technologies are just spreading to this part of the world. Even we are spending MILLIONS of dollars for NVDA. And we are just starting to build up our NVDA datacenters. What do you think in 5 years, when it is time to upgrade, do you think that we will switch our provider and ditch all the work? Or do you think that we will go with NVDA and make them rich?\n\nLet the bears win some battles, so NVDA can win the war.\n\nEDIT: forgor some words",

    "title": "The next tech giant. Why $HOOD, $PLTR and $DKNG are the investment opportunities of a lifetime. (Part 1)",
    "selftext": "I believe the story of the last 20 years of stock market is that one tech startup can disrupt an entire sector and join the tech giant club. For many sectors, information is king and turns out a company with a few 1000 people who have studied the science of information can outperform millions of people who aren't so scientifically rigorous. Now some sectors are not so prone to be disrupted by these information science experts. And if you asked me 20 years ago which sectors will be disrupted in what order, I would've guessed wrong.\n\n$AMZN Turns out the value of millions of retail stores across the west was not in their inventory, their brand or their location. Amazon proved their value was in knowing who wants what item when and where. Information. How can millions of retail shop compete with amazon when they already have my payment information (how) my location (where) and all amazon has to figure out is what do I want, which I'm happy to tell them by typing one word or expression in a search bar instead of walking around Home Depot trying to find a employee who's not too busy and has every reason to avoid me. Sentences and social interactions just can't compete with 1s and 0s. Now I wish I figured this all out 20 years ago when amazon still a great investment opportunity, but how could I have known Jeff would overcome all the hurdles by building this impossible network of warehouses and delivery. I won't make the same mistake twice.\n\n$NFLX (movies). $SPOT (music) $GOOG,$META(ads, communication, media), $AAPL, $MSFT etc... These are 100% information sectors that I would've guessed would be disrupted. But these were winner takes all. How could I know Facebook wouldn't fail like MySpace and Friendster? That iphones would be better than blackberry and nokia? How could I know Yahoo would become a total failure when they had such a commanding lead in the early internet era. These stocks will keep going up but they're not the 100 baggers they once were.\n\nAnd so in true\u00a0wsb\u00a0fashion, the question becomes, what tech startup is poised to do the same thing to their respective sector. Let's assume no company can be worth over $5T in the next 10 years. We need a company worth less than $50B whose sector is still ripe for the taking, and whose in the business of information. A sector whose legal hurdles have kept the incumbents safe from the efficiency of tech startups. A sector who created legal barriers that could resist a decade longer than taxi drivers could resist $Uber, or hotels vs $ABNB.\n\nThere are 3 answers : Finance, defense and gambling. These sectors have the highest barrier to entry of any. Their regulatory agencies are basically just a revolving door between government and industry. They are the most regulated sectors out there but they are finally starting to crack. Crony capitalism only works for so long.\n\nFrom a pure computer science perspective, overtaking these sectors is not technical challenge, in the same way Unity is failing at becoming the universal game engine. There's no legal barrier to become a game engine. Activison, Take two interactive, Ubisoft, etc.. everyone wants $U to succeed but they're now years behind on their promised revolutionary Data oriented technology stack. Everyone wants $TSLA Full self driving to succeed, but they're years behind Musk's first promises of success by what? 2017?. But those are technically hard challenges, maybe impossible with current hardware limitations. Now if you want to bet on their success, good luck to you but I'm not interested in those investments. Only someone at the cutting-edge of those technologies can make well-informed decisions. Only someone at the cutting-edge of semi conducters could've guessed $NVDA would obliterate intel and amd. I won't pretend to have any such knowledge about the future as I make these observations about the past. This is not what this tech investment thesis is about.\n\nAnd so in conclusion, three stocks stand out in their positioning and the state of their respective industry :\n\nIf you are under 40 years old, $HOOD (Finance), $PLTR (Defense) and $DKNG (gambling) will 100x during your investment horizon. Part 2 tomorrow as I dive deeper on all 3.",

These are 40 stocks that Stacy's mom might not have heard of, but our millenial buddies use these products and services all the time. This is a serious list.\n\nTo start off, we'll go big in the cap spectrum.\n\nOur millenial buys AAPL products, uses MSFT Excel and Outlook at their \"Information Worker\" job. They are frequently gamers, so they need to buy NVDA GPUs and AMD CPUs. They often buy these at AMZN.\n\nThey buy YouTube Premium and YouTube TV, so they can skip the ads of their fellow influencers (GOOGL)\n\nThey spent most of their waking hours at META's Instagram website.\n\nThey drive a TSLA or RIVN.\n\nThey're on the GLP-1 drug (LLY) to impress their SOs.\n\nThey're churning their credit cards with AXP Platinum and Gold, JPM's Chase Sapphire Preffered (no, NOT Reserve), some younger ones need to rely on COF's Venture and Venture X cards that gave nice \"subs\".\n\nThey use these cards frequently to eat out and earn those points at CMG, SHAK and SG.\n\nThey're flying a lot on DAL, and they need their free wifi that is often sponsored by their preferred choice of mobile carrier, TMUS.\n\nTo get to the airport they need to use UBER or LYFT, since they don't want to drive their sweet electric ride. When they arrive at their destination airport, they pick up their rental car, and of course they prefer AVIS (CAR), but their credit cards give them presential circle status on HTZ, so they are ok with that too.\n\nThey check into their hotel room at Marriott (MAR) to impress their friends, but really they are using all their Chase points to book Hyatt (H) hotels. The slightly less premium young ones will have to go Hilton (HLT) and fly on UAL.\n\nThey often booked all this travel on EXPE or BKNG. Sometimes they use ABNB.\n\nWhen they check in they need to get some food, so they use their DASH gift card they bought at COST every two weeks because they get 20% off.\n\nWhen they go to Vegas, they prefer to stay in WYNN, because it's where all the hot ones stay.\n\nAfter they're done with their holidaying which they do basically 4 months out of the year, they're going to ULTA or LULU to buy their beauty products or Khakis.\n\nThey are drop shipping on SHOP and sometimes they need to use ZM to conduct \"business\" for their \"coaching classes\" that they teach. A lot of times they get paid using Venmo (PYPL).\n\nWhatever money they make, they buy call options on HOOD.\n\nAt the end of the day their sugar daddy's give them a $1m deposit so they can buy those nice suburban homes built by TOL and furnished by WSM.\n\nAnd of course, they spend their entire day on RDDT.",

Now that we see signs of inflation coming down we will see a big sell off in tech stocks as soon as we get the rate cut. Smart money will try to lock in long term CDs and rotate to value, things that happened to LULU/SBUX/NKE will happen to most of the tech stocks. \n\nwe already seen examples of it (Buffet cut AAPL, Ackman bought NKE, Burry added BABA) therefore I think now is a good time to go long BABA.\n\n  \nShort term play:\n\nBABA is about to do something called Stock Connect. I had no idea what it was so did a search on it.\n\n[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/alibabas-hong-kong-listed-shares-093000723.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/alibabas-hong-kong-listed-shares-093000723.html)\n\nBasically investors from Mainland China can invest in BABA through Stock Connect if approved by September 9. Up to $12 billion might flow into BABA from Mainland China. You know they will front run this like they did with Bitcoin ETF. There might be a short term play here to make some money.\n\n  \nPosition 300 shares at 80.",

Its clear that buffet has geopolitical risks on the top of his mind, aapl would be obliterated in the case of a taiwan war. \n\nAfterall, why wouldn't he sell his American express position in a material way, wouldn't they get hit hard in a recession as well with delinquencies and decreased consumer spending? \n\nI guess this post doesn't really offer much reassurance as a taiwan war would be worse than a recession. But honestly I think you should trade like it wouldn't happen because if it does it would probably devolve into nuclear war and currency would be irrelevant at that point. Just my 2 cents.",

The main difference now is that there is AI and a better overall experience that can be sold at a higher price than usual. I can see how they will try to implement a better paywalled AI around the release of iOS 19, boosting other services with an Apple One pack. \n\n# No one upgrades, except this time\n\nOlder iPhones are not AI capable, and everyone that wants the new toy will have a reason to upgrade, the first real reason to upgrade since the iPhone X release. \n\n\n\nNot to mention the countless memes we will get, 2008 style dumb Siri videos.

    "selftext": "January 2024: market starts to price in anticipated 4-5 rate cuts in 2024. Tech moons. Small/Mid caps stagnant. for the first quarter you could make bank - i made 30k through march and withdrew that shit to pay for my kids school.\n\nApril 2024: I am now a reformed bear continuing bull strategy from the first 6 weeks: S\\*P drop 5.4% through April 19 - higher than expected inflation date. Push rates higher, lower # of anticipated rate cuts.  I got hammered trying the same call strategy. Gave away 15k if not more.\n\nMay 2024: AI AI AI every time you say AI in your earnings call the price goes up $1. S&P up 5.96%\n\nJune 2024: News Report: tech doesn't even need a rate cut to continue the bull run. June 12 $AAPL says \"APPLE INTELLIGENCE\", reaches all time highs. (puts for their earnings btw). $NVDA 140% for the year? After last year we were like WTF how is this 300 a share let alone 1400 a share in June.\n\nJuly 2024 $GOOG $AMZN up \\~80-100% for the year.\n\nLook, its logical to take profits. No shame in that especially for retail who loses out 90% of the time.\n\nJuly 2024: Rate cuts like 99.999% almost certain for sept. Now suddenly Small/Mid caps rally in a massive sector rotation. $SPX/$NDX tanks. Next week:  1T outflows. Then they pump and dump the russel up 12% to 2022 highs and then sell off for a quick 6% while everyones FOMOing into $RUT. Maybe more like RUT RO!!!! I Fomo'd last of dry powder MOnday but after earnings I'm turning bearish.  Tomorrow 5k realized loss for me or hold to 0.\n\nToo hard to beat the street. Profit taking, buying million dollar real estate with cash like smart investors do. Sit on the sidelines and let it bleed. But here we are still FOMO'ing calls and short dated puts that would only print 1/1000 times.\n\nOver the past few days 3 mag 7 earnings all tanked and here we are.\n\nAMD? CPUs Good for gamers and graphics cards for poors. Pennies compared to $NVDA. $NVDA has a monopoly on AI software like $ASML has a monopoly on lithography and $TSM has a monopoly on chip production.  $TSLA obviously seemingly doomed. Google can't take your cookies anymore, advertising revenue down MoM. Wanna get cucked by the zuck?  I'm tempted to donate $1 to people wanting to buy $META calls at this point.\n\nTLDR: This looks like the same pattern we have had in 2022 and 2023 when markets take a downturn through mid-late October.   Look at the previous years. I posted last week about the last 4 septembers being red. It looks like we are in another downturn. Earnings indicates it. I don't think CPI and PCE will save us this week.\n\nI'm scrounging up 25k waiting for the correction / dip / crash and buying SHARES so i never waste so much of my lifetime just to lose money speculating with options. Will post my realized losses if you think I'm BS.\n\nThanks for reading this or just the TLDR. Looking forward to discussion!",

Margins are getting squeezed by tariffs, and the market doesn't care about the long-term outlook, just immediate profits.

Those moves felt smart a few months ago.  \n\nI know people are bailing on healthcare and piling into tech now... same thing happened in reverse during April lows. The cycle is just... exhausting.

    "title": "EURUSD falls to lowest since early July What does this mean for equities and macro?",
    "selftext": "With the recent macro situation, this could have a knock-on effect on equities and risk assets:\n\nThis morning, the EURUSD fell to its lowest since early July and is currently hovering around 1.0800. That's not a small drop, and a few days ago we were near the top of 1.09.\n\nThere are probably a few reasons at the heart of this decline: \n\nUS economic data was too strong \n\nQ2 GDP was revised upwards to 2.8% (previously 2.3%).\n\nCore PCE (the Fed's most watched inflation indicator) was higher than expected.\n\nThese data strengthened the market's expectations that the Fed will \u201ckeep interest rates high for longer\u201d and made the dollar stronger.\n\nECB releases dovish signals \n\nEurozone inflation data showed some easing.\n\nGermany's latest PMI data is very weak, recession fears are rising again.\n\nSome ECB officials are starting to sound cautious, and the market expects that rate cuts could start in early 2026 (and there are even suggestions that they could be possible by the end of 2025).\n\nSafe-haven capital is pouring into the dollar \n\nGeopolitical situations are heating up (e.g. Ukraine, global trade tensions), allowing the dollar to attract a lot of capital as a safe-haven asset.\n\nMeanwhile, U.S. bond yields remain firm 10-year U.S. bonds are close to 4.3%.\n\nWhat does this mean for the markets?\n\nLarge tech stocks and those companies that are heavily influenced by the dollar (e.g., $AAPL, $MSFT, $META) could be under pressure, especially since a good portion of their revenue comes from Europe.\n\nMultinationals (e.g., $PG, $KO, $JNJ) could take a loss in Q3 earnings due to exchange rate losses.\n\nEurozone stocks (which can be followed via the $EZU or $FEZ ETFs) could be pressured by economic weakness, but a weak euro favors German exporters, such as automakers.\n\nDollar-denominated commodities (e.g., gold, crude oil) could come under pressure in the short term due to a stronger dollar, unless macro risks push up safe-haven demand, such as gold.\n\nMy take?\n\nShort-term weakness in the euro is justified, but the next thing to watch is whether US inflation continues to \u201cstick\u201d, and the Fed's attitude at its annual meeting in Jackson Hole at the end of August. If Powell is hawkish again, we could see EUR/USD fall to 1.07 or even 1.06.\n\nIs anyone hedging their exchange rate risk with forex manipulation, long DXY (dollar index) options, or in company earnings reports? Would love to hear how people are laying it out.",

But if it is ruled that the President does NOT legally have such authority, the impact might be very significant for many companies.   \nIn that event, which stocks would you expect to benefit the most?   \nI own AAPL and assume that it would react positively.

    "selftext": "This is a daily watchlist for short-term trading: I might trade all/none of the stocks listed, and even stocks not listed! I am targeting potentially good candidates for short-term trading; I have no opinion on them as investments. The potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting, everything else is secondary.\n\nNews: [US CPI Report For June](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/live-blog/2025-07-15/us-cpi-report-for-june?srnd=homepage-americas)\n\n[**NVDA (NVIDIA)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&p=d)/AMD- NVDA/AMD is now allowed to sell its previously restricted H20/MI308 chips to China after gaining U.S. government approval. This reopens a major demand pipeline and removes a significant geopolitical overhang, boosting investor sentiment around long-term growth prospects. NVDA has hit ATH from this, I'm more interested in AMD today as a trade though just because it's run down compared to NVDA, but I'm interested in seeing if NVDA can break $170. The export clearance marks a shift in U.S. posture toward China and semiconductors and the AI race, suggesting trade tensions are entering a more flexible phase and all that money Jensen \"donated\" to Trump is paying off. This benefits high-end chipmakers, namely AMD/NVDA the most.\n\n[**BABA (Alibaba)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=BABA&p=d)/KC/FXI/all Chinese stocks- The chip export announcement has been interpreted as Trump easing his stance on China, sparking a rally across most Chinese equities. BABA was up nearly 6% premarket, and I'm mainly interested in seeing if we can break daily highs in BABA today, other than that I'm also watching KC, a Chinese datacenter stock. Main risk is that Trump reverses his stance- the TACO trade can cut both ways.\n\n[**MP (MP Materials)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=MP&p=d)\\- The Department of Defense agreed to buy $400M in MP's newly issued preferred stock, taking a 15% stake in the company last week. AAPL is expected to announce a $500M commitment to MP, signaling \"deepening partnerships to localize critical rare-earth supply chains\" (this was announced on FOX news). I doubt this will make as big a spike as the DOD investment because we're so far up already, so not too interested in this stock today, but still worth writing about.",

    "selftext": "US stock futures fell Sunday as President Trump and top administration officials suggested country-specific tariffs would take effect on Aug. 1, offering more potential confusion to trading partners but also potential breathing room for negotiations.\n\nFutures attached to the Dow Jones Industrial Average (YM=F), the S&P 500 (ES=F), and the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 (NQ=F) all dropped around 0.3%.\n\nTrump had targeted July 9 as a self-imposed deadline, when his \"pause\" on steep April tariffs would go back into effect. Global markets have been bracing for that potential shock, with the US only having reached deals with the UK and Vietnam, as well as a framework toward an agreement with China.\n\nBut on Sunday, both Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Trump suggested that while Trump could send out letters this week informing countries of their tariff rates, those duties would not go into effect until Aug. 1.\n\n\"President Trump's going to be sending letters to some of our trading partners saying that if you don't move things along, then on Aug. 1 you will boomerang back to your April 2 tariff level. So I think we're going to see a lot of deals very quickly,\" Bessent told CNN's \"State of Union.\"\n\nAAPL, DDOG, BGM, MDB, TEAM, and OKTA could benefit if progress on trade deals helps stabilize sentiment and supports a rebound in both large-cap tech and mid-cap growth names.\n\nBessent hinted at several possible deals in the coming days, suggesting the focus this week is clarity with 18 major trading partners before setting duties for the 100-plus other countries that the administration has in its sights for trade taxation. Wall Street is waiting to see how trade talks between the European Union and Canada go, in addition to other key partners.",

This just goes to show how much valuation and time matter. A great company can have a wildly inaccurate price and you are left with nothing while it grows into its valuation.\n\nAlso worth noting their revenue has been completely flat since reporting Q2 of 2023 while gross profit has fallen by ~20%. Their net earnings per share has collapsed 50% during this time.\n\nLots of the last 2 years have been when Musk was involved with his politics. Maybe he can turn it around now, but either way, the current valuation does not leave much room for any sort of stock price appreciation.

    "selftext": "Over the past few weeks, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq have been fluctuating repeatedly at high levels. Many friends have said, \"The direction is unclear and we dare not act.\" But in fact, the oscillation range is precisely when the low-risk strategy comes into play.\n\nRecently, I have been tracking a simplified version of a strategy that combines range-bound oscillation and breakout following. The core logic is:\n\nAfter determining the key support/resistance areas in major indices (such as $SPY / $QQQ) or large-cap stocks (such as $AAPL / $NVDA), observe the changes in trading volume and K-line structure.\n\nPlace an observation order near the upper edge of the range. Once the volume increases and breaks through, follow to open small positions. If there is a false breakout, the stop-loss is extremely small (usually less than 1%).\n\nAuxiliary indicators use simple moving averages (such as EMA20, EMA50) + RSI divergence to determine whether the breakout is healthy.\n\nLast week, I followed up with a small position using this framework when $NVDA broke through 1100, with a profit target in the 1150 range. The stop-loss is set below 1085, and the risk is very controllable.\n\nI wouldn't say this is a \"sure-win strategy\", but its advantage lies in:\n\nThe risk is low, the cost of making mistakes is low, and it does not rely on prediction but only on market signals. It is suitable for volatile markets and the initial trend formation stage\n\nWhich stock/index breakthrough opportunities have you been observing recently? Let's all discuss our ideas together \\~",

    "selftext": "Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSMC), the primary chip supplier to Nvidia (NVDA) and Apple (AAPL), reported a 39.6% year-over-year rise in May revenue as clients rushed to stockpile chips amid growing trade tensions.\n\nThe company generated NT$320.5 billion ($10.7 billion) in revenue last month. While this marks a strong annual increase, it's an 8.3% decline from April, when TSMC saw a sharper 48.1% year-over-year gain.\n\nRevenue for January through May 2025 totaled NT$1,509.34 billion, an increase of 42.6% compared to the same period in 2024.\n\nLooking ahead, analysts project a 50.3% Y/Y increase in TSMC's second-quarter sales, signaling continued robust demand despite month-over-month volatility.\n\nTSMC chief executive and Chairman C.C. Wei said last week that the demand for the company's AI chips continues to outweigh supply.\n\nThe chipmaker reported strong Q1 results in April and issued a positive outlook for the coming years. \"We continue to observe robust AI related demand from our customers throughout 2025. We reaffirm our revenue from AI accelerators to double in 2025,\" said Wei on the earnings call.",

    "title": "(06/10) IPO Movers and Rockets! Interesting Stocks Today",
    "selftext": "Hi! I am an ex-prop shop equity trader. This is a daily watchlist for short-term trading: I might trade all/none of the stocks listed, and even stocks not listed! I am targeting potentially good candidates for short-term trading; I have no opinion on them as investments. The potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting, everything else is secondary.\n\nNews: [Zuckerberg Recruits New Superintelligence AI Group At Meta](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-10/zuckerberg-recruits-new-superintelligence-ai-group-at-meta?srnd=homepage-americas)\n\n[**CRWV**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=CRWV&p=d)\\-DA Davidson released commentary suggesting their pro forma had underestimated its debt situation while not properly accounting for borrowing costs. This stock is ridiculously run up since IPO (\\~4x it's opening price). Daily setup doesn\u2019t look like a clean short, but watching to see if it mimics CRCL\u2019s recent surge at the open yesterday. Interested in seeing if it breaks the highs ($166). Obviously CRWV has a huge debt load due to their GPUs/training chips, but whether this will actually affect the stock price remains to be seen.\n\n[**TSLA**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TSLA&p=d)\\-Musk/Trump tensions have cooled down and Trump publicly stated that they will keep their White House Starlink. This happened about 30 mins before the close and caused TSLA to shoot up a little, and ASTS/RKLB to sell off. TSLA was extremely interesting the day of the feud, but currently I'm minorly long.\n\n[**ASTS**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=ASTS&p=d)**/**[**RKLB**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=RKLB&p=d)\\-Part of the broader spaceflight stock rally that began earlier this week, mainly due to Jeff Bezos implying a partnership through a picture with ASTS. Has been on a tear for the past 3 days, might have topped out yesterday. Wasn't this watching this too closely because I was trading CRCL but still interested to see if this makes a higher leg up. Yesterday was the most interesting day for this and RKLB, but if this breaks highs again today then I'll be interested.\n\n[**CRCL**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=CRCL&p=d)\\-Strong run post-IPO has made this the most interesting stock this week outside of TSLA. Very likely we topped out yesterday but watching for additional momentum. Keep in mind that this is mainly \"C\" money + the hype of a recent C stock and IPO success of CRWV that has propelled this higher (it is a solid business model as well)\\_. I think the momentum in this has deflated (we surged briefly off the open and then sold off for most of the day).\n\n[**AAPL**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AAPL&p=d)\\-Intraday selloff yesterday came as excitement over the \u201cLiquid Glass Design\u201d underwhelmed, revealing more of a UI update than hardware innovation. WWDC tends to be a \"sell-the-news\" event.\n\n**Earnings:** [**GME**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=GME&p=d), [**GTLB**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=GTLB&p=d)",

    "selftext": "No paywall: [https://www.investopedia.com/what-to-expect-in-markets-this-week-may-inflation-data-apple-conference-gamestop-earnings-11749224](https://www.investopedia.com/what-to-expect-in-markets-this-week-may-inflation-data-apple-conference-gamestop-earnings-11749224)\n\nNews from a tech giant, inflation data and earnings from a meme-stock legend are among the highlights of the week ahead in markets.\n\nApple's\u00a0annual Worldwide Developers Conference\u00a0opens the week with a keynote session from CEO Tim Cook scheduled for Monday. Cook will likely use the event to address the company's new products, services, and partnerships. GameStop could clarify its cryptocurrency strategy on the company's earnings call, set for Tuesday. Key companies in the growing\u00a0artificial intelligence (AI)\u00a0market are also scheduled to update investors on their financials during the week.\n\nA U.S. inflation report scheduled for Wednesday could indicate whether President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs are beginning to have an effect on the economy. The news follows a\u00a0healthy jobs report\u00a0Friday.\n\nAfter markets shook off trade tensions last week to bring the S&P 500\u00a0back above 6000, investors will keep an eye on tariffs as\u00a0Trump\u2019s deadline on trade deals approaches. At the same time, the Senate will continue to work toward passage of Trump\u2019s \u201cBig, Beautiful\u201d budget bill amid\u00a0increasing criticism\u00a0from Tesla CEO and\u00a0former Department of Government Efficiency Chief Elon Musk.\n\n# Economists Look for Inflation\u2019s Impact in May CPI Report\n\nWednesday\u2019s expected release of the\u00a0Consumer Price Index (CPI)\u00a0will be the first look at inflation from May. With a Federal Reserve meeting around the corner, the report could set the tone for the central bank as it faces pressure from Trump to lower interest rates. Fed officials are in their blackout period ahead of their next two-day meeting, which begins June 17.\n\nTrump\u2019s tariffs\u00a0will be a key topic in Friday\u2019s consumer sentiment report, which dropped for four straight months before\u00a0leveling out in May. Consumers are\u00a0consistently worried\u00a0that tariffs will drive inflation higher, sending the closely watched survey to some of its lowest readings since the pandemic. As inflation has lately appeared in check, the freefall in sentiment may have hit bottom.\n\n# GameStop Reports As It Jumps into Bitcoin Market\n\nGameStop\u2019s (GME) earnings report comes as the video-game retailer dips its toe in the cryptocurrency pool. The company, which\u00a0fired up the meme stock craze\u00a0in 2021 with its meteoric rise, announced in late May that it\u00a0bought $500 million in bitcoin. With its\u00a0retail video game business in decline, GameStop looks to emulate the playbook of Michael Saylor\u2019s Strategy (MSTR) and other companies\u00a0centering their business models on buying bitcoin.\n\nAI will be a key theme in other corporate earnings this week. Oracle\u2019s (ORCL) report on Wednesday follows the January announcement that the database software firm would join ChatGPT maker OpenAI and\u00a0SoftBank\u00a0as part of a joint venture known as\u00a0Stargate\u00a0to build AI infrastructure. Adobe\u2019s (ADBE) report on Thursday is also expected to focus on the\u00a0company\u2019s sales of AI-enhanced graphics software.\n\n# This Week\u2019s Calendar\n\n**Monday, June 9**\n\n* Wholesale inventories (April)\n* Apple\u2019s (AAPL) WWDC conference begins with CEO Tim Cook's keynote address and special event\n* Key Earnings: Casey\u2019s General Stores (CASY)\n\n**Tuesday, June 10**\n\n* NFIB Small Business Optimism Index (May)\n* Key Earnings: GameStop, J.M.

A favorable deal might give these companies the green light for continued business operations in China, potentially boosting their stock prices\n\nChinese consumer demand could get a significant boost especially for companies with exposure in the region like NKE or SBUX However if the deal falls short of expectations those stocks could take a hit \n\n Even though we\u2019re all hoping for a positive agreement the market could react negatively if the deal is underwhelming or doesn\u2019t address key issues like intellectual property or market access. In addition, this trade deal could bring forward inflation concerns if the economic impact is stronger than expected\n\nI'm personally looking at **tech** stocks next week If the deal brings positive sentiment I'm expecting a short-term rally in these sectors However I'm also hedging my bets with some **puts** on broader indices in case the deal disappoints and causes volatility\n\nAnyone else planning to make moves based on this Are there any specific stocks you think will get a major bump if the deal is good",

    "selftext": "Apple\u2019s big developer conference kicks off June 9, and Wall Street is *watching closely* \u2014 especially with the AI hype still going strong.\n\nLast year, Apple teased us with \u201cApple Intelligence,\u201d their own take on generative AI. Big demos, big promises... but not much follow-through. Siri still isn\u2019t GPT-level, and most of the AI features we *did* get have been kind of meh.\n\nSo what should we expect this year?\n\nHere\u2019s a quick rundown:\n\n iOS/macOS/iPadOS are getting a major design overhaul, reportedly inspired by the Vision Pro\u2019s visionOS. Mark Gurman says it\u2019s the biggest visual revamp since iOS 7.\n\n AI features in smaller doses  like an intelligent battery manager that learns your habits, and live translation for AirPods (finally catching up to Google). But don\u2019t expect ChatGPT-style magic just yet.\n\n Apple might open its own LLMs to devs, allowing on-device AI apps. That could be a big deal long-term if devs jump in.\n\n New unified gaming app  looks like Apple wants to get serious about gaming. Still miles away from console-level stuff, but their App Store is already a mobile gaming monster.\n\nAlso, the iPhone 17 is rumored to be thinner and lighter**,** and paired with the new OS could help reignite sales in China  where Apple\u2019s been struggling for a few quarters now.\n\nBottom line: Apple might not blow minds like last year, but if the software updates are slick enough and the AI stuff feels *usable*, it could be enough to get AAPL back in the good graces of investors.",

Have insurance companies, contrarian bets, mix of mid cap growth companies which have proven themselves with continuously strong earnings reports, and few crazy growth stories.\n\n**The Rules**: DCA daily, when fear and greed index dumps below 25 then aggressively DCA even lump sum. If a company has more than 2 bad earnings more-so guidance than they're out.\n\n**Good Time To Buy?**: I believe they're all overpriced right now. Will hedge with UVXY calls buying monthlies, selling against the position creating diagonals at various strikes when there's an upcoming binary event which could be negative catalyst.\n\n**Changes This Time**: Am combining timing the market increasing DCA'ing amounts, actively managing based off of ER's/guidance, and hedging against during drawdowns using longer dated uvxy calls.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite ( \\^IXIC ) was down about 0.6 percent.\n\nApple Inc (AAPL) must pay a 25 percent tariff on iPhones sold in the U.S. but not made in the U.S., Trump said on Friday, and all three major stock indexes trimmed their losses sharply. The tech giant has begun shifting some of its manufacturing operations to India, while China, home to its main suppliers, is mired in a trade war with the United States. Apple shares fell 3 percent after Trump's tweet on Truth Social.\n\nOn Friday afternoon, Trump hinted that the tariffs would apply to other cellphone makers.\n\nTrump told reporters Friday afternoon: \"The tariffs are going to be higher, and Samsung and any company that makes that product is going to be affected, or it's not fair. Again, they don't have tariffs on building factories here. That's why they'll build a factory here.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Trump has threatened to raise tariffs on EU imports \u201cright up to 50 percent\u201d as of June 1, as trade talks between China and Europe have stalled.",

    "selftext": "AAPL is the most interesting stock today.\n\n[**AAPL (Apple)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AAPL&p=d)\\-President Trump has threatened AAPL with a 25% tariff on iPhones not manufactured in the U.S., pressuring the company to shift production domestically. This announcement led to a 3.5% drop in Apple's stock and a broader market sell-off (followed shortly by his comments on Europe). Interested in a short if we break $193 at the open, otherwise more interested in the broad market ETFs. An iPhone made in the US is economically infeasible.\n\nHi! I am an ex-prop shop equity trader. This is a daily watchlist for short-term trading: I might trade all/none of the stocks listed, and even stocks not listed! I am targeting potentially good candidates for short-term trading; I have no opinion on them as investments. The potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting, everything else is secondary.\n\nNews: [Trump Rattles Markets With Fresh Tariff Threats on EU, Apple](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-23/trump-threatens-a-50-tariff-on-eu-goods-starting-in-june)\n\n[**QQQ**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=QQQ&p=d)/[**SPY**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SPY&p=d)/[**VXX**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=VXX&p=d)/[**UPRO**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=UPRO&p=d)\\-President Trump recommended a 50% tariff on European Union goods starting June 1, 2025, citing stalled trade negotiations. Interested in if we break $500 level in QQQ/new lows in the market ETFs. Currently long VXX. Here we go again! Escalation of trade tariffs are the main risk here, whether these will be repealed or not, VIX will probably increase over the next few days.\n\n[**BAH (Booz Allen Hamilton Holding)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=BAH&p=d)\\-BAH reported Q4 adjusted EPS of $1.61, meeting expectations, with revenue of $2.97B vs $3.02B. Provided FY26 guidance below consensus, projecting adjusted EPS of $6.20-$6.55 vs $6.87, and revenue of $12.0-$12.5B vs $12.8B exp. Overall they cited decreased US govt spending as the reason: they're 1/10 firms subject to a federal government \u201cconsultant spend review\u201d by cancelling or renegotiating contracts.\n\n[**MSTR (MicroStrategy)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=MSTR&p=d)\\-MSTR hit highs yesterday, driven by the underlying it's based on reaching an ATH. However, the stock and the underlying sold off mainly due to Trump comments. Pretty much moves with the underlying, currently trading at 1.74x multiple to the amount of C it holds. We're in a weird spot where the stock is \"historically\" at  a lower multiplier than usual but essentially near ATH. Possibly interested in a buy if we sell off hard today, otherwise more interested in the market stocks. ",

Raised full-year product revenue guidance to $4.33B vs. $4.29B exp. Q2 product revenue guidance of $1.035B\u2013$1.045B implies \\~25% growth (from a random SA article I read). Moved close to 20 points from yesterday, watching $200 level. The cloud computing space has essentially exploded due to the rise of AI, I should've seen SNOW would report good earnings mainly because of CRWV's earnings reporting 400% revenue growth. Random risks I'm thinking of in the long term are the stalling of semis production (and even the demand for it), regulatory actions like what happened to NVDA, competition in the data cloud market, etc.\n\n[**AAPL (Apple)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AAPL&p=d)\\-OpenAI announced the acquisition of Jony Ive's AI hardware startup for $6.4B. This is the first shot in what I consider the \"AI Consumer Hardware War\" (sorry Humane Pin, you don't count lol). This positions OpenAI to develop a new generation of AI-powered devices and could challenge Apple in the AI space. Stock fell intraday yesterday 2-3%, interested to see if we continue that selloff. Watching the 200 level as well. Apple has essentially fallen flat with AI (Apple Intelligence) and hasn't struck gold recently with any good hardware, we can safely consider the Apple Vision a bust.\n\n[**FICO (FICO)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=FICO&p=d)\\-FHFA director William J. Pulte called for the provider of credit scores to be more \"economical\" and that FHFA is considering replacing the tri-merge credit score model with a bi-merge system to cut costs. Already long from $1700 yesterday, we're down close to 30% on a remark that thinks a $1.50 increase in its wholesale royalty for mortgage originations is too high. The price change is $3.50 to $4.95 per score (which may lead to other companies raising their prices). This is my personal opinion- FICO's probably not going to be phased out for mortgages lol. Too many financial/credit institutions use it.\n\n[**CRWV (Coreweave)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=CRWV&p=d)\\-The stock has been on a monster run, and I'm interested in the short today. We've gone from \\~$50 to \\~$120 at the peak premarket, watching $100 level to see if we bounce off it or if we continue selling off. Most immediate risk I foresee is massive volatility; we're in speculation territory when it comes to this stock now.\n\n[**UNH (UnitedHealth)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=UNH&p=d)\\-Reports suggest the insurer made covert payments to nursing homes to limit hospital transfers, aiming to reduce costs, raising concerns over care practices. I won't include the context because I'm sure all of you are sick to death (this is a joke) of hearing about it from Reddit. Broke the $300 level again to the downside, interested to see if this will dump in the open and may try to play a small bounce in this. I exited my main position yesterday (thank god), but looking for other places to enter.\n\n**Earnings today:** [**INTU**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=INTU&p=d), [**WDAY**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=WDAY&p=d)\n\n**IPO Today:** HNGE",

That highlighted the way the Trump administration\u2019s tariffs campaign \u2014 peaking with 145% levies on Chinese goods \u2014 is disrupting tech supply chains and diverting electronics elsewhere.\n\nInvestors fear a global trade war that would erode some of the US-China bilateral trade that reached $690 billion in 2024, decimating industries and raising prices for consumers. Tensions remain high: Beijing this week accused the Trump administration of undermining recent trade talks in Geneva by pursuing sanctions on Huawei Technologies Co.\u2019s artificial intelligence chips.\n\nLast year, the three biggest US imports from China were smartphones, laptops and lithium-ion batteries, while liquid petroleum gas, oil, soybeans, gas turbines, and machines to make semiconductors were some of the most valuable US exports to China.\n\nThe value of phone component exports to India \u2014 home to Apple\u2019s biggest iPhone production base outside of China \u2014 roughly quadrupled over the course of the past year, according to China\u2019s General Administration of Customs.\n\nApple has accelerated a shift of production to India, though Trump recently criticized that practice and urged Apple to bring iPhone manufacturing home. The device has never been produced in the US, a project that appears unfeasible at least in the short run.",

I am targeting potentially good candidates for short-term trading; I have no opinion on them as investments. The potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting, everything else is secondary.\n\nI don't know how sustained today's move will be- we've made a massive move upwards, and even 30% tariffs will still reduce business with China by 70% in the medium term (\\~6 to 9 month timeframe)\n\nNews: [Us And China Agree To Major Reductions In Tariffs For 90 Days](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-12/us-and-china-agree-to-major-reductions-in-tariffs-for-90-days)\n\n[**AAPL (Apple)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AAPL&p=d) **/** [**AMZN (Amazon)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AMZN&p=d)\\- Both stocks are up \\~6% following announcement of a 90-day suspension of U.S.-China tariffs, reducing U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports from 145% to 30%. Watching $214/$215 in AAPL and seeing if we can make another move higher. Currently long. Obviously this is a 90-day suspension and not actually a guarantee that things will return back to normal. Everything in consumer disc is moving off this news. Risks I'm seeing from this are potential re-escalation of trade tensions and more supply chain disruptions, and I'm thinking of possibly flipping short if we make a massive move upwards.\n\n[**BABA (Alibaba)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=BABA&p=d) **/** [**JD (JD.com)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=JD&p=d)\\- Chinese tech stocks like BABA and JD are also major winners of tariffs, with both up roughly 6%, following the 90-day agreement. Watching $135 level (basically just seeing which Chinese stocks are close to breaking highs). Risks are the same as American stocks. Other notable stocks I like on this are BIDU/TCEHY (trades OTC)\n\n[**PFE (Pfizer)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=PFE&p=d) **/** [**MRK (Merck)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=MRK&p=d) **/** [**JNJ (Johnson & Johnson)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=JNJ&p=d)\\- Trump announced plans to sign an executive order implementing a \"most-favored-nation\" policy to reduce U.S. prescription drug prices by up to 59%. This policy aims to \"align\" U.S. drug prices with the lower prices paid by other countries. Obviously pretty terrible news for anyone investing in pharmaceutical stocks because it affects major revenue sources for this company. The US has limited direct negotiating and mainly relies on private pharmacy benefit managers to negotiate prices in insurance plans currently, which results in sky-high insurance costs. I'm Interested in MRK, we're already broken lows (even during the tariffs) because MRK is highly dependent on Medicare reimbursement (MRK).\n\n[**BP (BP)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=BP&p=d)\\- BP up on reports that several major oil companies, including Shell, Chevron, and ExxonMobil, are evaluating potential takeover bids. BP is considered undervalued, with a market cap of \u00a357B against asset valuations of \\~\u00a3120B. No levels I'm watching at this time. Notably, the last piece of meaningful news on this that I remember was Eliot Management taking a stake, so it pushes the likelihood that they're getting acquired up incrementally.",

Earnings are today and will likely make or break the move; I was mainly interested in a short opportunity but with the defense spending proposal my plans are toast. Likely will trade earnings. $125 is the ATH and we broke that this morning, interested to see if we can hold that at the open. Short biased, but PLTR has had such a steady-strong move that I'm very handsoff unless we do something crazy like jump to $130 during regular trading hours. \n\n[**AAPL (Apple)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AAPL&p=d)\\- Reported somewhat disappointing earnings on Thursday mainly due to uncertainty from tariffs, interested to see if it can continue momentum to the downside. Interested primarily in the $200 level, we've been selling off for the past 4 days and have had a slow decline due to earnings. AAPL is the most heavily affected company from tariffs, and the longer they go on the worse  it gets for consumer companies. Currently long but will bail if we break $200 today. \n\n[**NFLX (Netflix)/DIS (Disney)/CMCSA (Comcast)/WBD (Warner Bros.)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NFLX&p=d)\\- Trump orders 100% tariff on foreign-made movies, escalating trade tensions and potentially disrupting global media revenue streams. This is a material policy shift that could affect distribution costs and reshape content strategies. Primarily interested in NFLX despite the high price of the stock, they moved the most (5% at time of writing) and do most of their filming overseas to save on costs. Most streaming services struggle with the costs of movies exploding over the years, this cuts into profitability as well. Retaliatory tariffs from other countries and disrupted international partnerships pose downside risks. A prolonged policy could lead to margin compression across the sector.\n\n[**NNI (Navient)/MMS (Maximus)/SOFI (SoFi)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NNI&p=d)\\- Student loan collections begin today since the pause happened during COVID. This could drive momentum in loan servicers. Oddly enough, I haven't seen much movement in loan collections stocks- but I do expect them to move when the surges of loans come in. There's still macro overhang that could affect these companies in the longer term (months) if we do go into an economic recession. Mainly watching for any news of loan pauses (which I think are unlikely).\n\nEarnings: PLTR/HIMS/F",

    "selftext": "Apple\u00a0reported second fiscal-quarter earnings Thursday that beat Wall Street expectations, but the company\u2019s closely-watched Services division came up light versus estimates. \u00a0\n\nHere\u2019s how Apple did versus consensus estimates for the quarter ending in March:\u00a0\n\n* EPS $1.65 vs. $1.63 estimated by LSEG\u00a0\n\n* Revenue: $95.4 billion vs. $94.66 billion estimated by LSEG\u00a0\n\n* iPhone revenue: $46.84 billion vs. $45.84 billion estimated, per StreetAccount\u00a0\n\n* Mac revenue: $7.95 billion vs. $7.77 billion estimated, per StreetAccount \u00a0\n\n* iPad revenue: $6.4 billion vs. $6.20 billion estimated, per StreetAccount\u00a0\n\n* Wearables, Home, and Accessories revenue: $7.52 billion vs. $7.95 billion, per StreetAccount\u00a0\n\n* Services revenue: $26.65 billion vs. $26.70 billion, per StreetAccount\u00a0\n\n* Gross margin: 41.7% vs. 47.1%, per StreetAccount\u00a0\n\nThe company reported $1.65\u00a0per share on $24.78 billion\u00a0of net income during the quarter, versus $23.64 billion, or $1.53 per share, in the year-ago period.\u00a0\n\nApple typically provides data points about how it sees the current quarter shaping up on a call with analysts. Wall Street is highly anticipating CEO Tim Cook\u2019s first public comments on how Apple will navigate rapidly-shifting tariffs proposed by the Trump administration.\u00a0\n\nAnalysts are looking for third-quarter guidance of $1.48 in earnings per share on $89.45 billion of sales.\u00a0\n\nCook told CNBC that Apple is already sourcing about half of the iPhones for the U.S. from India, and most of its other products for the U.S. from Vietnam, where tariffs are lower than they are from China. Apple still makes the \u201cvast majority\u201d of its products for other countries from China, Cook said. \u00a0\n\n\u201cIf you look at the U.S., over half of the U.S. sales of iPhone come from India,\u201d Cook said. \u201cIf you look at the other products, Mac and iPad and AirPods and the Watch, almost all of the country of origin is Vietnam.\u201d\u00a0\n\nCook said the iPhone uses a lot of chips made domestically, and that Apple is buying 19 billion chips this year from the U.S. \u00a0\n\n\u201cWith an iPhone, you really have to go a step lower and look at the individual parts and where they come from,\u201d he said. \u00a0\n\nApple said its board authorized up to $100 billion in share repurchases this quarter, down from $110 billion in authorization last year. Apple also said it would pay a dividend of 26 cents per share, a 4% increase.\u00a0\n\n\u201cWe continue to plan for annual dividend increases,\u201d Cook said. \u00a0\n\nThe company\u2019s most important product line, iPhones, topped estimates at $46.8 billion in sales during the quarter. The overall product line\u2019s sales were up just under 2% on an annual basis. \u00a0\n\nApple\u2019s profitable Services division includes iCloud subscriptions, services like Apple Music and Apple TV+, warranties and revenue from search licensing deals like its agreement with Google. \u00a0\n\nCook, in a statement, hailed \u201cdouble-digit\u201d Services growth to $26.65 billion in revenue during the quarter, an annual increase of 11.65%. However, Services revenue came in slightly under StreetAccount expectations, and last year, Apple\u2019s services division grew 14.2% during the March quarter. \u00a0\n\nApple hardware generally did well during the quarter.\u00a0\n\nMac sales rose nearly 7% to just under $8 billion, and iPad sales were up 15% on an annual basis to $6.4 billion. Apple introduced new mid-priced iPad Air and MacBook Air models in March. \u00a0\n\nHowever, Apple\u2019s wearables division, which includes Apple Watch, AirPods and accessories sales, declined 5% versus the same period last year to $7.52 billion in revenue. \n\nSales in Greater China, which includes Taiwan and Hong Kong, were down slightly year-over-year at $16 billion. Cook said that China sales were accelerating on a quarterly basis, and that Apple sales in the region would have been flat if not for foreign exchange rates. \u00a0\n\nOn the other hand, sales in the Americas, Apple\u2019s largest market that has seen some increased consumer demand ahead of tariffs, rose nearly 8%. Cook told CNBC\u2019s Steve Kovach that Apple had not seen evidence of order \u201cpull forward\u201d because of tariffs. \u00a0\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t believe that there was a significant pull forward due to tariffs into the March quarter,\u201d Cook said. \u201cThere\u2019s no obvious evidence of it.\u201d\u00a0\n\nSource: [https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/01/apple-aapl-earnings-report-q2-2025-.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/01/apple-aapl-earnings-report-q2-2025-.html)",

I personally had the bias that it would actually be bullish for the company, so I'll likely trade a second move rather than the first if I'm at the computer for the trade. Moved down to around 270 overnight, will watch for additional confirmation. As most of you know, Musk's political involvement has made him controversial, and by extension, TSLA as well.\n\n[**RBLX (Roblox)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=RBLX&p=d)\\- Reported Q1 results with a loss of $0.32 per share vs. $0.40 expected and bookings of $1.21B vs. $1.14B expected.

No new risks beyond whatever has been said before (slower user growth, regulatory risks, platform outages, problems with minors, etc).

Capex surged to $16.75B, up 53% YoY, as it ramps up AI infrastructure, noting expected AI capacity constraints beyond June. Interested in seeing if it holds above $430 at market open. Its outsized AI investment was of huge interest to me- this moved a lot of Mag 7 names higher, especially NVDA. It signaled that there's still room for growth for these chip-makers. Companies that rent out computing space such as CRWV also moved higher on this as well. (It signals that they'll do better on earnings). \n\n[**META (Meta)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=META&p=d)\\- Reported stronger-than-expected Q1 revenue; Q2 sales guided to $42.5B\u2013$45.5B.

    "selftext": "Stocks closed mixed on Monday but recovered from sharp losses to begin a big week of heavyweight earnings reports and macroeconomic data that will continue to paint an early picture of the US economy's response to President Trump's tariffs.\n\nThe S&P 500 (^GSPC) erased losses of as much as 1% to rise just above the flatline. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) edged up 0.3%, notching its longest win streak of 2025. Both indexes ended in positive territory for the fifth straight day.\n\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) fell below the flatline, as shares of Big Tech recovered from steep early-session losses.\n\nWall Street is coming off a rebounding run last week. The gains came as Trump eased pressure on Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, and hinted at light at the end of the tunnel for sky-high 145% tariffs on China. On Monday, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said it was \"up to China\" to deescalate the trade battle, though he suggested its recent moves to exempt certain US goods from duties represented a positive step.\n\nEarnings are the highlight of the week ahead, with 180 S&P 500 companies expected to report quarterly financial results. Big Tech leads the way, as Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and Microsoft (MSFT) are all due in the coming days, alongside Coca-Cola (KO), Eli Lilly (LLY), and Chevron (CVX).\n\nBroader economic news will flavor the coming days, as investors eye Wednesday's release of the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, the Personal Consumer Expenditures (PCE) index, to see the impact of tariffs on the general public's \"core\" expenses. An initial reading on first quarter US GDP is also due Wednesday.\n\nThe April jobs report is also in sight, as the labor market has so far remained resistant to signs of economic slowdown.\n\nSource: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/live/stock-market-today-dow-sp-500-erase-slide-to-rise-for-5th-straight-day-in-lead-up-to-big-tech-earnings-200136533.html",

Economists expect the US economy added 133,000 nonfarm payroll jobs last month, with the unemployment rate remaining at 4.2%.\n\nThe most critical reading may be the non-farm payrolls report on Friday, as the market expects an addition of about 125K jobs.\n\nThe goldilocks read may be around 100-150K jobs. We don't want a number that is too strong, as it would likely decrease the probabilities for future rate cuts.

    "selftext": "Hi! I am an ex-prop shop equity trader. This is a daily watchlist for short-term trading: I might trade all/none of the stocks listed, and even stocks not listed! I am targeting potentially good candidates for short-term trading; I have no opinion on them as investments. The potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting, everything else is secondary.\n\nNews: [Trump Says He'll Be Very Nice To China In Trade Talks](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-23/trump-says-he-ll-be-very-nice-to-china-in-trade-talks)\n\n[**TSLA (Tesla)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TSLA&p=d)\\- Reported Q1 earnings with EPS of $0.27 vs. $0.39 expected and revenue of $19.34B vs. $21.11B expected. Total revenue declined 9% year-over-year, with automotive revenue dropping 20% to $14B. Net income fell 71% to $409M, or $0.12 per share. The company attributed the decline to factory retooling for the refreshed Model Y, lower average selling prices, and increased sales incentives. That was a brutal earnings report, yet Trump announcing that he'll be nice to China saved the stock and pushed the entire market up. Interested in $275 and $250 levels.\n\n[**SPY**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SPY&p=d) **/** [**QQQ**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=QQQ&p=d) **/** [**VXX**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=VXX&p=d) **/ China Stocks** / **Tech Stocks**\\- President Trump signaled a potential substantial reduction in China tariffs, which currently stand at 145%. Whether this will actually hold and be his stance going forward is entirely up to him (he changed his mind a lot during 2019's trade wars). Assuming that the market holds up today, I'm primarily watching my current positions in NVDA/AAPL and ready to flip short if we make some ridiculously unsustainable move or if Trump changes his mind.\n\n[**LLY (Eli Lilly)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=LLY&p=d)\\-Filed lawsuits against four telehealth companies for selling unauthorized compounded versions of its GLP-1 drugs, Mounjaro and Zepbound. (LLY's diabetes drug Mounjaro went into short supply in 2022, allowing pharmacies and outsourcing facilities to produce the treatment, a practice called compounding). These drugs generated over $16.4B in revenue last year. Interestingly enough I see this case as pretty major despite not moving the stock significantly today, deciding whether GLP-1 is essentialy \"genericized\" to the point where any company can sell it or only the original developers of the drug. NVO might face the same thing in the future. If LLY loses, that's a huge blow for both of them.\n\n[**HTZ (Hertz)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=HTZ&p=d)\\-The potential rollback of tariffs by the Trump administration could negatively impact Ackman's thesis that used cars are more valuable due to tariffs. The stock is nearing $9, the previous high when the tariff news was announced. I'm interested in shorting the stock if we make a parabolic move up or if we fail to break $9 (but as always, it's dependent on how we get there). Automotive rental companies have benefited from higher used car values amid tariff-induced supply constraints. \n\n**Earnings today:** IBM",

    "title": "This market is really not behaving well. Where do we most likely go from here?",
    "selftext": "I think traders and close market analysts realize this more than many people do. From a technical standpoint of course, but a fundamental one.\nFundamental I mean - The concerns that the market was overvalued in the first place... And that trump was going to drop a bomb on the market and dollar itself in some way, shape or form. The foregone conclusion by MSM when the bearish market began in early March that it was just tariffs and trump, or \"still a bull market\" as portrayed by cnbc and then by more MSM once we dropped more than 5 percent. The fact more people than now rely more on retirement appreciation - many times a sign of or near a market top. The talk of depression, parallels to Hoover, Smoot - Hawley, etc. I seriously doubt I honestly was the only one who had my strongest worries since when covid was emerging (but this time feels worse...)\n\nSome concerning features to me are the number of new investors /traders who keep thinking 2020 and 2022 bottoms were like this and now more than ever I'm hearing (accurately ) big drops feel scary, and they always recover. They don't have to always, it's just that they recently have. \n\nSo yeah, I guess that's the question. I don't have a crystal ball of where we are going, but where is it most likely to go? The price action last week was fairly flat-for this market. (down 8 pts on SPY) , but felt genuinely mostly worse than that. Worse case-I fear there will be an added crisis fueled by Trump in the near term or something else internal/ external but important - causing a severe down leg once again. Perhaps that could be poor earnings next week with added economic concerns, Trump firing powell and wrecking the dollar and markets more, or more countries forming \"anti USA\" trade alliances. Best case? Do we move flat in a kangaroo market? Is there significant upside potential if strong earnings come in? I've asked myself the last question a lot, and normally I'd say yes, but now I doubt that, or that the risk/reward will be skewed severely to the downside.\n\nThis is kind of the first generalized thing I've felt I could say with any degree of confidence in a while. I could look like a stupid fool a year from now, but maybe not. \n\nHere's what I've done that's not in any way trading related.  I'm adding to foreign businesses and bonds. For a larger non trading account that can't take heavy risk, that's not my own per se we bought German bonds and more Nokia stock. The bonds are up 5 percent due to the euro, and Nokia is flat. I like Nokia's business as they are not exposed to the tariff nonsense and have big contracts to provide 4g in developing countries still on older networks. This is huge business for them. I'm keeping the Berkshire position, I added to it last year, although I'm a bit surprised by its resilience so far, though I also kept Google (it's doing much worse than I would've expected) but sold two other tech stocks, aapl and Msft. Sold apple when I realized how much Berkshire itself had dumped of apple. Sold Msft because comparably it seemed more expensive and vulnerable in this downturn I thought was likely.\n\n\n\nThere's a school of thought that says \"markets aren't supposed to make us always feel comfortable\" and that this is why long term holders, ten or more years, will \"always\" or almost always be rewarded as a result. That's generally, but not always been accurate for the past 50 years.\nAnother consideration:what do you personally feel most of the public feels who have moderate stock exposure? I'm talking like portfolios of $50,000-$500,000. Some of these people may not pay attention to the markets much, but would be overly concerned of a significant market drop. They may just own etfs, or general retail investors. I personally feel many of these people are not overly concerned right now. ",

    "selftext": "Hi! I am an ex-prop shop equity trader. This is a daily watchlist for short-term trading: I might trade all/none of the stocks listed, and even stocks not listed! I am targeting potentially good candidates for short-term trading; I have no opinion on them as investments. The potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting, everything else is secondary.\n\nBack to the regularly scheduled programming.\n\nNews: [China Tells Airlines Stop Taking Boeing Jets As Trump Tariffs Expand Trade War](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-15/china-tells-airlines-stop-taking-boeing-jets-as-trump-tariffs-expand-trade-war)\n\n[**MP (MP Materials)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=MP&p=d)\\- Trump is preparing an executive order to establish a U.S. strategic reserve of critical rare earth minerals and metals, aiming to reduce U.S. dependence on China, which has recently halted exports of seven rare earth elements to the U.S. in response to trade tensions. Interested in MP's $30 level. Rare earth metals are important because they're used in technology, electronics, defense, and literally everything with a computer, with China controlling over 80% of all REMs. It is noteworthy that China entirely refines these metals and produces 90% of the global supply of these magnets. We're back in BLOPS2 baby! \n\n[**BA (Boeing)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=BA&p=d)\\-China has ordered its airlines to suspend deliveries of Boeing jets and halt purchases of aircraft-related equipment and parts from U.S. companies, a direct response to the U.S. imposing tariffs as high as 145% on Chinese goods. Interested in the $150 level. China is a significant market for BA, accounting for a substantial portion (20%!) of its projected deliveries over the next two decades. Despite being far smaller in comparison to Airbus, BA's planes are reserved years in advance, making it difficult for China to avoid using U.S. planes.\n\n[**BULL (Webull Corporation)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=BULL&p=d)\\-Webull Corporation completed a reverse merger with SK Growth Opportunities Corporation and is finally listed after delaying their IPO for years. Overall not interested in this unless we break yesterday's highs, as the price 8x'ing seems ludicrous for a company that should be priced relatively easily (because we have comparables such as HOOD/other brokerages). I'm biased negatively on this stock today.\n\n[**NVDA (Nvidia)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&p=d)\\-Nvidia has announced plans to invest up to $500B in building AI supercomputers entirely in the United States. This initiative includes establishing over a million square feet of manufacturing space in Texas, partnering with companies like Foxconn and Wistron. This seems like a play to avoid getting semis tariffed, although the outcome is uncertain, especially with Trump announcing upcoming tariffs in a month or two. Overall see a lot more uncertainty in this stock and AAPL, so extremely important to be aware of the tariff narrative.\n\n**E**arnings: IBKR/UAL",

The announcement actually happens, prompting even more retail investors to buy any large cap stock that sounds reliable (despite having done no prior analysis or thinking).  This drives up prices even higher.\n4. Short sellers begin exiting their positions and buying more, driving up prices on everything, including those that would be expected to continue losing amid the China tariffs, such as AAPL.\n5.

Short sellers lost their collective asses yesterday.  It was still a massive loss for investors overall.\n\nMy opinion (not financial advice): I'd be selling any position I didn't enter for the long term and exiting this market until calmer seas prevail.

I am targeting potentially good candidates for short-term trading; I have no opinion on them as investments.

The tariff escalation adds further pressure- Apple has flown literal planeloads of iPhones out of China but that's obviously a stop-gap measure. We've seen AAPL fall to $169, massively beyond what I could have even hoped. Still flat this but probably the #1 play if expecting a tariff reversal- the White House and Trump have signaled that tariffs are here to stay. Currently long a little from $170, but will bail if we hit those prices premarket/at the open.  \n\n**Related Tickers:** AVGO, QCOM, SWKS (all iPhone part manufacturers)\n\n[**WMT (Walmart)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=WMT&p=d), [**TGT (Target)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TGT&p=d)\\-WMT scraps quarterly operating income forecast, citing Trump\u2019s tariffs. They did cite net sales growing 3-4% this year. WMT backing away from guidance signals the \"we are in danger\" alarm over tariff impact on import costs and consumer demand even with net sales growing. TGT, with similar exposure, is likely to experience margin pressure in coming quarters. Margins are squeezed massively (and retailers are likely to take a loss on some goods simply because it's untenable to continue selling for a loss). \n\n[**DAL (Delta)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=DAL&p=d)\\- CEO states Trump tariffs are hurting bookings, and was unable to reaffirm guidance. Forecasted Q2 EPS of $1.70\u2013$2.30 vs. $2.23 est. Revenue to range -2% - +2% YoY vs. +1.9% est. Tariff fears hitting forward travel demand are a red flag, especially international bookings. Airlines face multiple macro pressures\u2014tariffs, softening travel sentiment, currency exchange fluctuations, etc, overall a different set of circumstances from COVID yet as deadly. \n\n[**TLT (iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TLT&p=d)\\-Massive afterhours move as China sells U.S. Treasuries, resulting in a 5 point move afterhours. Bloomberg is also citing an unwind of popular hedge fund trade. The scale and consistency of the move suggest a structural shift, not just positioning. Treasury market dislocation is raising systemic risk signals across asset classes. I think we've hit roughly \\~5% for the 20 year which is a big deal- China dumping treasuries means that yields go up but exacerbate inflation in the short term, and add to volatility.\n\n[**HUM (Humana)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=HUM&p=d), [**CVS (CVS Health)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=CVS&p=d), [**UNH (UnitedHealth Group)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=UNH&p=d)\\-Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services announced higher-than-expected Medicare Advantage payment rate increases for 2026. The unexpected increase in reimbursement rates is a huge tailwind for these providers, improving profit outlooks into 2026. We saw a spike in these health insurance names and subsequent selloff, interested in seeing if we make any sort of upward move today. (Addendum: Trump announced that pharma tariffs are also incoming, which may be the reason why we saw so many of these pull back). \n\n[**VXX (Volatility Index)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=VXX&p=d)/[**UVXY (ProShares Ultra VIX Short-Term Futures ETF)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=UVXY&p=d)/[**SVIX (Short VIX)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SVIX&p=d)\\-Volatility spike continues, but might be moving to shorting calls rather than shorting shares due to short locate issues.

    "selftext": "Hi! I am an ex-prop shop equity trader. This is a daily watchlist for short-term trading: I might trade all/none of the stocks listed, and even stocks not listed! I am targeting potentially good candidates for short-term trading; I have no opinion on them as investments. The potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting, everything else is secondary.\n\n**China announced a 34% tariff on the US. The US may retaliate. \"Reciprocal\" tariffs can result in a positive feedback loop of the tariff percentage.**\n\nNews: [China Imposes 34 Tariffs On All Us Imports As Retaliation](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-04/china-imposes-34-tariffs-on-all-us-imports-as-retaliation)\n\n**AVGO, NXPI, LRCX, AMAT- ALL OF THESE COMPANIES HAVE 20%+ OF THEIR SALES COME FROM CHINA)**\\- China imposing a 34% tariff on US imports escalates trade tensions and impacts supply chains, all of which have significant exposure to China. Overall, most interested in NVDA at $95/$90 and possibly INTC at $20 if we don't spike off the open. I'm leaning more bearish for today due to the news being announced so early premarket from China, and also from the fear of the US announcing additional tariffs.\n\n[**AAPL (Apple)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AAPL&p=d)\\- AAPL broke $200 premarket following the announcement- mainly due to approximately 20% of AAPL revenue comingfrom China. I'm interested mainly if it breaks $190 intraday. AAPL relies heavily on China for manufacturing, with over 90% of its production based there and newly imposed tariffs are expected to increase AAPL\u2019s annual costs by $8.5B. China adding more tariffs affects AAPL as it is clearly the biggest MAG7 loser of the tariffs. Main risks involve increased production costs, potential price hikes for consumers, and a possible decline in sales volume because our damn phones get far more expensive. Additionally, further escalation in trade tensions could lead to more severe supply chain disruptions. \n\n[**VXX (VIX Short-Term Futures ETN)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=VXX&p=d)\\- I still don't think we've peaked (as I mentioned yesterday). We've spiked to \\~$40 on the VIX ($75 on VXX). I'm interested in seeing how the US will respond to China tariffs before making any significant trades. The risk in the VXX short is based on overnight headlines from China announcing more tariffs (which already happened), and now, waiting for the US to retaliate. Fun.\n\n[**BABA (Alibaba)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=BABA&p=d)**,** [**FXI (China Large-Cap ETF)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=FXI&p=d)**,** [**YINN (China Bull 3X Shares)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=YINN&p=d)**,** [**YANG (China Bear 3X Shares)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=YANG&p=d)**,** [**JD (JD.com)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=JD&p=d)\\- China-related stocks are selling off due to expectations of retaliation from the US. Also currently just a \"watch\", everything hinges on if the US backs off from tariffs or if we escalate. Interested in BABA if it hits $100. If the US announces escalation of tariffs, I'm mainly interested in a YANG buy. This is potentially the largest catalyst since COVID, so one tweet can move the market.\n\nPlease remember YINN/YANG are not meant to be held intraday.",

    "selftext": "Yesterday many were confused about how did the government came with such numbers, which were too high for some countries (vietnam), cause this numbers made no sense taking into account current tariffs, some were thinking it was weight based taking into account most traded products or if currency change had something to do with it.\n\nBut the reality was much simpler:\n\nThis is how it was calculated:\n\n\\- They just took the total exports and imports with x country and thats it\n\nExample:\n\n\\- China: \n\nU.S. Imports from China: The United States imported goods worth $438.9 billion from China in 2024.\n\nU.S. Exports to China: The United States exported goods worth $143.5 billion to China in 2024.\n\n(439-143.5)/439=67%\n\n\\- Vietnam:\n\n(136.6-13)/136.6=90%\n\n\\- Japan:\n\n(148.2-80)/148.2=46%\n\n\\- India:\n\n(87.4-41.8)/87.4=52%\n\nNow what does that tells you? \n\n1.- The reciprocal tariffs or the half vs what they calculated is way too high cause it doesn't reflect the real tariffs\n\n2.- the 10% tariffs will likely wont get moved no matter what x country does (argentina etc), all the countries that import more from usa got the 10% tariff.\n\n3.- Whats the goal of giving such high tariffs? \n\n\\- You can speculate and reach a conclusion on your own, my bet is that they want 2 things:\n\n1: they want the x country to lower some tariffs on some USA products\n\n2: they want billions of investments to USA, like how certain companies already are doing, like aapl, honda, softbank, etc. \n\nWith this Info now you can speculate how things will get worse or better, but the key here is the situation with the key countries, Japan, China, EU, Mexico, vietnam, etc. ",

The largest risk, according to analysts, centers on the iPhone maker's overseas production hubs, which are particularly vulnerable to the tariffed countries.\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump announced tariffs that will impact some 185 countries, including the United States's largest trading partners. Additional reciprocal tariffs, for instance, will include 34% tariffs on Chinese imports, a 20% tariff on European Union imports, a 46% tariff on imports from Vietnam, 32% on imports from Taiwan, and 26% on India \u2014 all set to take effect on April 9.\n\nNotably, the additional 34% tax on China will be added to the country's existing 20% tariff, meaning its total tariff rate will rise to 54%. China is Apple's most important\u00a0[production hub](https://www.businessinsider.com/tim-cook-apple-supply-chain-trump-tariffs-china-diversify-iphone-2025-1?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=yahoo.com), with about 85% of its iPhones manufactured there.\n\n\"Apple produces basically all their iPhones in China, and the question will be around exceptions and exemptions on this tariff policy if those companies are building more operations, factories, and plants in the US[\u00a0like Apple announced in February](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/02/apple-will-spend-more-than-500-billion-usd-in-the-us-over-the-next-four-years/),\" Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said in a note to clients following the announcement.\n\nAs trade tensions escalate, Apple has moved to increase its supply chain beyond just China, boosting manufacturing in places like India and Vietnam. But with the new tariff announcements set to impact those countries too, there's now limited room for reprieve.\n\n\"The worry will be around pricing and margin impacts along with what this means for the global supply chain looking forward,\" Ives said. For now, the analyst continues to believe major negotiations will happen over the coming months as companies attempt to navigate \"this new world of tariffs.\"\n\nUntil then, he warned, \"tech stocks will clearly be under major pressure.\"\n\nOther Magnificent Seven players also faced significant selling action. In aggregate, that cohort of stocks is currently on track to eliminate over $800 billion from their collective market caps.\n\nIn afternoon trade, Amazon ([AMZN](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMZN)) and Nvidia ([NVDA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NVDA)) each fell 7%, followed by a 6% drop in both Alphabet ([GOOGL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOGL)) and Tesla ([TSLA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA)). Meta ([META](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/META)) dipped 3%, while Microsoft ([MSFT](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MSFT)) was off just under 2%.\n\nOutside of the Mag Seven, chip stocks faced similar declines, despite the exemption of semiconductors from Trump's additional tariffs. Nvidia competitor Broadcom ([AVGO](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AVGO)), for example, erased well over $50 billion from its market cap following an 8% drop in shares.\n\n\"The implications \\[of the announced tariffs\\] are broad-reaching, and we see negative implications for the whole \\[chip\\] sector,\" KeyBanc analyst John Vinh wrote in a note to clients. \"These are most notably going to negatively impact end-demand in key markets including smartphones/iPhones and PCs, as a significant amount of manufacturing is done within China.\"\n\nStacy Rasgon, Bernstein's managing director and senior analyst, added in an interview with Yahoo Finance that the biggest headwind for semiconductors is not necessarily the direct impact of tariffs. Rather, it's the risk of demand destruction as these products become more expensive.\n\nHe added, \"The other risk for semis is that they are very cyclical, very global, and very correlated to the macro and to GDP.\u00a0[So if this tips us into recession,\u00a0](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/us-economy-dangerously-vulnerable-to-recession-wall-street-reacts-to-tariff-fallout-155837444.html)that's probably not going to be great.\"",

I am targeting potentially good candidates for short-term trading; I have no opinion on them as investments. The potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting, everything else is secondary.\n\n**Stay agile, and be on the lookout for tariff news from Beijing.**\n\nNews: [Trump's Tariff Announcement](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/live-blog/2025-04-02/trump-s-tariff-announcement)\n\n[**AAPL (Apple)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AAPL&p=d)\\- 34% tariff on Chinese imports, adding to existing duties, brings the total to 54% effective April 9. AAPL relies heavily on Chinese manufacturing, and these tariffs are expected to lead to increased production costs, which will be passed on to consumers through higher prices. Watching $200, but likely the stock I'm going to play if there's any chance of a bounce (in addition to NVDA). These tariffs will result in retaliatory measures from China, further impacting Apple's supply chain and profitability. Additionally, prolonged tariffs could lower consumer demand due to higher prices. Related Tickers: AVGO, SWKS, TSM, QCOM.\n\n[**CRWV (CoreWeave)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=CRWV&p=d)\\- Google is reportedly in advanced discussions to rent Nvidia's Blackwell AI servers from CoreWeave. This potential partnership is huge because it means that CRWV has a little more diversification in their revenue stream (alleviating a huge risk to the company). It's hard, this has risen so much from the IPO but we're back at pre-tariff and pre-announcement prices- have a small long position but likely will exit due to all the craziness today and need to focus on the bigger fish. Despite Taiwanese chips not being tariffed, CRWV will likely benefit due to the rising costs of chips.\n\n[**RH (Restoration Hardware)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=RH&p=d)\\- Reported EPS of $1.58 vs $1.92 expected. Revenue of $812M vs $829M. The company issued guidance for the current fiscal year, projecting revenue growth of 10% to 13%, an adjusted operating margin between 14% and 15%, and an adjusted EBITDA margin of 20% to 21%. Management highlighted concerns over a higher-risk business environment due to tariffs, market volatility, and inflation risks, noting that RH has been operating in the \"worst housing market in almost 50 years.\" Interested at $150, but won't focus on this today vs AAPL or other Mag7 names that are selling off.\n\n[**VXX (VIX Short-Term Futures ETN)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=VXX&p=d)\\- The recent spike in volatility attributed to \"Liberation Day\" saw a massive VIX spike along with everything else selling off. Interested in seeing what we do but I doubt today will be the day I take a short position- volatility is coming and is not as likely to be the quick one-day spikes we've seen in the past. We may see additional tariffs from China in retaliation.\n\n[**NKE (Nike)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NKE&p=d)\\- Nike is one of the biggest losers due to tariffs, as a substantial portion of its manufacturing is based in Southeast Asian countries facing high tariff rates. Notably, Nike produces nearly 50% of its footwear and 30% of its apparel in Vietnam. Currently long, but will bail if we break new lows (\\~$55.20). Prolonged tariffs lead to higher consumer prices, and NKE has cited lowered demand/guidance for its goods due to competitors.\n\n[**NVDA (NVIDIA)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&p=d)\\- NVIDIA's exposure to the recent tariff announcements appears limited, as the 32% levy on imports from Taiwan. The White House clarified that semis are exempt from these tariffs, which provides a buffer for NVIDIA's core business and limits downside risk from the new trade measures. We still saw a 6% move post-tariff announcement.",

    "title": "Stocks Close Higher for 3rd Straight Day; Tesla Surges in Late Trading to Extend Rally",
    "selftext": "\nMajor indexes closed slightly higher Tuesday as the stock market continued its recovery from an extended selloff.\n\nThe S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite added 0.2% and 0.5%, respectively, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose fractionally. Stocks had kicked off the week with big gains following news that President Trump could scale back some of the tariffs that are due to be imposed next week on U.S. trading partners. With the recent gains, the Dow has inched back into positive territory for 2025, as stocks have rebounded from a month-long selloff spurred by concerns about the potential impact of tariffs and uncertainty about the outlook for the economy.\n\nInvestors brushed off consumer confidence data released this morning that came in weaker than expected, with the index hitting its lowest level in more than four years. Investors are closing watching all data points amid worries that tariffs could reignite inflation and cause economic growth to stall. The big economic report of the week comes Friday with the scheduled release of the Federal Reserve's preferred measure of inflation.\n\nThe yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which had fallen during the recent stock market rout amid the growing concerns about the economy, was at 4.32% in late trading, down from 4.33% at yesterday's close and from an earlier high Tuesday of 4.37%. The yield, which affects costs on all sorts of loans, notably mortgages, hit its highest level in more than a month this morning.\n\nMega-cap technology stocks, which helped lead Monday's rally, were mostly higher again today. Shares of Tesla (TSLA) rallied late in the day to finish 3.5% higher, gaining ground for the 5th consecutive session, despite news Tuesday that the EV maker's sales in Europe continued to slide. Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN) and Meta Platforms (META) each rose more than 1%, while Microsoft (MSFT) inched ahead. Chipmakers Nvidia (NVDA) and Broadcom (AVGO) closed slightly lower\n\n\n\nhttps://www.investopedia.com/dow-jones-today-03252025-11702763",

    "selftext": "Short sellers have been cleaning up to start 2025 amid a massive sell-off in some of the market's most popular names over the past two years.\n\nShort sellers have made a combined $15 billion betting against Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA) stock thus far this year, according to data from S3 Partners. Tesla shorts alone have raked in nearly $11 billion, while bets against Nvidia have brought in more than $4 billion.\n\nTesla's 40% year-to-date drop has led the declines of the so-called Magnificent Seven stocks. Investors have grown concerned about CEO Elon Musk's focus on government efficiency efforts and how his role with President Trump's administration could be a turnoff to the electric vehicle maker's customer base.\n\nBut it hasn't just been Tesla lagging. As an index, the Magnificent Seven \u2014 which also includes Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), and Meta (META) \u2014 is underperforming the S&P 500 this quarter by the most since 2022.\n\nShort sellers have profited off of all of the names in the cohort this year. They've brought in nearly $5 billion betting against Apple stock, which is down nearly 14% in 2025.\n\nThe crash in the most popular trade of the past two years comes as investors have been re-rating their growth expectations. Fears of slowing economic growth and the impact of Trump's tariff policies have weighed on markets. Meanwhile, Big Tech has faced growing investor criticism about its ballooning AI spend and whether or not it will eventually boost future profits as much as Wall Street hopes. The year also included a massive drawdown in some large tech names, including Nvidia, following the release of a cheaper AI model from Chinese company DeepSeek.\n\nNow, with most of the names sitting around 20% off their recent 52-week highs, the looming question for markets is whether or not investor appetite for the stocks that led the market higher for the past two years will return.\n\n\"Maybe these tech stocks got ahead of their skis a little bit,\" BMO Capital Markets chief investment strategist Brian Belski told Yahoo Finance last week. \"But at the end of the day, these are monster companies that define the growth trajectory for the United States stock market. They are not going away.\"\n\n[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/short-sellers-have-made-15-billion-betting-against-tesla-and-nvidia-in-2025-164652312.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/short-sellers-have-made-15-billion-betting-against-tesla-and-nvidia-in-2025-164652312.html)",

    "selftext": "Trump\u2019s latest trade policies are hammering the markets\u2014S&P 500 down \\~9%, Nasdaq off \\~12%\u2014and it looks like he\u2019s doubling down. Tariffs on China, Canada, Mexico, and the EU are back on the table, with zero indication that he\u2019s backing down. While some sectors (steel, domestic manufacturing) stand to benefit, others (tech, autos, multinational retailers) are getting crushed. The question is: at what point does the market pain force Trump to change course?\n\nThe **2025 Trade Policy Agenda** lays out his vision:\n\n\u2705 **Tariffs as leverage** \u2013 forcing trade partners into more \u201creciprocal\u201d deals\n\n\u2705 **USMCA review (2026)** \u2013 questioning whether Canada & Mexico are benefiting unfairly\n\n\u2705 **Hardline stance on China** \u2013 blaming it for the U.S. trade deficit and pushing for stricter enforcement of trade agreements\n\nHis strategy? **Drive U.S. production up, cut reliance on imports, and force foreign partners to play by his rules.** But markets are worried about **inflation, supply chain disruption, and retaliatory tariffs**\u2014all of which are starting to bite.\n\nNot every company is hurting\u2014some stand to **benefit significantly** from Trump\u2019s protectionist approach. Trump\u2019s tariffs **shield domestic manufacturers from foreign competition**, making U.S. steel, aluminum, and energy companies prime beneficiaries. E.g \n\n* **U.S. Steel** X 25% steel tariffs will boost profits\n* **Cleveland-Cliffs** CLF Increased demand for domestic steel\n* **Nucor** NUE Largest U.S. steel producer, stronger pricing power\n* **Anheuser-Busch** BUD Domestic production = insulated from trade costs\n* **Prologis** PLD Companies stockpiling goods = warehouse demand surge\n* **Lockheed Martin** LMT Defense spending likely to rise under Trump\n* **Marathon Petroleum** MPC Energy independence push favors domestic refiners\n\nCompanies with **complex supply chains** and reliance on **overseas production** are getting squeezed by **higher input costs and potential retaliatory tariffs**.E.g\n\n* **Apple** AAPL Major China exposure, supply chain at risk\n* **Tesla** TSLA Higher costs across supply chain, could hurt margins\n* **General Motors** GM Tariffs on parts increase manufacturing costs\n* **Ford** F Supply chain disruptions could impact production\n* **Nike** NKE Manufacturing in China = higher import costs\n* **Amazon** AMZN Increased cost of goods from global suppliers\n* **Boeing** BA Risk of Chinese retaliation cutting aircraft orders \n\nAre you positioning for a **domestic manufacturing boom**, or do you think **this trade war will spiral into a full-blown recession**? Should we be **buying the dip** in industrials or **shorting overexposed multinationals**?\n\n  \nTrump\u2019s strategy is clear: use **tariffs as a multipurpose weapon**, not just for trade but also for **immigration and national security**. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick hinted that **Canada & Mexico could avoid tariffs if they \u201cimprove border security\u201d and crack down on fentanyl trafficking**. This suggests Trump is **negotiating in multiple arenas at once**, using economic pressure to force compliance on broader policy goals.\n\nThe problem? **Markets hate uncertainty**, and businesses can\u2019t plan if policy keeps shifting based on unrelated factors. While some U.S. industries benefit, long-term uncertainty could hurt investment, expansion, and consumer confidence.",

I'm not putting down Apple's products - the iPhone did change the world, and Siri ...... well, at least the way we interact with our phones. But today, we're talking about stocks, and AAPL is looking more and more like a \u201cshareholder-funded AI experiment\u201d.\n\n\n\nApple's growth is slowing, iPhone sales are weak, and the company's attempts to boost demand with AI features like Apple Intelligence have frequently skipped a beat, with Siri's AI upgrade pushed back to 2026 or possibly even later, and iOS 18's bugs making the user experience even worse. Meanwhile, rivals like Google and Amazon have made significant strides in the AI assistant space.\n\n\n\nTo make matters worse, Apple's valuation is already ridiculously high, with a price-to-earnings ratio of 29x, well above the S&P 500's 20x. That's clearly unsustainable given its single-digit growth expectations. The irony is that Cook seems to be focusing more on growth in the services business, while innovation in the iPhone as a core product has been weak. So why exactly is this company still worth so much money? How do you see Apple's future? Is it time to reassess its valuation?\n\n",

His latest moves\u201425% steel and aluminum tariffs, expanded levies on Chinese imports, and a tariff-heavy negotiation strategy\u2014echo his first term but with even **stronger measures**.\n\n\n\nWhile 2018-2020 gave us some clues, the market setup in 2025 is **different**:\n\n\u2022 **Higher inflation & rates:** Tariffs add inflationary pressure, making the Fed\u2019s job harder.\n\n\u2022 **China\u2019s response will change:** Unlike in 2018, China now **dominates EV battery production** and **controls rare earth supply chains**\u2014this could hurt U.S. tech more than before.\n\n\u2022 **Supply chain resilience is mixed:** Companies have talked about reshoring for years, but it\u2019s still expensive and slow.\n\nGiven these factors, here\u2019s how I\u2019m positioning:\n\n**Likely Winners:**\n\n1. **Steel & Aluminum (NUE, STLD, CLF)** \u2013 Tariffs give them pricing power, though cost inflation is a risk.\n\n2. **Defense & Cybersecurity (LMT, PLTR, CRWD)** \u2013 \u201cAmerica First\u201d likely means **higher defense budgets**.\n\n3. **Regional Banks (JPM, BAC, GS)** \u2013 If deregulation follows, these should gain.\n\n4. **Domestic Infrastructure (CAT, DE, OSK)** \u2013 If tariffs hurt foreign suppliers, U.S. construction demand rises.\n\n\n\n**Likely Losers:**\n\n1. **Tech Giants (AAPL, NVDA, QCOM, INTC)** \u2013 Heavy China exposure = supply chain and revenue risks.\n\n2. **Consumer Goods (NKE, WMT, DG)** \u2013 Imports get pricier, and passing costs to lower-income customers is tough.\n\n3. **Auto & Industrial (TSLA, GM, F, MMM)** \u2013 Higher input costs + China retaliation = pain.\n\n4. **Agri Exporters (ADM, TSN, BG)** \u2013 If China targets U.S. farm products again, these get hit.\n\n\n\n**What I\u2019m watching:**\n\n\ud83d\udccc Will China retaliate with rare earth metal export bans? (Impacts TSLA, NVDA, QCOM)\n\n\ud83d\udccc Do inflation expectations rise, pushing Fed policy hawkish? (Bad for rate-sensitive stocks)\n\n\ud83d\udccc Does Trump backtrack on any tariffs? (A la 2019)\n\n\ud83d\udccc Will domestic manufacturing gains **outweigh** supply chain disruptions?\n\nI\u2019d love to hear counterpoints. Which stocks do you think will **outperform or underperform** in Trump\u2019s Trade War 2.0?",

    "title": "Trump's DOJ wants a Google breakup but is willing to leave AI alone",
    "selftext": "President Trump and his predecessor, Joe Biden, now largely agree on a major point that has the potential to reshape the tech world: Google should be broken up.\n\nBut there is an important difference that emerged in a filing last Friday: Trump\u2019s Justice Department wants to let Google (GOOG, GOOGL) keep its investments in artificial intelligence. It notably has a stake in OpenAI rival Anthropic worth billions.\n\nBacking off the Biden administration's request to force Google to sell off its AI bets was \"significant\" and \"very justified,\" said Mark McCareins, a business law professor at Northwestern University\u2019s Kellogg School of Management.\n\nIt \"may be an indication that the government worries about deterring AI advances in the global race with China,\" added David Olson, associate law professor at Boston College Law School.\n\nThe stock of Google's parent, Alphabet, dropped more than 4% Monday as other tech stocks also sold off on macroeconomic concerns.\n\nThe final decision on what happens to Google's $2 trillion empire in court will be in the hands of federal judge Amit Mehta, who ruled last August that Google illegally monopolized online markets for \"general search\" and \"general search text.\u201d\n\nNo matter what Mehta decides, Google is expected to appeal, and the DOJ can too. Hearings to decide on remedies in this case are slated for April and May.\n\nFinal remedy recommendations from the government and Google were due to the judge Friday, giving a Trump-led DOJ one last chance to alter the prior Biden-era suggestion to the judge that Google be broken up with the forced sale of Google\u2019s Chrome browser or contingent sale of its Android operating system.\n\nIt didn\u2019t do so, despite being lobbied by the company to reconsider the Chrome proposal on national security concerns.\n\n\"Google must divest the Chrome browser \u2014 an important search access point,\" the DOJ stated in its final proposal on Friday.\n\nIt argued that under a different owner, new rivals would have an \u201copportunity to operate a significant gateway to search the internet, free of Google\u2019s monopoly control.\u201d\n\nThey also retained part of a request to leave the door open to a possible divestiture of Google's Android operating system.\n\nBut prosecutors did drop the Biden DOJ's push for Google to sell off its AI bets, instead suggesting a setup where federal authorities could keep tabs on proposed AI investments that could threaten search competition.\n\nAnthropic has argued to the judge that forcing Google to relinquish its stake would tilt the AI playing field in favor of OpenAI and its backer, Microsoft (MSFT).\n\n\u201cPlaintiffs no longer seek the mandatory divestiture of Google\u2019s AI investments,\u201d the DOJ said Friday in its revised proposal.\n\nDerek Mountford, a shareholder in Gunster's business litigation practice group who specializes in antitrust litigation, said while the Trump administration's AI rollback is a concession, it comes with a hook.\n\n\"They're asking for some reporting requirements to be attached to it,\" he said.\n\n\"I think one of the [antitrust] themes you might see in a second Trump administration is even if they're walking back some of the proposed sanctions, there's still that element of control and monitoring and enforcement that's going on in the background.\"\n\nThe tension for the Trump administration, Chamber of Progress CEO Adam Kovacevich told Yahoo Finance last week, is that it is engaged in an existential fight with China for the future of AI and Google can still be an important weapon for the US.\n\n\"What are we going to do, hobble one of our main US runners in that race by breaking up that company?\u201d asked Kovacevich, who previously led Google's US policy strategy and external affairs team.\n\n\"It seems ill-timed to do that.\"\n\nThe DOJ did stick with another expected remedy proposal that strikes at a major contention in the case.\n\nIt asked the judge to block Google from contracts that secure its search engine as the default across dozens of internet-connected devices, such as mobile phones made by Apple (AAPL), Samsung, and others, and browsers, including Apple\u2019s Safari and Mozilla\u2019s Firefox.\n\nThat is not good news for Apple, jeopardizing a major revenue stream. In 2021, Google paid $26 billion for default search placements, and the lion's share of that went to Apple.\n\nBernstein analysts have estimated Apple\u2019s revenue from Google Search defaults is somewhere between $18 billion and $20 billion per year.\n\nGoogle countered the DOJ\u2019s request on Friday by asking that it still be free to enter into contracts to make Google search a default \u2014 so long as it does not condition search licensing based on device manufacturers also agreeing to distribute, preload, place, display, use, or license its AI Gemini Assistant Application.\n\nMcCareins, the law professor at Kellogg, said the DOJ has little to lose at this stage by holding on to Chrome divestment as a negotiating chip, given that both the underlying case and the judge's decision on remedies are subject to appeal.\n\n\"Just from a bargaining negotiating position, at this stage of the proceedings, I am not shocked or stunned that the new sheriffs in town have continued to argue for divestiture of Chrome,\" McCareins said.\n\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/trumps-doj-wants-a-google-breakup-but-is-willing-to-leave-ai-alone-080016759.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAACYwia9l044SxGCK_mri0gx-4TVLrnZzE1cLyqspOVq-n2zGEeY521rJZBcbAtAtZpG9pjQwjgHdoWCYutDGYaydayerBR3eZ7CxOK4KvoFb-5qR8PHIRJROnWQ40ALMQ9_HnlhH1NvgeQDycPTYmotjrq1CJK9_Z0lsxa8n3nyq",

    "title": "Trump, Chip Maker TSMC Expected to Announce $100 Billion Investment in U.S.",
    "selftext": "WASHINGTON\u2014Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. 2330 -1.92%decrease; red down pointing triangle intends to invest $100 billion in chip-manufacturing plants in the U.S. over the next four years under a plan expected to be announced later Monday by President Trump, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nThe investment would be used to build out cutting-edge chip-making facilities. Such an expansion would advance a long-pursued U.S. goal to regrow the domestic semiconductor industry after manufacturing fled largely to Asian countries in recent decades.\n\nTSMC, the world\u2019s largest contract chip-maker, set down roots in Arizona in 2020, when it said it would build a chip factory there for $12 billion. Its ambitions for the site have expanded rapidly since, with two more factories on the same site and a total investment of $65 billion. The company\u2019s first factory began mass production late last year.\n\nTSMC\u2019s announcement comes after years of deliberation regarding the future of semiconductor manufacturing in the U.S. and the global tech sector. The company currently builds its most advanced chip-making facilities only on its home soil Taiwan. The chips it produces are critical for powering everything from the latest artificial-intelligence systems to smartphones.\n\nSince the Biden administration, the U.S. has expressed concerns about TSMC\u2019s near-monopoly on advanced chip manufacturing and has been urging the company to relocate more of its cutting-edge production, including advanced chip-packaging facilities, to the U.S. Advanced chip packaging is particularly critical for AI-related chips, as it enhances performance by integrating multiple semiconductor components, reducing size, improving power efficiency, and ensuring faster data transfer\u2014key factors for AI applications.\n\n[awarded up to $6.6 billion of grants](https://www.wsj.com/tech/taiwanese-chip-making-giant-tsmc-gets-6-6-billion-for-arizona-project-f75e9de4?mod=article_inline), and has recently begun to receive federal money from the program. Generous tax credits have also boosted chip-making projects in the U.S.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re pleased to have an opportunity to meet with the President and look forward to discussing our shared vision for innovation and growth in the semiconductor industry, as well as exploring ways to bolster the technology sector along with our customers,\u201d TSMC said in a statement.\n\nU.S. officials see chip-making as a national-security imperative because economies, technological advancement and military might all are increasingly dependent on who has the best chips. Covid-era supply-chain issues also highlighted the critical nature of the industry when shortages of chips led to slowdowns in auto sales, among other disruptions.\n\nTrump has repeatedly called for more chip manufacturing in the U. S.\u2014although he criticized the Chips Act on the campaign trail and argued the better way to attract manufacturing was through tariffs. Last month, he said he was considering a 25% or more tariff on semiconductor imports.\n\n\u201cWe have to have chips made in this country. Right now, everything is made in Taiwan, practically, almost all of it, a little bit in South Korea, but everything\u2014almost all of it is made in Taiwan. And we want it to be made\u2014we want those companies to come to our country, in all due respect,\u201d Trump said in February.\n\nSince taking office, Trump has appeared at the White House with the chief executives of several companies to announce pledges to invest in the U.S. The details of the projects are often vague and it is often unclear whether the pledges represent\u00a0[new investments by the companies](https://www.wsj.com/tech/apple-corporate-new-job-investment-what-to-expect-ad19993c?mod=article_inline).\n\nOpenAI\u2019s\u00a0Sam Altman, database company\u00a0[Oracle](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/ORCL)\u00a0and investment giant\u00a0[SoftBank Group](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/JP/XTKS/9984)\u00a0pledged to invest as much as $500 billion into building artificial-intelligence infrastructure in the U.S., though Trump adviser\u00a0[Elon Musk](https://www.wsj.com/topics/person/elon-musk)\u00a0has questioned whether the project would come to fruition.\n\nLast week,\u00a0[Apple](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/AAPL)\u00a0said it plans to\u00a0[spend more than $500 billion](https://www.wsj.com/tech/apple-500-billion-investment-us-19ca11a0?mod=article_inline)\u00a0over the next four years to expand its manufacturing footprint in the U.S.\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/tech/trump-chip-maker-tsmc-expected-to-announce-100-billion-investment-in-u-s-02a44399?mod=hp_lead_pos6",

    "selftext": "Year after year Reddit picks the winners! I have kept a close eye on this subreddit for the last 10-15 years and have always been amazed by how ahead of the curve we are. Here is a list of stocks that have been heavily discussed over the years that have performed very well: \n\n- Tesla \n- Shopify \n- Block\n- NVDA \n- AMD \n- PLTR\n- AAPL \n- GME\n\nI know everyone in the comments is going to claim this is selection bias, but I can assure you these stocks were talked about so much it is unmistakable. People will also claim but these stocks have tanked since then! They have had significant corrections, but if you bought them when the buzz began you are still significantly in the green.  We will have to wait and see what the future holds. \n\n But what about the losers like movie pass!? Of course, some losers have been overly hyped too, but they are far less common. Also, in my opinion, the tone around stocks like movie pass is totally different than a stock like NVDA or SHOP. \n\nThe beautiful part about Reddit is you hear both sides, SHOP had a great deal of resistance back in 2017 and still does. A lot of people claimed it was a worthless company. People like Andrew Left were worshipped for shorting the company. But at the end of the day it was posted about non stop and has performed extremely well. People were also screaming from the top of the mountain that NVDA was overpriced in 2017, look where that ended up. \n\nLately it feels like we have entered a new \u201chype\u201d cycle where a lot of new names have been heavily mentioned. Similar to the hype cycle of 2016-2017 there is a lot of resistance and great discussions behind had. Here are some new names that I have noticed being posted about non stop: \n\n- RKLB\n- IONQ \n- BBAI\n- CAVA \n- LUNR\n- SMCI\n- OKLO \n- BRO\n\nI have been seeing these tickers fly around lately and see a lot of promise in them. They have performed very well in the past 6 months to a year, but we will have to wait and see where they end up in the long term. \n\nIt\u2019s a common meme to short every stock Reddit mentions, but I ultimately disagree. The hive mind is a very powerful and can seemingly predict the future. Keep in mind, the hive mind is what sets the vegas spreads. \n\nAnyway, that\u2019s my rant for the day. I am sure 75% of you will disagree with me, but again, thats why I love Reddit. Would love to hear your opinions. \n\nAlso, I have holdings in most of the companies listed. This is not financial advice. Do your own due diligence before buying any company I listed. ",

    "title": "On Market Timing",
    "selftext": "You cannot time the market, but there are times when it is due for a crash. At those times you definitely don\u2019t want to buy on the dips, and you want to sell a bit more on the rips. Major market declines can happen really fast (think of the flash crash), but major declines like 2000 and 2008 give you notice that they\u2019re coming. **Crashes occur when a majority of investors are just wrong about something big.** If you want to make money on stocks over the long run, it\u2019s good to see the crashes coming. I\u2019m pretty sure that one is coming now. I'm a successful investor with 30 years in equities. Let me review my experience in the dot com crash and the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nI started investing significantly in 1996, when I got a better paying job. It was fun. You could identify new technologies and hold on for meteoric rise. I made a lot on IOM and AFFX. But it was clear that the market did not actually understand the internet. A company could double its market capitalization by getting a web site and renaming itself a dot com. Valuations reflected the mistaken idea that doing exactly the same business online was somehow going to be much more profitable. I remember realizing that I owned stocks that were worth far more than the underlying value of the company, but kept going up. I developed a rule (sell a third every time it triples) to get my money back while continuing to profit from the insanity. When things started to turn south, it didn\u2019t take a genius to get out. When the bleeding stopped, I was early to get back in, looking for stocks that found support (low volume on down days) during the crash. Among the stocks I bought in 2001, I\u2019ve done the best with AAPL.\n\nThe other big bear market I went through was 2008. Again, the fall can be traced to something that the majority of investors had wrong. I remember talking to a mortgage broker in 2004. They were pushing balloon mortgages and other nonsense that allowed people to buy houses they could not afford. I asked about the terms, and realized that shit would hit the fan in 2007 or 2008. It was not hard to see. There were a lot of these mortgages. As a homeowner, I got cold calls inviting me to refinance my 30 year fixed with something that would have a lower rate for a few years before exploding. Again, the economy was headed in the wrong direction because the market somehow thought these were safe. I can\u2019t claim to have seen the crash coming (I thought the damage would be limited to foolish homeowners), but leveraged collateralized mortgage obligations set financial markets up for a fall. My point is that, once again, the market fell because the market was just wrong about something, and eventually reality could no longer be ignored.\n\nWe\u2019re here again. A lot of people think Trump/DOGE will be good for business. Taxes will be cut and government waste eliminated. They do not understand how the parts of government being eliminated are good for business. I\u2019ll give you three examples. First, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has been eliminated, or at least crippled. The idea is that less regulation is a good thing. But without that protection, more consumers are going to be subject to scams, and the more sophisticated are not going to use services like X Money at all, because they are no longer safe. Second, there have been huge cuts to funding for science (NIH, USDA, NSF, etc.) with almost no attempt to identify what spending is actually wasteful. Innovation comes from science, so this will be very very bad for business over the long run. Third, DOGE cancelled legal contracts for government services with no warning. Even if you think that providing services to refugees is wasteful, it\u2019s not fraudulent, and the American businesses who had those contracts were obviously hurt, as was trust in the government. \n\nIs it too late to avoid disaster? Maybe not, but I don\u2019t see Donald Trump saying \u201coops\u201d anytime soon.\n\nSo, we\u2019re there again. The market will fall because the market is wrong about something big.  \nYou can\u2019t time the market, but this is not the time to buy on the dips, and I\u2019ve been selling.",

    "title": "Warren Buffett sounds warning to Washington as Berkshire reports record profit, cash",
    "selftext": "https://www.reuters.com/business/warren-buffett-says-us-should-spend-wisely-plans-increase-investment-japan-2025-02-22/?utm_source=reddit.com\n\nNEW YORK, Feb 22 (Reuters) - Berkshire Hathaway (BRKa.N), opens new tab on Saturday reported record annual profits and boosting its cash stake to $334.2 billion, as Warren Buffett used his annual shareholder letter to caution Washington to spend money wisely and take care of those who get the \"short straws in life.\"\n\nBuffett's admonition came as many investors worry U.S. lawmakers won't rein in soaring fiscal deficits, and could make them worse by extending tax cuts backed by President Donald Trump.\n\nThe 94-year-old Buffett, the world's sixth-richest person and arguably its most famous investor, also acknowledged his advanced age, telling shareholders he uses a cane and will spend less time fielding their questions at Berkshire's annual meeting on May 3.\n\nHe nonetheless assured shareholders they would be in good hands after he turns over the conglomerate's reins to Vice Chairman Greg Abel, saying the 62-year-old Abel has \"vividly shown his ability\" to deploy capital.\n\n\"It won't be long\" before Abel takes over, Buffett said.\n\nBuffett's letter was accompanied by Berkshire's annual report, where it reported a third straight record annual operating profit, rising 27% to $47.44 billion.\n\nQuarterly operating profit rose 71% to $14.53 billion, also a record, and which analysts viewed as solid.\n\nNet income for the full year totaled $89 billion, including gains from Berkshire's common stock investments such as Apple (AAPL.O), opens new tab and American Express (AXP.N), opens new tab.\n\nBerkshire's cash stake reflected high business valuations and nine straight quarters of selling more stocks than it bought. The selling included Apple, which remained its largest stock investment.\n\n\"Often, nothing looks compelling; very infrequently we find ourselves knee-deep in opportunities,\" Buffett wrote.\n\n'FISCAL FOLLY'\n\nThis year is Buffett's 60th at the helm of Berkshire, which he transformed from a failing textile company into a $1.03 trillion conglomerate with dozens of businesses in insurance, railroad, energy, industrial, retail and other sectors.\n\n\"Berkshire's activities now impact all corners of our country. And we are not finished,\" Buffett said.\n\nBuffett said Berkshire will continue preferring equities, primarily U.S. stocks, over cash, even as it resists paying a dividend to shareholders, which it has not done since 1967.\n\nHe said reinvesting in Berkshire is one reason the Omaha, Nebraska-based company paid $26.8 billion of federal taxes last year, 5% of all payments by corporate America. Buffett himself is worth $149.5 billion, Forbes magazine said,\nBut he also sent a cautionary message to Washington, lamenting how capitalism \"has its faults and abuses--in certain respects more egregious now than ever,\" with malfeasance by \"scoundrels and promoters\" in full force.\n\nHe urged lawmakers to help preserve a stable U.S. dollar, saying \"fiscal folly\" can destroy the value of paper money and the country has at times \"come close to the edge.\"\n\nBuffett said long-term success of Berkshire and the American economy, which he called the \"American miracle,\" has depended on people's ability to participate.\n\nThat, he said, is something Uncle Sam can encourage, or take away.\n\n\"Take care of the many who, for no fault of their own, get the short straws in life. They deserve better,\" Buffett wrote, addressing the government.\n\"And never forget that we need you to maintain a stable currency and that result requires both wisdom and vigilance on your part,\" he added.\n\nCathy Seifert, an analyst at CFRA Research who rates Berkshire \"hold,\" said: \"Talking about the business of America being messy was his way of addressing the political landscape and its impact on the macroeconomic environment. He is warning Washington: Be careful where you tread.\"\n\nFEWER BUYING OPPORTUNITIES\n\nWhile Berkshire has not made a major purchase of an entire company since 2016, Buffett said it is likely to increase its combined $23.5 billion of investments in five Japanese trading houses: Itochu (8001.T), opens new tab, Marubeni (8002.T), opens new tab, Mitsubishi (8058.T), opens new tab, Mitsui (8031.T), opens new tab and Sumitomo (8053.T), opens new tab.\n\nOther stocks appear pricey, with the Standard & Poor's 500 (.SPX), opens new tab hitting a new high on Wednesday and the Nasdaq (.IXIC), opens new tab just 3% below its December 16 peak.\n\nBerkshire's size also inhibits its shares from trouncing the indexes, as they did decades ago.\nThe company's stock price has risen 15% in the last year, while the Standard & Poor's 500 rose 18%.\n\nOver the last decade, Berkshire's stock price has risen 225%, while the index rose 241% including dividends and 185% excluding dividends, Reuters data show.\n\n\"They will have lots of buying opportunities but Berkshire will never be the large double-digit compounder it had been,\" said Bill Smead, chief investment officer at Smead Capital Management in Phoenix.\n\nAt Berkshire's annual meeting, Buffett will spend less time on the stage in a downtown Omaha arena where he, Abel and Vice Chairman Ajit Jain will answer shareholder questions.\n\nTens of thousands of people attend the meeting and a weekend of shareholder events, including shopping.\n\nBuffett told Fortune magazine last month that he was still having fun and able to do a few things reasonably well, while other activities had been \"eliminated or greatly minimized.\"\n\nThe meeting will also not feature the traditional movie created by Buffett's daughter Susie.\nIn discussing his age, Buffett said he talks regularly on Sundays with his 91-year-old sister Bertie, using an old-fashioned phone.\n\n\"We cover the joys of old age and discuss such exciting topics as the relative merits of our canes,\" he said. \"In my case, the utility is limited to the avoidance of falling flat on my face.\"\n\n",

Im not sure how they build out this branch of Meta, Im calling it Meta Defense but they fired all their woke people and are starting to re-shape the company.\n\nYes, there is defense spending cuts but its all on waste and overcharged contracts not on things that actually matter for the dept of defense.

    "selftext": "Source: Investor Business Daily reporting on Twitter post.\n\nA top Apple (AAPL) stock analyst says the consumer electronics giant is mulling whether to make a humanoid robot.\n\nIn a post on social network X on Wednesday, TF International Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said Apple is exploring both humanoid and nonhumanoid robots as part of its future smart-home ecosystem.\n\n\"These products are still in the early proof-of-concept (POC) stage internally,\" Kuo said. \"Given current progress and typical development cycles, Apple's robot mass production likely won't start until 2028 or later.\"\n\n\"Interestingly, Apple has been unusually open about sharing some of its robotics research during the early POC stage \u2014 possibly to attract talent,\" he added.\n\nKuo cautioned that Apple is still very early in the product development cycle. The proof-of-concept stage is a \"testing ground\" used to determine whether core technologies and product ideas are viable before proceeding.\n\nApple's rumored foldable iPhone is also in the proof-of-concept stage, he said.\n\n\"However, many projects never progress beyond POC \u2014 the Apple Car is probably the most notable example of a project that got stuck at this stage,\" Kuo said.",

    "title": "AAPL - 26,527.62% return over 25 years",
    "selftext": "Today to the day is the anniversary of twenty five years of my first purchase of AAPL shares.  I bought 1200 dollars worth.\n\nIn early 2000, I had just graduated college.  I had a few thousand given to me as an inheritance that was being managed by a broker.\n\n I asked the broker about purchasing some Apple shares, and he was unimpressed, and unmoved. I was annoyed at him. Apple was the one I had the strongest impulse to purchase.\n\n Why apple? I had gone from being skeptical of Apple. My  college was very heavily Mac, but I had PCs.  I was unimpressed at the OS, but I was struck by people\u2019s reactions to Jobs.  He was enthusiastic, and I liked the cut of the jib who liked the cut of his jib. I was drawn to the elitism of the people to the brand, and felt it could bounce back. This was even before iPods, mind you, before OS X.  \n\nThese were the days of the dotcom boom. This broker was taking like 500 bucks for every trade. This felt unfair, in light of the great digital democratization that was in progress, I wanted the power.  And E*trade was relatively new and it seemed legit.  I hadn\u2019t done anything like this before, I was just a kid, really, but I decided to just go for it. \n\nI sold most of the shares I inherited, and threw 1200 bucks into Apple.  `(also a few other, less impressive stocks)' I did marvelously the first few months as the market soared, as did most people. \n\nAnd\u2026. it  came tumbling down in April 2000.  Disillusioned, I decided not to try to reposition my shares, and I just let things ride for a few months.  When I rebalanced by portfolio, I kept my apple shares, which had split, despite the pull-back.\n\nEvery year, I would consider would I buy more apple now?  And it didn't occurr me to sell. Apple often seemed almost comically undervalued, and I held on or increased my investment in it.\n\nEvery time apple goes up 1 point, I get more than my initial investment back. Why? Splits.\n\n\u2022\t2-for-1 split in 2000  \n\u2022\t2-for-1 split in 2005  \n\u2022\t7-for-1 split in 2014  \n\u2022\t4-for-1 split in 2020\n\nNowadays cost basis: .88 cents.     As of today that investment has grown 26,527.62%. I added more and more apple across the years, and had some other lucky calls (my second largest holding is NVDA) but no move matches that whimsical lucky move of 25 years ago today.\n\nThe security that owning these securities has offered me is significant.  It has let me have a job that isn\u2019t that well-payed and support my family with emergencies being take of by extra funds. We own a lot of apple products, because with the dividends, it sort of just pays for them.\n\nI do think it\u2019s good to give early adults access to a few thousand dollars to play the market and plan to do that with my own children.  Although I didn\u2019t sell my shares, what I did do is convert a bunch of them to a donor advised fund (avoiding taxes, whee), and I give to charity from that for annual giving, and that feels like a win win win proposition.  \n\nI do feel overexposed in AAPL and NVDA, but due to still hopefully having another at least 25 years to go in my life is that pullbacks eventually come back up. The biggest principle that has guided my investing is \u201cDon\u2019t buy crap if you can help it\u201d, and that's my advice to new investors.",

Deepseek capabilities are expected to be copied by US firms.\n\nNews: [Fed's Favored Inflation Gauge Posted Muted Advance In December](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-31/fed-s-favored-inflation-gauge-posted-muted-advance-in-december)\n\nTicker: [AAPL (Apple Inc.)](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AAPL&p=d)\n\nCatalyst: Apple reported EPS of $2.40 vs. $2.35, and revenue of $124.3B vs 124B.\n\nDespite these positive results, the company provided cautious guidance for the upcoming quarter, citing uncertainties related to the impact of new AI features on sales. Tim Cook mentioned that Apple Intelligence DID lead to stronger sales/growth in areas where it was rolled out (it has limited rollout right now).\n\nVolume/Market Cap/Technicals: Watching $250 level, no strong bias. We've seen AAPL swing close to 20% this month, (on report of sales weakness in China) but doubt this will continue.\n\nContext: Most immediate news that comes to mind was the weakness of sales in China for the iPhone, causing the move this month.\n\nRisks: Don't really see immediate risks beyond the trade war, in 2019/2020 this resulted in AAPL moving manufacturing/production to other countries in South East Asia- slowing growth in China has been pretty consistent, however.\n\nRelated Tickers: rest of FAANG, Samsung if you can trade overseas stocks, the various phone component manufacturers that trade with AAPL\n\nOffhand: Apple is investing in its own high-speed network infrastructure to enhance content delivery, (just like META's undersea pipeline)\n\nTicker: [ACMR (ACM Research, Inc.)](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=ACMR&p=d)\n\nCatalyst: Kerrisdale Capital released a bullish report on ACM Research (ACMR), a semiconductor wafer fabrication equipment (WFE) company positioned in China but headquartered in America.\n\nIt leads China as a leading supplier of wafer cleaning tools and beneficiary of China's push toward semiconductor self-sufficiency.\n\nKerrisdale predicts the company to eventually compete globally and cites it as a potential 10x return. Trades at 1x 2025E revenue (likely due to China fears).\n\nVolume/Market Cap/Technicals: This is the interesting part- ACMR holds a $1.2B mkt cap but trades at a massive discount compared to its Chinese subsidiary (ACMS), which has a $5.9 billion market cap and trades at 6x 2025E revenue.\n\nThe report suggests that ACMR\u2019s NASDAQ valuation is severely mispriced and could re-rate significantly as investors recognize the valuation gap.\n\nContext: China/US chip war, you guys know what this is.\n\nSector Context: The global semiconductor industry is shifting, with China attempting to localize chip production.\n\nKerrisdale argues that restrictions on U.S. and Japanese WFE exports to China will only fuel ACMR\u2019s growth as Chinese fabs increasingly turn to domestic suppliers.\n\nChina's WFE self-sufficiency has grown from 4% in 2019 to 17% in 2024 and is expected to reach 36% by 2026.\n\nRisks: Geopolitical factors, including further U.S. export restrictions, could impact ACMR\u2019s operations. Similar to how we have the NVDA trade restriction going on right now. However, Kerrisdale sees these restrictions as a net positive due to ACMR having less competition in China as a result. There are other players in the WFE space in China, but ACMR has a technological moat.\n\nRelated Tickers: LRCX, AMAT, KLAC\n\nTicker: [INTC](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=INTC&p=d)\n\nCatalyst: Intel reported revenue of $14.26B vs exp of $13.81B. Most important, the company anticipated breakeven EPS next quarter.\n\nVolume/Market Cap/Technicals: Somewhat rangebound for the past 3 months. Watching $20 but nothing interesting I'm watching beyond that.\n\nContext: This earnings report is Intel's first since the departure of CEO Pat Gelsinger. Right now INTC is being led by two interim co-CEOs, and another price catalyst that could potentially happen is someone competent being picked lol. Also worth thinking of the NVDA/Deepseek/semiconductor news when reading through these catalysts.\n\nIntel has also announced a delay in its Falcon Shores GPU and only using it internally within the company.\n\nRisks: Intel faces significant competition from companies such as NVIDIA and AMD, the delay of their chip is pretty bad news.\n\nRelated Tickers: AMD/NVDA/TSM\n\nTicker: [ASTS](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=ASTS&p=d)\n\nCatalyst: ASTS has received special temporary authority from the FCC to test its space-based cellular broadband network in the United States. Allows for collaboration efforts with VZ/T.\n\nVolume/Market Cap/Technicals: Slight rise, but will watch this at open to see if volume comes in.\n\nContext: The FCC's authorization allows ASTS to provide cell/satellite comms, allowing for greater coverage and signals that more use of ASTS satellites. I remember that the company was essentially valued based on each satellite they launched successfully in 2024, whether that hype returns remains to be seen but overall not interested in trading this unless we have retail interest again.\n\nSector Context: SpaceX's Starlink is also entering the direct-to-cell market, as I noted a few days ago- most of the investment that can be done in these type of cell/sat comms in public markets can really only be done in ASTS.\n\nRisks: If SpaceX IPOs we might see a selloff in this stock simply because SpaceX is far larger/established and Elon Musk has closer ties to the government.\n\nRelated Tickers: T/VZ/RKLB",

    "title": "Apple misses on iPhone revenue, sees 11% drop in China sales",
    "selftext": "Apple\u2019s overall revenue rose by 4% in the first quarter, but it missed on Wall Street\u2019s iPhone sales expectations and saw sales in China decline 11.1%, the company reported on Thursday. \n\nHere\u2019s how Apple did versus LSEG consensus estimates for the quarter ending Dec. 28. \n\nEarnings per share: $2.40 vs. $2.35 estimated \n\nRevenue: $124.30 billion vs. $124.12 billion estimated \n\n iPhone revenue: $69.14 billion vs. $71.03 billion estimated \n\nMac revenue: $8.99 billion vs. $7.96 billion estimated \n\niPad revenue: $8.09 billion vs. $7.32 billion estimated \n\nOther Products revenue: $11.75 billion vs. $12.01 billion estimated \n\nServices revenue: $26.34 billion vs. $26.09 billion estimated \n\nGross margin: 46.9% vs. 46.5% estimated \n\n Although Apple\u2019s overall sales rose during the quarter, the company\u2019s closely watched iPhone sales actually declined slightly on a year-over-year basis. The December quarter is the first full quarter with iPhone 16 sales, and Apple released its Apple Intelligence AI suite for the devices during the quarter.  \n\nApple\u2019s iPhone miss versus LSEG estimates was the biggest for the company in two years, since its first-quarter earnings report in fiscal 2023. At the time, Apple said that its miss was because it was unable to make enough iPhone 14 models because of production issues in China. \n\nThe company saw significant weakness in Greater China, which includes the mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Overall China sales declined 11.1% during the quarter to $18.51 billion. It\u2019s the largest drop in China sales since the same quarter last year when they fell 12.9%. \n\nApple CEO Tim Cook told CNBC\u2019s Steve Kovach that iPhone sales were stronger in countries where Apple Intelligence is available. Currently, the software is only available in a handful of English-speaking countries, and it isn\u2019t accessible in China or in Chinese. \n\n\u201cDuring the December quarter, we saw that in markets where we had rolled out Apple intelligence, that the year-over-year performance on the iPhone 16 family was stronger than those markets where we had not rolled out Apple intelligence,\u201d Cook said.  \n\nCook told CNBC that there were three factors in the company\u2019s China performance. He said that half of the 11.1% decline was due to a change in \u201cchannel inventory,\u201d the fact that Apple Intelligence hasn\u2019t launched in the region and that after the quarter ended, China issued a national subsidy that would stimulate some Apple product sales.  \n\n\u201cIf you look at the negative 11, half of the decline is due to a change in channel inventory, and so the operational performance is better,\u201d Cook said. \n\nApple executives usually give some color about how the current quarter is shaping up on a call with analysts. Wall Street is expecting guidance for the March quarter of $1.66 in earnings per share on $95.46 billion in revenue. \n\nThe company reported $36.33 billion in net income during the quarter, up 7.1% from $33.92 billion in the same period last year. \n\nApple\u2019s iPad and Mac sales showed strong growth over last year\u2019s struggling sales in the holiday quarter. Mac revenue rose 15% to $8.98 billion and iPad revenue grew 15% to $8.08 billion. \n\nThe company released new Macs during the quarter, including new iMac, Mac Mini and MacBook Pro laptops in October, partially contributing to the growth. Apple also launched a new iPad Mini during the quarter. Cook attributed the growth to the new products.  \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s driven by the significant excitement around our latest Mac lineup,\u201d Cook said.  \n\nApple\u2019s profit engine, its Services division, which includes subscriptions, warranties and licensing deals, reported $23.12 billion in revenue, which is 14% higher than the same period last year. Cook said that the company had over 1 billion subscriptions, which includes both direct subscriptions for services like Apple TV+ and iCloud, as well as subscriptions to third-party apps through the company\u2019s App Store system.  \n\nThe company\u2019s \u201cother products\u201d category, also called Wearables, which includes Apple Watch, AirPods, Beats and Vision Pro sales, declined 2% on a year-over-year basis to $11.75 billion in sales. \n\nApple said it would pay a dividend of 25 cents per share and spent $30 billion on dividends and share repurchases during the first quarter.   \n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/30/apple-aapl-q1-earnings-2025.html",

Personally I think the vision-only approach is not viable in the long-run but hey, I'm no self-driving PHD. \n\nCAPEX was ALSO higher as with META due to spending increases from AI training infra costs and battery production capacity.\n\n**Volume/Market Cap/Technicals:** I'm mainly interested in the $375/$400 level, not too interested in going long despite the multi-day slide in price.\n\n**Context:** Main reason for TSLA's selloff was the lack of full-year guidance (it gives the subtext that it's too bad to release publically or it's up in the air). Political statements made by Musk may contribute to future issues for TSLA.\n\n**Sector Context:** Revenue shortfall was caused due to lower-than-expected vehicle deliveries/ increased sale incentives, 496K cars vs 507K exp. China's BYD is rapidly catching up, and the (possible) removal of the US EV tax credit may make EV's more expensive\n\n**Risks:** Mainly geopolitical- if the tariffs on EV vehicles imported to the US gets removed, TSLA will face fiercer competition from BYD. Also Elon Musk.\n\n**Related Tickers:** BYD (but mainly trades in China, TSLA isn't as impacted by AI news.)\n\n\n\n[**NVDA (NVIDIA Corporation) (in addition to ARM/AMD/SMH/SOXL/semiconductor stocks)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&p=d)\n\n**Catalyst:** The reveal of Deepseek has introduced an AI model that rivals existing solutions but was developed at around $6M. However there's a rumor that Deepseek is actually trained on 50K H100 NVDA gpus.\n\n**Yesterday after the close, there was an announcement Trump officials discussing tightening curbs on Nvidia's China sales.**\n\n**Volume/Market Cap/Technicals:** Overall, there's been a massive selloff since NVDA was $150 at the end of last week. Overall interested again if we hit $116, but low confidence we'll sell off again. \n\nCurrently long.\n\n**Sector Context:** Not much to really say about this beyond NVDA having the most advanced chips that are widespread for training because of the CUDA architecture- most people are doubtful that the TOTAL cost was $6M\n\nUS Officials are examining export restrictions but China will likely find a way to bypass them as they have previously.\n\n**Risks:** Mainly geopolitical, again. Obviously it's very difficult to restrict trade to a country that we have no military presence in or surround, and China is economically far more powerful than those we have attempted trade restrictions on in the past.\n\n**Related tickers:** (Mentioned above)\n\n**Earnings today:** AAPL, INTC, V,TEAM",

    "title": "Apple and SpaceX Link Up to Support Starlink Satellite Network on iPhones",
    "selftext": "**Thoughts:** Obviously good for companies that are involved in the sat comm business (but may be bad/neutral for sat comm companies that do not work with AAPL such as GSAT), TMUS, and AAPL. TSLA is also possibly affected because SpaceX trades as a proxy to TSLA news. VZ/T/other phone providers may be affected but the use case is so niche that I won't hold my breath. \n\n>Apple Inc. has been secretly working with SpaceX and T-Mobile US Inc. to add support for the Starlink network in its latest iPhone software, providing an alternative to the company\u2019s in-house satellite-communication service.\n\n>\n\n>The companies have been testing iPhones with the Starlink service from Elon Musk\u2019s Space Exploration Technologies Corp., according to people with knowledge of the matter. In an under-the-radar move, the smartphone\u2019s latest software update \u2014 released Monday \u2014 now supports the technology.\n\n>\n\n>The tie-up comes as a surprise: T-Mobile has previously only specified Starlink as an option for Samsung Electronics Co. phones, such as the Z Fold and S24 models. Apple, meanwhile, already provides a Globalstar Inc. offering that lets consumers send texts and contact emergency responders when out of cellular range.\n\n>\n\n>T-Mobile has begun allowing customers to sign up for an early version of the Starlink service, and this week the carrier enabled a small number of iPhones as part of a beta test.\n\n>\n\n>The first users received text messages from T-Mobile saying, \u201cYou\u2019re in the T-Mobile Starlink beta. You can now stay connected with texting via satellite from virtually anywhere. To start experiencing coverage beyond, please update to iOS 18.3.\u201d Users in the program have a new toggle switch in their iPhone cellular data settings to manage the satellite feature.\n\n>\n\n>An Apple spokesperson declined to comment, while T-Mobile said that the test will \u201cbegin with select optimized smartphones\u201d and that the full launch will \u201csupport the vast majority of modern smartphones.\u201d T-Mobile has also opened the beta to some users running Android 15, the latest version of the Google operating system. A representative for SpaceX didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\n>\n\n>Ever since Apple teamed up with Globalstar to offer satellite features in 2022, there\u2019s been speculation over whether it might support competing networks. The day after Apple\u2019s 2022 announcement, Musk posted on X that his company has \u201chad some promising conversations with Apple about Starlink connectivity.\u201d\n\n>\n\n>Here\u2019s how it will work: When a T-Mobile iPhone is in an area without cellular connectivity, devices that are part of the Starlink program will first try to pair with SpaceX satellites. Users will also be able to enable texting via the satellite menu for the Globalstar service or contact emergency services through Apple.\n\n>\n\n>The initial version of Starlink is exclusively for texting. But SpaceX and T-Mobile have said that they plan to expand into data connections and voice calls in the future. The program also is only available in the US for now. That contrasts with Apple\u2019s Globalstar service, which works in several countries. SpaceX is looking to expand Starlink to other carriers globally.\n\n>\n\n>There\u2019s another major difference between the two services. The current Apple feature requires users to point their iPhone to the sky to find a satellite. The Starlink option, meanwhile, is designed to work automatically \u2014 even when the phone is in a customer\u2019s pocket.\n\n>\n\n>Both the Starlink and Apple satellite features are designed to work in off-the-grid areas, such as hiking trails, that don\u2019t have cellular service. The capabilities can\u2019t be used in places where a mobile-phone network is within reach. Support for the Apple feature is available on most current iPhone models and the company plans to bring it to its Ultra smartwatch later this year, Bloomberg News has reported.\n\n>\n\n>T-Mobile updated its website this week to tell beta testers that the iPhone is supported as part of the iOS 18.3 software release. As of now, the number of users in the beta is minimal, with T-Mobile planning to expand the program in February. Apple\u2019s announcement of iOS 18.3 touted AI features and bug fixes, but it didn\u2019t disclose the Starlink support.\n\n>\n\n>SpaceX requested authority to begin beta-testing the service starting Monday. The Federal Communications Commission granted SpaceX conditional approval for its satellites to supplement T-Mobile\u2019s cellular network in November.\n\nLink: [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-29/apple-and-spacex-link-up-to-support-starlink-satellite-network-on-iphones](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-29/apple-and-spacex-link-up-to-support-starlink-satellite-network-on-iphones)",

That drop was partly corrected on Tuesday, with Nvidia shares up around 5% in premarket trading.\n\n",

As I am still on the basics I can't help myself but ask, even long term, is SPY a better bet than, let's say, AAPL?\nI understand that sometimes picking the \"good\" stock is difficult, but even 10 years ago Apple was among the companies with the highest market cap and still managed to outperform the index.\n\nSo I have 2 stupid questions based on this:\n1. In your opinion, might this continue to happen in the future? Not necessarily apple but alphabet, Microsoft, nvidia or Meta are safer bets than Spy?\n2. What are your recommendations on where to learn about investing into individual stocks, not say trading but more middle term (I believe it's called swing trading?)\n\nThanks in advance!",

    "selftext": "After a year of trying an Ameriprise managed account, I recently moved everything to Fidelity to start managing it myself. They underperformed the S&P500 (before their fee), and almost all positions are just S&P500 companies anyways, so I figured if I went 100% into an S&P index on my own I can't do worse.\n\nI'm not sure how best to proceed with the current number of individual stocks. There are 64 positions total and it's unrealistic that I'll be able to keep track of the performance/trajectory of that many companies. Buffet's \"pick a few winners\" comes to mind. I've been assuming the best thing to do is to slowly liquidate the one's I don't have a specific interest in, and buy VOO/SPY in their place.\n\nThere are many companies that I like and would like to hold on to (AAPL, AMD, AMZN, BRKB, GOOGL, JNJ, KO, MSFT, NVDA, NFLX, PG). However, the majority are S&P 500 companies that I don't follow closely (ABT, ADBE, AMAT, AMGN, AMT, AVGO, AZN, BA, BMY, CAT, COP, CRM, CVX, ... to name a few). It's not that I don't know those companies, but it feels ignorant to hold onto them knowing that I won't have time to monitor their performance.\n\nIs there a best way to go about liquidating those and moving into an S&P 500 index? Initial temptation is gambler's fallacy (sell the low performers first and keep the better ones a bit longer).",

    "selftext": "[AAPL Shares Outstanding 2015-2024](https://preview.redd.it/x8mz301v4j6e1.png?width=2379&format=png&auto=webp&s=5465bd515fa9d34f24efc5049a92eee43db7e71c)\n\n[AAPL EPS 2015-2024](https://preview.redd.it/zqnduwj26j6e1.png?width=2380&format=png&auto=webp&s=f29e81e783d13afdf411c3b4a6876520f4c22193)\n\nI kinda got this idea in my head that AAPL is a company without much growth left and have been thinking about lightening up my position on it.\n\nSo I decided to make some graphs to figure out what to think and because pictures easy raw data hard. \n\nFirst off I was curious what apple's shares outstanding looked like. I know their buy back program is massive and I also know they're not growing top line revenue but are spending a ton on buybacks so this was a good place to start. Considering the share price has also been going up a lot and their market cap is massive so I thought buybacks might have a negligible effect. Wow was I wrong. The shares outstanding are down like 36% in ten years! I couldn't ask for a better looking chart. At this rate it'll all be bought back in like 18.9 more years.\n\nThen I was obviously curious about the EPS and decided to graph that. I was less surprised about how this turned out but it did still offer some insights. I hadn't seen before that they had multiple recent periods of EPS decline that they managed to turn around in big ways. And their EPS since covid is surprisingly down less than I thought so that's not so bad.\n\nIt doesn't change my opinion that their product lines are basically stagnant and not exactly innovative on a level that would spur a ton of growth, who tf needs another slimmer iPhone, iPad etc and I think that's a pretty widely held belief given the charts.\n\nHowever, it's pretty crazy to see that they've bought back a 3rd of their shares in the past 9 years. Also pretty wild to see how its EPS has grown despite not a lot of innovation.\n\nLastly I was curious how their wearables revenue was doing because I heard recently about the FDA approving AirPods to be hearing devices which is probably a huge market? IDK but what I do know is hearing aids are stupid expensive compared to $200 air pods so this could be big. So far it looks like wearables is doing about $9B a quarter so if growth in that picked up it could be meaningful\n\n[AAPL business segment revenue 2024 Q1-Q4](https://preview.redd.it/chcmjkylhj6e1.png?width=1980&format=png&auto=webp&s=bbbca8158c8b697ff8f97ccc847321d052c49118)\n\nAll in all I think I keep my position the same, especially considering most of it is through SPYG which has AAPL and NVDA nearly the same weights which kinda strikes me as a yin and yang sorta situation.\n\nPosition: long \\~$21,000 in shares",

    "selftext": "One might wonder how AAPL has managed to remain largely unaffected by the rapid rise of AI technology. Unlike the competitors, Apple doesn\u2019t seem to be actively showing as of today any developed LLM yet, just announcements. Meanwhile,  besides OpenAI, Google every other day is improvindg their Gemini, Microsoft has firmly planted its foot in the door with its heavy involvement in OpenAI. Third parties like Meta and Elon Musk have already into the LLM market as competitors. All in all, most released systems are already at the 2nd or 3rd generation, at least. Yet, nothing of the sort appears to be happening within Apple. Despite this, AAPL hasn\u2019t suffered any major setbacks; in fact, it has been steadily growing in recent years. What\u2019s keeping Apple from losing ground? What\u2019s your take on this?",

    "selftext": "Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co is in discussions with Nvidia Corp to produce its Blackwell artificial intelligence chips at the contract manufacturer's new plant in Arizona, three sources familiar with the matter said.\n\nTSMC is already making preparations to start production early next year, the sources said.\n\nNvidia's Blackwell chips, which the company unveiled in March, have so far been manufactured at TSMC's facilities in Taiwan. The company has seen high demand from customers involved in generative AI and accelerated computing for the chips, which it says is 30 times speedier at tasks like serving up answers from chatbots.\n\nThe agreement, if finalised, would secure another customer for TSMC's Arizona facility, which is scheduled to start volume production next year.\n\nTSMC and Nvidia declined to comment. The sources did not want to be identified as the talks were confidential.\n\nTwo of the sources said Apple (AAPL) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) are current customers at the Arizona plant. Apple and AMD did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nHowever, while TSMC plans to produce the front-end process of Nvidia's Blackwell chips in Arizona, the chips will still need to be shipped back to Taiwan for packaging. The Arizona facility does not have chip on wafer on substrate (CoWoS) capacity that is essential to the Blackwell chips, two of the sources said.\n\nAll of TSMC's CoWoS capacity is currently in Taiwan.\n\nTaiwan's TSMC, the world's largest contract chipmaker, is investing tens of billions of dollars in building three facilities in Phoenix and the project has won significant subsidies from the U.S. government which wants to bring semiconductor manufacturing back to the United States.\n\n*source: Yahoo!

    "selftext": "Does anyone have anymore information on Globalstar GSAT and Apple AAPL expanded partnership? Is GSAT a buy after the 40% rise in share price?.\n\nHere is some information I have , but is there anything I should be aware of ? \n\nThe expanded partnership between Globalstar (GSAT) and Apple (APL) could bring significant long-  term benefits to Globalstar's stock, though some challenges may stil lie ahead.  \nPotential Positive Impacts  I. Revenue Growth: With Apple prepaying up to $1.1 billion and committing to pay additional  service fees, Globalstar can expect substantial revenue growth. The agreement is projected to  more than double Globalstar's annual revenue compared to 2024 levels, primarily driven by the  new satellite network's capacity and performance milestones  2. Market Confidence: Apple's involvement and the substantial upfront payments provide market  validation for Globalstar, boosting investor confidence. A stronger association with Apple, along  with its 20% equity stake in Globalstar's satellite network, reinforces the viability and demand for  satellite-enabled connectivity, especially in remote and underserved areas\n3. Future Expansion Opportunities: The network's design and expanded ground infrastructure  allow Globalstar to potentially explore new revenue streams, including other high-reliability  C  industries (e.g., maritime or government sectors), beyond its arrangement with Apple cOwews  \nPotential Risks  \n1. High Dependency on Apple: The partners. p heavily ties Globalstar's growth trajectory to zero.\n3. Future Expansion Opportunities: The network's design and expanded ground infrastructure  allow Globalstar to potentially explore new revenue streams, including other high-reliability  industries (e.g. maritime or government sectors), beyond its arrangement with Apple.\nPotential Risks  \n1. High Dependency on Apple: The partnership heavily ties Globalstar's growth trajectory to  Apple's needs and future directions. If Apple shifts its strategic focus away from satellite  communication, Globalstar's revenue and stock could be negatively affected,  \n2. Execution Risks: Globalstar must deliver the new MSS network according to Apple's  performance milestones. Failing to meet these milestones could result in reduced or delayed  payments, which would likely impact the stock negatively.\nIn the near term, Globalstar's stock may experience heightened volatility, as its year-to-date  performance has already been variable. However, if Globalstar manages this partnership successfully.  it could see sustained growth, especially as satelite connectivity becomes increasingly relevant to  tech giants like Apple.\n",

    "title": "I Flipped My Entire Portfolio of ETFs for AI Stocks",
    "selftext": "Yesterday, I made a major shift in my stock portfolio. I used to rely on ETFs like SPY, QQQ, and SCHD, but now I\u2019ve sold most of them and focused on NVDA, MSFT, GOOGL, ISRG, AAPL, SCHG, and a bit of SOXX.\n\n - NVDA $237K\n\n - SCHG $121K\n\n - MSFT $105K\n\n - GOOGL $78K\n\n - AAPL $74K\n\n - ISRG $64K\n\n - SOXX $61K\n\n - BRK-B $47K\n\nHere\u2019s why: Right now, AI might feel limited to things like ChatGPT, but its potential goes far beyond that. Over the next 3, 5, or 10 years, AI is going to transform industries in ways we can\u2019t fully imagine yet. We\u2019re talking about healthcare revolutionizing how we diagnose and treat patients, transportation with autonomous vehicles and drones making logistics smarter and more efficient, and manufacturing, where AI will optimize production processes and supply chains.\n\nNow, I know what you're thinking: 'What, you think the world is full of cave dwellers? Who doesn't know that?' and you're right. Everyone knows AI techonology will be advanced and utilized in so many ways in the near future.\n\nBut look, you can think of it like real estate. Sure, property values rise while new highways or shopping centers are being built, but the real surge in value happens once people start using them and see the full benefits. Right now, AI is still in its \u201cunder construction\u201d phase\u2014people can imagine the future potential, but the true value hasn\u2019t been fully realized yet. The market has priced in expectations, sure, but once AI is fully integrated across industries and we start seeing its widespread, real-world impact, I believe we\u2019ll see another major surge in stock prices. What\u2019s priced in now is just the beginning\u2014the real growth will come as AI starts transforming daily life and business on a much larger scale.\n\nBefore ChatGPT went mainstream, people assumed \u2018just\u2019 that level of AI technology would arrive soon enough, but they didn\u2019t think it would have this much of an impact on stock prices once it came to life for the public. Everyone knew advanced AI was on the horizon, but the market didn\u2019t price it like they do now. This shows just how much underestimation happens until we truly start experiencing the technology firsthand. And that\u2019s why, despite what\u2019s already been priced in, I think AI stocks are still undervalued given the game-changing growth ahead. Anyone else rethinking their portfolio with AI at the center?",

    "selftext": "I tried to find modern examples to each attribute mentioned in Chapter 8 of One Up on Wall Street. Then I thought this community could find better fits and have fun together. So please share you candidates for any category below - maybe we discover hidden gems along the way.\n\nRECAP: Chapter 8 of One Up on Wall Street is  filled with fundamental yet profound strategies.  Invest in simple, easy-to-understand businesses over complex ones.  Identify undervalued companies with stable returns and less competition. And, search for as many of 13 attributes of the hypothetically \"perfect company.\" The dream attributes of such a company go as:\n\n***It Sounds Dull\u2014Or Even Better Ridiculous:***\n\nCompanies with unexciting or absurd names often go unnoticed and can be undervalued, providing excellent buying opportunities. Lynch highlights that these companies are typically engaged in simple, straightforward businesses and the duller the name, the better the prospects could be.\n\nMy examples: Duckhorn Portfolio (NAPA) & The Lovesac Company (LOVE)\n\n***It Does Something Dull:***\n\nCompanies engaged in mundane or straightforward businesses might not attract attention but often provide stable and increasing returns. Lynch appreciates companies that do boring things as they are less likely to be in the limelight and more likely to be undervalued.\n\nMy examples: Waste Management (WM) & Stepan Company (SCL)\n\n***It Does Something Disagreeable:***\n\nBusinesses involved in unpleasant industries (like waste management) are often overlooked. Their disagreeable nature keeps them under the radar of most investors, potentially leading to lower valuations and higher returns for those willing to invest in them.\n\nMy Examples: Altria Group (MO), cannabis companies and Caesars Entertainment (CZR)\n\n***It\u2019s a Spinoff:***\n\nCorporate spinoffs often result in profitable investment opportunities. Parent companies usually ensure that spinoffs have strong balance sheets and are well-positioned for success, leading to lucrative investments.\n\nFound a good website on this: [https://thezenofinvesting.com/recent-spinoffs/](https://thezenofinvesting.com/recent-spinoffs/)\n\n***The Institutions Don\u2019t Own It, and The Analysts Don\u2019t Follow It:***\n\nStocks with little to no institutional ownership and minimal analyst coverage can indicate untapped potential. These \"ignored\" stocks might offer significant opportunities for gains before they become mainstream.\n\nMy examples: Denny's Corporation (DENN) & Turtle Beach Corporation (HEAR)\n\n***The Rumors Abound: It\u2019s Involved with Toxic Waste and/or the Mafia:***\n\nLynch points out that companies involved in industries surrounded by rumors or negative perceptions, like waste management or alleged Mafia connections, can offer hidden value. The negative stigma leads to fewer investors and potentially lower valuations.\n\nMy examples: **Clean Harbors (CLH)** & Boyd Gaming (BYD)\n\n***There\u2019s Something Depressing About It:***\n\nCompanies operating in industries that deal with the less pleasant aspects of life, like funeral services, often have consistent demand and face little competition. They are typically ignored by the larger investing community, providing opportunities for higher returns.\n\nMy examples: Service Corporation International (SCI) & Matthews International Corporation (MATW)\n\n***It\u2019s a No-Growth Industry:***\n\nContrary to popular belief, Lynch prefers investing in low or no-growth industries as they tend to have less competition and more predictable business. The stability and predictability of such industries can lead to steady returns.\n\nMy examples: Consolidated Edison (ED) & American Water Works (AWK)\n\n***It\u2019s Got a Niche:***\n\nA strong niche market provides a company with a competitive edge and often a virtual monopoly in its area. Niche companies can control pricing and enjoy high barriers to entry for competitors, often leading to sustained profits\n\nMy examples: Idexx Laboratories (IDXX) & WD-40 Company (WDFC)\n\n***People Have to Keep Buying It:***\n\nLynch prefers investing in companies that make essential, habitual or addictive products like drugs, soft drinks, or cigarettes over those making fickle products, as continuous buying ensures steady business.\n\nMy examples: Procter & Gamble (PG) & Reckitt Benckiser (RBGLY)\n\n***It's a User of Technology:***\n\nCompanies that effectively utilize technology to reduce costs or enhance services are appealing. For example, a company benefiting from the technological price war, like Automatic Data Processing using cheaper computers to increase its profitability, is a better bet than the companies making the computers.\n\nMy examples: Walmart (WMT) & Domino\u2019s Pizza (DPZ)\n\n***The Insiders are Buyers:***\n\nInsider buying is a strong positive signal. If the people who know the company best are buying its stock, it's a good indication of confidence in the company's future. Lynch values insider buying as a sign that the company won't go bankrupt soon and that management is aligned with shareholders' interests.\n\nMy examples: Zoom Video Communications (ZM) & Carnival Corporation (CCL)\n\n***The Company is Buying Back Shares:***\n\nCompanies that buy back their own shares reduce the number of outstanding shares, which increases the value of the remaining shares. This action typically indicates the company believes its shares are undervalued and is a way to reward investors. Lynch sees share buybacks as a very positive move, often more beneficial than other use of capital like dividends or acquisitions\u200b.\n\nMy examples: Apple (AAPL) & Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B)",

    "title": "The Crash of the stock market has arrived. Price/Earnings ratio just broke 30 for the entire S&P 500. ",
    "selftext": "Almost 90 days ago I made a post in an alternate subreddit regarding why I believe the stock market will begin to crash within 120 days -- Essentially the crash will begin by the day before the election. I have included that entire post below -- and all of these reasons still remain relevant... Moreso than ever with the news from the Middle East today. Obviously the port strike is expediting things today. Nonetheless -- I think the post is super relevant, and for some reason, the moderators of WSB deleted the post after 6 hours, despite it receiving over 2.2 million views, and over 1100 shares. \n\nThe ride the market has been on, quite simply, has been insane.\n\nAccording to generally accepted wisdom -- by investing in the S&P 500, you can anticipate to double your money, on average, every 6.5 years. I'm not 100% certain as to why that's the accepted figure -- as calculating the last 14 6.5 year periods the average rate of return has been 64%.\n\nBelow is a chart of the average price/rate of return of GSPC (The S&P) over the last 14 cycles.. I couldn't easily find data prior to this..\n\n|Year|GSPC Price|6.5 year return on investment|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n||\n|1933.5|10.91||\n|1940|12.05|10.44%|\n|1946.5|18.43|52.95%|\n|1953|26.38|43.13%|\n|1959.5|58.68|122%|\n|1966|92.88|58%|\n|1972.5|107.14|15%|\n|1979|99.93|-7.22%|\n|1985.5|191.85|91.90%|\n|1992|408.78|113%|\n|1998.5|1133.84|177%|\n|2005|1181.27|4.10%|\n|2011.5|1320.64|11.70%|\n|2018|2471.65|87.10%|\n|2024.5|5525.29|123%|\n\nWhile the last two cycles don't necessarily ring any alarm bells -- we have just more than doubled, twice, looking at the last two cycles -- There is one massive, bloated, shit filled elephant in the room... Price to Earnings Ratio.\n\nHistorically, the Price to Earnings ratio for the S&P has sat just under 20 (the easiest data I could find puts it at 19.4x between 1974 and 2017 -- I'm not grabbing any arbitrary dates or numbers here). The Median value has it under 18x, and there have even been extended periods of time where it traded at +/- 10x.\n\nCurrently -- the P/E ratio sits at 28.71 -- roughly 150% of what is normal.\n\nIn the history of the S&P, the P/E ratio has hit this level only 3 times...\n\n* Immediately preceding, and then during, the Dot Com Bubble (P/E broke 30 +/- April 2001).\n* Immediately preceding, and then during, the Global Financial Crisis (P/E broke 30 +/- October 2008).\n* The quarter after Covid hit. (P/E broke 30 +/- March 2020).\n\nImages aren't allowed in this subreddit -- but if you go to the multpl website you will see we finished trading yesterday, 09/30, at a P/E of 30.07\n\nHistorically -- what has happened to the markets after crossing this mark? In all three scenarios, by the time we crossed a P/E of 30, the dam had already started to break.\n\n* During the Dot Com bubble, the S&P 500 was already down 19% from its highs, and would fall another 34% before finally starting to recover. By the the time the bleeding stopped, it had lost 47% of its value.\n* During the global financial crisis, an almost identical story can be told. The S&P had lost 18% of its value by time P/E broke 30, and when it finally bottomed out in February of 2009, it lost 53% of its total value.\n* Covid, obviously, was a much quicker recovery... as we only fell 32%, and had bounced back in less than 6 months time (reason for which outlined later).\n\n**Okay -- so**\u00a0***Maybe***\u00a0**we have a price to earnings ratio problem, but you're still not sold. What else do we have going on?**\n\nOutside of the fact that I firmly believe that the market is overvalued today, I think there are several other major issues that we are facing in the current environment -- and while I could write a diatribe for each, for purposes of succinctness, I'll simply outline them via bullet points below.\n\n* Credit card debt is at an all time high, and outside of a brief period after Covid checks arrived, has been rising since 2013.\n* Younger Americans are in the most trouble with credit card debt. As boomers continue to retire, it will be the working class most disproportionately affected.\n* Credit card delinquency rates are the highest they've been since 2011.\n* Auto loans debt and average auto loan payments are the highest they've been at any point in history. Auto loan delinquency rates are the highest they've been since 2010.\n* The stock market is insanely top heavy right now. The Magnificent 7 (Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), and Tesla (TSLA)) now account for 45% of the entire value of the Nasdaq. They account for roughly 30% of the entire stock market combined. As of today -- they are trading at a combined P/E of 42x. A correction in these 7 companies would be absolutely catastrophic for the entire market as a whole.\n* We are starting to see a weakening of the labor market. Furthermore -- I do not believe the jobs numbers are entirely as they seem. I think many of the jobs 'added' over the last 18 months have been individuals picking up second jobs to help make ends meet. Any reasonable increase in the unemployment rate have absolutely massive consequences.\n* Many banks are holding on to massive unrealized losses. While this has the potential to hit the regional banks the worst, some of the largest banks -- including Bank of America, Charles Schwab, and USAA have unbooked security losses that are greater than 50% of their equity capital.\n* Regional banks are at risk due to the massive amounts of US treasury notes they hold that were bought during Covid. In short -- nobody was borrowing money to buy homes or cars. Banks, flush with cash, took said money and bought US T notes with this money so they could earn some interest on it. This was at a time when interest rates were very low. Now that interest rates are high -- demand for these old t notes is essentially non existent, as you buy new t notes that pay a much higher rate of return. If any sort of bank run starts, these banks will be forced to liquidate said t-bills, and they will have to sell them at a loss. If too many people do this simultaneously, the bank will become insolvent -- like what we saw happen with Silicon Valley bank, Signature Bank and First Republic Bank. (Side note -- the failure of these three banks alone was larger than the combined total of bank failures in 2008 during the global financial crisis).\n* The US government still has a spending problem. Our deficit has grown by $500 million since I started writing this an hour ago.\n* Global tensions are high -- and rising. Massive protests are erupting all over Europe.\n* The US is involved in two proxy wars that don't appear as if they will abate any time soon.\n* The political division in the US is as dramatic as I've seen it at any point in my existence. Perhaps those older and wiser than me can chime in here -- but it seems most are resorting to tribal, identity politics split down party lines.\n* Commercial real estate is starting to buckle. Covid brought about work from home, and with many offices retaining those practices, or allowing partial work from home, office space supply far outpaces demand. This problem is exacerbated by high interest rates. Most commercial loans are done on 5 or 7 year balloon. When that balloon is bout to come due, the owner of that property will refinance the loan, restarting the 5 or 7 year period to avoid paying off the balance owed on the property. Many of these property owners that refinanced into low interest rates in 2020, during covid, when rates bottomed out -- are now having to get a new loan to keep from paying their balloon. However, with interest rates more than twice what they were several years ago, and vacancy rates skyrocketing, many of these real estate owners will not be able to pay the monthly mortgage on their buildings. Commercial Real Estate foreclosures jumped 117% in March alone.\n* Housing has become increasingly less affordable for many Americans. For 2022 -- the most recent year I could find data -- a family earning the median US household income, renting a median priced US home, was spending 40% of their income on rent.\n* Countries are abandoning the US dollar in droves.\n\nI believe some of these issues, on their own, are enough to cause serious economic turmoil. Bundled together, I don't see how we aren't in for a very rude awakening.\n\n**This economic downturn may be severe.**\n\nIn the three times this has happened before -- the action, or lake thereof varied dramatically. During scenario one -- the dot com bubble -- the government largely just let the companies fail. While I was only 11 at the time, my understanding is that there really were no bailouts here because the only people really hurt were the investors in those companies -- unlike scenario two. During the GFC, shuttering banks would have resulted in a complete collapse of the US (and really global) financial system. While I won't get into partisan politics, I'm of the belief that the covid bailouts were entirely unnecessary -- and more importantly for this post -- the reason that the upcoming crash is going to be so insanely problematic.\n\n**Bailouts on any level, whether to companies, banks, or directly to citizens, will inevitably increase inflation. I don't think they are on the table for this correction.**\n\nPeople have painted the inflation problem as a result of supply chain issues... And while supply chain issues didn't help, I think the bigger issue, by far, was the sheer amount of money we printed. You cannot make $4 trillion appear out of thin air and expect that every dollar in circulation isn't going to suddenly become worth less money. We just lived through this reality after the Covid printing.\n\nThis will largely tie the feds hands. Print more money -- we find ourselves in a cycle of ever increasing prices and higher interest rates.\n\n**What happens from here?**\n\nI don't know. Don't listen to me. I'm an idiot. Stock market will probably just continue to go up. I'm probably wrong about 100% of this.\n\nThe prediction in bold below is what I posted 90 days ago. I now believe the top is officially in -- that we won't see another ATH for a long time. \n\n**My Prediction? GSPC/SPY cruise up a tiny bit further, to +/- $5900/$590 -- before retreating to $3500/$350 by 12/2025.**\n\nMy positions: \n\nBought 50 $570 10/2 puts at open this morning right at open. I'm up about 18k on them.   \nBought 12 $565 10/1 puts at 9:30 CST. I am up about $80 on them.   \nBought 35 UVXY $42 Calls exp 10/4 at about 10AM CST. I'm up about $80 on them.   \nHolding 359 $BITO Calls with a 1/17/25 Expiration.   \nHolding 7 $450 SPY P with an exp of 9/19/25, and 5 QQQ $400P exp 6/30/25",

Even when it was trading at ATH's it had a price/FCF of 4.5 which to me still seems like a screaming buy. Given the recent china stimulus and runup of baba, I think it should still be a buy right as chinese consumers get this stimulus and baba should benefit? Am I wrong here? Are there risks I'm ignoring?",

    "selftext": "# Good Monday morning traders and investors of the r/stocks sub! Welcome to the new trading week and a fresh start! Here are your pre-market stock movers & news on this Monday, September 16th, 2024-\n\n*****\n\n# [Stock futures are little changed as investors await major Fed decision: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/15/stock-futures-are-little-changed-as-investors-await-major-fed-decision-live-updates.html)\n*****\n> Stock futures were little changed Monday morning as investors await the Federal Reserve\u2019s highly anticipated policy meeting, during which central bankers are expected to cut rates for the first time since 2020.\n*****\n> S&P 500 futures slipped less than 0.4%, while futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 104 points, or 0.2%. Meanwhile, Nasdaq-100 futures pulled back 0.3%.\n*****\n> Apple shares fell more than 2% in early trading after analysts at firms, including Bank of America and JPMorgan, noted that shipping times could point to lighter demand for iPhone 16 Pro models than the prior year.\n*****\n> The S&P 500 is less than 1% away from its July record and could notch a new all-time high this week. After a rough start to a historically weak September, the three major U.S. indexes ended last week\u2019s trading session in the green, with the S&P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite just closing their best week of 2024.\n*****\n> The Fed is set to meet on Tuesday and Wednesday and are widely anticipated to make their first interest rate cut since they began hiking rates in March 2022. A cut this week would be a pivotal move, as many investors hope the decision could lower borrowing costs for companies and improve overall earnings growth \u2014 boosting economic growth.\n*****\n> The overnight lending rate is currently at 5.25% to 5.5%. Traders are split on whether the central bank will cut rates by 25 or 50 basis points, per the CME Group\u2019s FedWatch tool.\n*****\n> Stocks typically post strong gains during cycles where initial rate cuts are able to sustain economic expansion, BMO Capital chief investment strategist Brian Belski said.\n*****\n> \u201cSo long as nothing breaks in the economy, U.S. stocks remain firmly within a bull market, but with significantly strong trailing one-year performance headed into this initial rate cut, future gains are likely to be more muted relative to historical norms, in our view,\u201d he said in a Friday note ahead.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#LAST WEEK'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR LAST WEEK'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/JeXzAYR.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#LAST WEEK'S S&P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR LAST WEEK'S S&P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Md5UMKo.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/sVxpfGU.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/G9jtrZ5.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/fqLKXyh.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/L4mNSBX.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/uKAl54m.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/WZb12Gv.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS AFTERNOON'S AFTER-HOURS EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/BJzVcBV.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/Gc325TT.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#FRIDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/qMjgcOp.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#FRIDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/0k12aGQ.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/E9zVA8r.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/z9ng4cU.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/FYLfnGf.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/nPDYney.png)**)\n\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/16/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-premarket-mu-aapl-intc-aa-more.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n> **Trump Media & Technology** \u2014 Shares rose more than 1%, extending the 11% gain from Friday.

    "selftext": "#Good morning traders and investors of the r/stocks sub! Welcome to the new trading day and a fresh start! Here are your pre-market stock movers & news on this Tuesday, September the 10th, 2024-\n\n*****\n\n# [Stock futures are flat as September sluggishness continues, traders await inflation data: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/09/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)\n\n*****\n> Stock futures were mostly flat Tuesday after the major averages rebounded from their worst week in 2024.\n*****\n> Futures tied to the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures each added about 0.1%. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures dipped 16 points, or less than 0.1%.\n*****\n> Cloud platform company Oracle surged about 8% after posting fiscal first-quarter results that topped expectations. Oracle also announced a partnership with Amazon Web Services to provide database services.\n*****\n> On Monday, the three major averages made a sharp comeback after posting their worst week this year as investors bought the dip. The S&P 500 popped 1.16% to snap a four-day run of losses and post its first winning day in September. The Nasdaq Composite also closed 1.16% higher, aided by a jump in Nvidia. The Dow climbed 484 points, or 1.2%.\n*****\n> These moves come as investors bet that a widely anticipated interest rate cut at the Federal Reserve\u2019s Sept. 17-18 meeting could help assuage concerns over a weakening economy. August\u2019s payrolls report, which came out last Friday, reflected growth of 142,000, below economists\u2019 expectations.

However I'm not able to update the post title, so I'm putting this update on the front here \n\nI'm sharing this old idea I had more than a decade ago. I bought AAPL around 2012. Then for several years, I would look daily at it's stock price. One day i noticed that if I bought AAPL at 9am ET on Monday morning then sell at 9.30am ET, I could possibly make a profit, at least on days where the market would not be doom and gloomy.\nDoing it daily and compounding the profits, I'd end up possibly rich, at least based on a quick calculation I did in either 2014 or 2015  with a subset of data ranging forabout a quarter length...\n\nThat's it, easy right, little risk, hence a possible arbitrage:\nBuy AAPL at 9 on Monday, sell it at 9.30.\n\nBut I never executed the idea as I didn't want to get into the active trading thing.\nFast forward now in 2024, I'm wondering if it  was a great idea?\nI don't have access to my Bloomberg anymore and don't have time to run numbers. Maybe it's an old well known idea among traders and I'm not the first one who thought about it. \nMaybe it's still a valid trade, maybe there are other stocks who would enjoy the Monday morning effect or kick.\nI have no idea.\nBut I wanted to share it here to all the experts to get some insights.\nFeel free to use it if you can make a buck out of it. If you become rich and reach the moon, don't forget me :).\nCheers.\n",

    "title": "[Reuters Exclusive] Intel manufacturing business suffers setback as Broadcom tests disappoint",
    "selftext": "Sept 4 (Reuters) - Intel's (INTC.O), contract manufacturing business has suffered a setback after tests with chipmaker Broadcom (AVGO.O), failed, three sources familiar with the matter told Reuters, dealing a blow to the company's turnaround efforts.\n\nThe tests conducted by Broadcom involved sending silicon wafers - the foot-wide discs on which chips are printed - through Intel's most advanced manufacturing process known as 18A, the sources said. Broadcom received the wafers back from Intel last month. After its engineers and executives studied the results, the company concluded the manufacturing process is not yet viable to move to high-volume production.\n\nReuters could not determine the current relationship between Broadcom and Intel or whether Broadcom had decided to walk away from a potential manufacturing deal.\n\n\"Intel 18A is powered on, healthy and yielding well, and we remain fully on track to begin high volume manufacturing next year,\" an Intel spokesperson said in a statement. \"There is a great deal of interest in Intel 18A across the industry but, as a matter of policy, we do not comment on specific customer conversations.\"\n\nA Broadcom spokesperson said the company is \"evaluating the product and service offerings of Intel Foundry and have not concluded that evaluation.\"\n\nIntel's contract manufacturing business was launched in 2021 as a key part of Chief Executive Pat Gelsinger's turnaround strategy.\n\nBroadcom is not a household name but makes crucial networking gear and radio chips that helped generate $28 billion in overall chip sales in its last fiscal year. It has benefited from the boom in spending on artificial intelligence hardware, and J.P. Morgan analyst Harlan Sur estimated it will bank $11 billion to $12 billion from AI this year, up from $4 billion last year.\n\nSome of its chip sales are from agreements with companies such as Alphabet's (GOOGL.O), Google and Meta Platforms (META.O), to help produce in-house AI processors, which can include arrangements with a manufacturer, such as Intel or Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (2330.TW),.\n\n**CRUCIAL SETBACK**\n\nAs part of a disastrous second-quarter earnings report that shaved more than a quarter from the company's market value, Intel announced a 15% job cut and a reduction in capital spending related to its factory construction. Gelsinger and other executives will present a plan to the board of directors in mid-September on possible cuts to business units and teams to reduce costs, Reuters reported on Sunday.\n\nIntel has committed to about $100 billion of expansion and new factory construction at several sites in the U.S. A crucial part of the company's expansion includes attracting big customers such as Nvidia (NVDA.O), or Apple (AAPL.O), to fill up capacity at all its new sites.\n\nIntel reported a $7 billion operating loss for the foundry business, wider than the $5.2 billion in losses the year earlier. Executives expect the contract chip business to achieve breakeven in 2027.\n\nTypically fabricating an advanced chip requires more than 1,000 separate steps inside a chip factory, or fab, and takes roughly three months to complete. Production success is determined by the number of working chips on each silicon wafer. Achieving a substantial yield is crucial to move to producing the tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of wafers demanded by big chip designers.\n\nBroadcom's engineers had concerns with the viability of the process, the sources said. Typically that refers to the number of defects on each wafer or the quality of the chips fabricated.\n\nFor an advanced manufacturing process used by TSMC, the Taiwanese giant charges roughly $23,000 per wafer at high volume, according to two sources familiar with wafer pricing. Reuters could not determine Intel's wafer pricing.\n\nTSMC declined to comment on its wafer pricing.\n\nMoving a chip design from a manufacturing process used by a company such as TSMC to another vendor such as Samsung (005930.KS), or Intel can take months and requires dozens of engineers, depending on the complexity of the chip and the differences in manufacturing technology.\n\nBetting on a new manufacturing process such as Intel's 18A is impossible for some smaller chip companies because doing so would require resources they do not have.\n\nIntel released its manufacturing tool kit for its 18A process to other chipmakers over the summer, Gelsinger said on an earnings call last month.\n\nThe company plans to be \"manufacturing-ready\" by the end of this year for its own chips and begin high volume production for external customers in 2025, Gelsinger said. At an investor conference last week, he said there are a dozen customers \"actively engaged\" with the tool kit.\n\nhttps://www.reuters.com/technology/intel-manufacturing-business-suffers-setback-broadcom-tests-disappoint-sources-2024-09-04/",

    "selftext": "I've been experimenting text based GPT from OpenAI's ChatGPT to Google Bard to now Gemini AI.\n\nSince late '22 when the world was caught in attention on the magic of ChatGPT, people have been flocking to buy the next best accelerator cards (Nvidia), hoping they can be the next one to come out with the killer app - that ambitious goal to reach AGI first.\n\nIt's only up until very recently that I was made known that Gemini AI is entirely trained on Google custom TPU. I read a little about it (I found that TPU discussion is very little over here) and found that in the earlier days since Alexnet deep learning approach back to 2012.\n\nPrevious generalized computing (thank you Intel Xeon) tries to cope with big data workload. Accelerators were found to be particularly efficient in those machine learning workload. Early exploration by Google on designing custom TPU for themselves so they can have more flexibility catering to specific workloads. This decision alone turns out to be very valuable in today's Gen AI era.\n\nWith recent news from Apple that they have been training their AI models with Google's TPU, also the performance of Gemini AI to be on par with industry leading ChatGPT (heard that Antropic's Sonnet is even better - but Gemini is really good enough for my daily use).\n\nThese observations make strong statements to the Gen AI community, i.e.,  you can bypass Nvidia and still perform adequately well (even supercede for some reports) in your AI product offering.\n\nThe fact that Google does not hoard all its computing power to its own Gemini training, and the ability to extend its compute to customers like AAPL speak volume on the native TPU effectiveness.\n\nCost and time wise, Google is the prime candidate in AI era as TPU helps smoothen out the training cost. With ads revenue fueling the AI training (heard that OpenAI now needs more money), and superior TPU working natively, I'm of the opinion that Google will create a lot of value many years from now.",

    "title": "Apple sales rise 5%, topping estimates as iPad and Services revenue jump",
    "selftext": "Apple reported fiscal third-quarter earnings on Thursday that beat Wall Street expectations, with overall revenue rising 5%.  \n\nHere\u2019s how Apple did versus LSEG consensus estimates for the quarter ended June 29: \n\nEPS: $1.40 vs. $1.35 estimated\n \nRevenue: $85.78 billion vs. $84.53 billion estimated \n\niPhone revenue: $39.30 billion vs. $38.81 billion estimated \n\nMac revenue: $7.01 billion vs. $7.02 billion estimated \n\niPad revenue: $7.16 billion vs. $6.61 billion estimated \n\nWearables, Home, and Accessories revenue: $8.10 billion vs. $7.79 billion estimated \n\nServices revenue: $24.21 billion vs. $24.01 billion estimated \n\nGross margin: 46.3% vs. 46.1% estimated \n\nApple did not provide formal guidance, although CEO Tim Cook and CFO Luca Maestri often share information about the current quarter on a call with analysts.  \n\nApple reported $21.44 billion in net income during the quarter, versus $19.88 billion in the year-ago period.  \n\nApple\u2019s most important business remains the iPhone, which accounted for about 46% of the company\u2019s total sales during the quarter. While Apple beat LSEG estimates, the product line still declined about 1% on an annual basis to $39.29 billion in revenue.  \n\n\u201cOn a constant currency basis, we grew year on year. And so that\u2019s sort of how we look at it from an operational point of view,\u201d Apple CEO Tim Cook told CNBC\u2019s Steve Kovach.  \n\nCook said that while Apple doesn\u2019t know about the positive sales impact from its newly announced Apple Intelligence service until it starts shipping to customers later this fall, he said that Apple had been increasing spending to get the service ready.  \n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019ve done is we\u2019ve redeployed a lot of people on to AI that were working on other things,\u201d Cook said. \u201cFrom a data center point of view, as you know, we have a hybrid approach. So we both have our own and we partner with people. And so that capex would be in the partners\u2019 financials, and we would be paying expense.\u201d \n\n\u201cCertainly embedded in our results this quarter is an increase year over year in the amount we\u2019re spending for AI and Apple intelligence,\u201d Cook continued.  \n\nApple showed strongest growth in its iPad division, which grew nearly 24% year-over-year to $7.16 billion in sales. Apple released new iPads during the quarter for the first time since 2022, which spurred a wave of upgrades. \n\nCook said that about half of iPad buyers haven\u2019t owned one before, suggesting the tablet market is not yet saturated. \n\nApple\u2019s Mac division reported $7 billion in sales, up about 2% from the year-ago quarter.  \n\nApple Watch sales, headphones such as Beats or AirPods, and HomePod home speakers are reported under \u201cWearables, Home, and Accessories.\u201d Sales in the catch-all category declined 2% to $8.10 billion during the quarter.  \n\n\u201cA whopping two thirds of the Apple Watch buyers were new to the product. So, we\u2019re still growing that base significantly,\u201d Cook said.  \n\nThe Services business is most important growth category for Apple and includes hardware warranties, revenue from Google, monthly cloud storage subscriptions, and the company\u2019s content subscriptions, such as Apple TV+. The company reported $24.21 billion in Services sales, up 14% and in-line with Apple\u2019s forecast and LSEG estimates. \n\nApple said in a statement that it had more active devices in each of its regions than it ever had before, without providing a specific number. Apple\u2019s active device count is important because it signifies a group of existing Apple customers to which it can sell its profitable services. Apple said in February that it had 2.2 billion active devices.  \n\nApple said it had 1 billion paid subscriptions, which includes subscriptions to iPhone apps through Apple\u2019s App Store.  \n\nHowever, Apple sales declined 6% to $14.72 billion in greater China, a region that also includes Taiwan and Hong Kong. Apple is under pressure in mainland China as local rivals such as Huawei introduce competing products.  \n\n\u201cMainland China and Greater China actually had a record in the iPhone install base,\u201d Cook said. \u201cKantar tells us we had the top three selling smartphones in urban China and the results in China represent an acceleration from the first half of the year.\u201d \n\nApple said it spent $32 billion on dividends and share repurchases during the quarter. \n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/01/apple-aapl-earnings-report-q3-2024.html",

    "title": "Analyzing the Analysts: Using average analyst price target to identify buying opportunities amongst the top 100 companies in the S&P",
    "selftext": "Hello everyone,\n\nI'm a lazy investor and don't like to do much due diligence, but I do like to make money. Unfortunately these two things about me are often at odds as I've lost money in the past for not doing my DD. As such, I continue to be lazy but I try and find ways to work around doing due diligence and hopefully finding loop holes.\n\nOne such way that I have been thinking about recently is using analyst ratings, reviews and price targets as a surrogate for due diligence. In essence, I try to just have these analysts do the work for me. The idea is that much in the same way that with those who believe in technical analysis hold that everything you need to know about a stock is baked into it's price action, and so when something good happens the stock price goes up and when something bad happens the stock price goes down, thus all you need is to analyze trends in stock price and you'll be analyzing everything about the stock by proxy, I have a thesis (or theory) that perhaps you can do the same or something similar with analyst price targets of companies.\n\nNow I know that anyone who has read this far already thinks I'm an idiot. Many experienced individual investors probably find market analysts to be stupid and therefore I'm stupid for following their lead, but I would argue to the contrary for a few reasons. As much as I have put in a lot of effort to learn about how the market operates (been investing for the last 6 years, started learning actively about it as much as I could a couple years prior to that), there is still much I don't know as I don't have a finance or economics degree. Moreover, as bad as you may think an analyst is, they are at least competent enough to keep their job as an analyst at the investment firm that allows them to make stock price target selections. Lastly, and most importantly, what I am about to discuss below uses the aggregate of numerous analyst price targets so I'm not relying on a single analyst, but several (probably between 10 and 40 per company). I think if two-dozen analysts are strongly in favor of a company, it is unlikely that my novice investor wisdom would have researched the company and found a flaw that they all missed.\n\nSo what I did yesterday evening was go through the top 100 S&P 500 companies by market cap and find the current average price target for them on Yahoo Finance. I then divided the current stock price (at the close on 7/31) by that price target and expressed it as a percentage to see how far off the company was from the average price target analysts were aiming for. Then I also listed how many total ratings each company had, and how many of them were 'Strong Buys' and 'Buys'.\n\nThis yielded the following table:\n\n|+|A|B|C|D|E|F|G|H|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|1|Company|Current Price|Price Target|Percent to Target|Total Ratings|# Strong Buy Ratings|# Buy Ratings|% of Ratings that were Strong Buys|\n|2|AAPL|222.08|209.76|105.87%|38|11|21|28.95%|\n|3|MSFT|418.35|459.66|91.01%|34|14|13|41.18%|\n|4|NVDA|117.02|125.69|93.10%|38|14|15|36.84%|\n|5|AMZN|186.98|206.43|90.58%|47|15|28|31.91%|\n|6|META|474.83|490.04|96.90%|63|21|34|33.33%|\n|7|GOOG|173.15|185.45|93.37%|5|0|3|0.00%|\n|8|BRK.B|438.5|441.47|99.33%|6|1|3|16.67%|\n|9|LLY|804.27|817.03|98.44%|22|9|8|40.91%|\n|10|AVGO|160.68|180.62|88.96%|29|10|17|34.48%|\n|11|JPM|212.8|200.66|106.05%|28|9|13|32.14%|\n|12|TSLA|232.07|189.09|122.73%|23|0|0|0.00%|\n|13|UNH|576.16|569.6|101.15%|22|11|11|50.00%|\n|14|XOM|118.59|122.83|96.55%|25|5|11|20.00%|\n|15|V|265.67|282.26|94.12%|39|13|22|33.33%|\n|16|JNJ|157.85|158.53|99.57%|23|4|8|17.39%|\n|17|PG|160.76|161.5|99.54%|22|6|4|27.27%|\n|18|MA|463.71|474.87|97.65%|39|14|20|35.90%|\n|19|HD|368.16|355.97|103.42%|33|12|12|36.36%|\n|20|COST|822|886.84|92.69%|29|7|11|24.14%|\n|21|WMT|68.64|68.29|100.51%|32|8|7|25.00%|\n|22|MRK|113.13|132.14|85.61%|21|4|7|19.05%|\n|23|BAC|40.31|41.95|96.09%|30|6|16|20.00%|\n|24|CVX|160.47|167.84|95.61%|24|6|10|25.00%|\n|25|NFLX|628.35|640.43|98.11%|41|11|14|26.83%|\n|26|KO|66.74|64.8|102.99%|25|5|7|20.00%|\n|27|CRM|258.8|274.18|94.39%|45|16|25|35.56%|\n|28|ADBE|551.65|566.58|97.36%|31|11|14|35.48%|\n|29|PEP|172.67|168.65|102.38%|22|10|10|45.45%|\n|30|TMO|613.34|629.42|97.45%|15|8|6|53.33%|\n|31|AMD|144.48|175.48|82.33%|31| | |0.00%|\n|32|LIN|453.5|475.32|95.41%| | | |#DIV/0!|\n|33|ORCL|139.45|140.03|99.59%|36|10|16|27.78%|\n|34|WFC|59.34|59.8|99.23%|31|4|8|12.90%|\n|35|ACN|330.62|348.01|95.00%|29|7|9|24.14%|\n|36|CSCO|48.45|50.56|95.83%|27|8|11|29.63%|\n|37|MCD|265.4|276.47|96.00%|33|8|15|24.24%|\n|38|QCOM|180.95|191.24|94.62%|23|2|7|8.70%|\n|39|GE|170.2|171.93|98.99%|17|5| |29.41%|\n|40|ABT|105.94|124.37|85.18%|20|7|6|35.00%|\n|41|TXN|203.81|187.18|108.88%|32|6|8|18.75%|\n|42|DHR|277.08|284.09|97.53%|17|7|6|41.18%|\n|43|AMGN|332.47|320.24|103.82%|25|3|7|12.00%|\n|44|INTU|647.35|711.36|91.00%|22|6|3|27.27%|\n|45|PM|115.16|115.74|99.50%|18|2|7|11.11%|\n|46|PFE|30.54|29.38|103.95%|22|2|11|9.09%|\n|47|IBM|192.14|172.59|111.33%|25|4|4|16.00%|\n|48|DIS|93.69|123.11|76.10%|30|5|10|16.67%|\n|49|VZ|40.52|45.6|88.86%|32|2|6|6.25%|\n|50|CAT|346.2|337.62|102.54%|24|4|7|16.67%|\n|51|NOW|814.39|807.1|100.90%|34|13|17|38.24%|\n|52|AMAT|212.2|248.8|85.29%|21|4|15|19.05%|\n|53|GS|509.03|476.64|106.80%|27|4|7|14.81%|\n|54|CMCSA|41.27|46.36|89.02%|31|12|18|38.71%|\n|55|SPGI|484.73|521.39|92.97%|15|1|9|6.67%|\n|56|RTX|117.49|103.93|113.05%| | | |#DIV/0!|\n|57|ISRG|444.61|471.87|94.22%|17|6|5|35.29%|\n|58|NEE|76.39|80.23|95.21%|15|5|8|33.33%|\n|59|UNP|246.73|242.11|101.91%|29|5|7|17.24%|\n|60|AXP|253.04|253.26|99.91%|28|6|4|21.43%|\n|61|LOW|245.51|250.99|97.82%|32|8|10|25.00%|\n|62|T|19.25|19.3|99.74%|30|6|3|20.00%|\n|63|HON|204.75|226.96|90.21%|20|7|9|35.00%|\n|64|UBER|64.47|79.96|80.63%| | | |#DIV/0!|\n|65|VRTX|495.72|483.91|102.44%|27|10|12|37.04%|\n|66|MS|103.21|105.64|97.70%|27|3|14|11.11%|\n|67|TJX|113.02|107.04|105.59%|27|9|14|33.33%|\n|68|INTC|30.74|38.02|80.85%|41| |18|0.00%|\n|69|BKNG|3715.01|4192.39|88.61%| | | |#DIV/0!|\n|70|PGR|214.12|237.47|90.17%|19|5|4|26.32%|\n|71|C|64.88|71.01|91.37%|29|5|12|17.24%|\n|72|ELV|532.03|599.13|88.80%| | | |#DIV/0!|\n|73|BLK|876.5|936.85|93.56%|15|3|9|20.00%|\n|74|PLD|126.05|135.68|92.90%|18|4|8|22.22%|\n|75|LMT|541.92|535.31|101.23%|22|7| |31.82%|\n|76|ETN|304.79|345.86|88.13%|24|3|4|12.50%|\n|77|REGN|1079.19|1104.34|97.72%|26|7|6|26.92%|\n|78|MU|109.82|174.41|62.97%|31|8|20|25.81%|\n|79|CB|275.66|277.84|99.22%|19|5|11|26.32%|\n|80|SYK|327.45|378.81|86.44%|27|11|6|40.74%|\n|81|ADI|231.38|255.84|90.44%|26|6|10|23.08%|\n|82|LRCX|921.24|1041.75|88.43%|19|3|12|15.79%|\n|83|MMC|222.57|223.48|99.59%|19|4|7|21.05%|\n|84|BSX|73.88|87.57|84.37%|24|10|8|41.67%|\n|85|MDT|80.32|92.43|86.90%|23|4|7|17.39%|\n|86|BA|190.6|219.35|86.89%|25|7|7|28.00%|\n|87|ADP|262.62|264.65|99.23%|18|1|1|5.56%|\n|88|AMT|220.4|230.39|95.66%|22|7|14|31.82%|\n|89|PANW|324.73|343.43|94.55%|41|13|16|31.71%|\n|90|KLAC|823.07|868.07|94.82%|14|2|4|14.29%|\n|91|BX|142.15|135.47|104.93%|14|6|6|42.86%|\n|92|CI|348.67|393.25|88.66%|17|6|7|35.29%|\n|93|BMY|47.56|50.47|94.23%|22|5|4|22.73%|\n|94|GILD|76.06|81.02|93.88%|28|2|11|7.14%|\n|95|SCHW|65.19|73.89|88.23%|19|5|9|26.32%|\n|96|DE|371.98|422.99|87.94%|22|4|3|18.18%|\n|97|FI|163.57|177.14|92.34%|19|1|2|5.26%|\n|98|UPS|130.37|144.61|90.15%|26|3|2|11.54%|\n|99|SO|83.52|79.51|105.04%|17|1|4|5.88%|\n|100|TMUS|182.28|197.95|92.08%|30|7|16|23.33%|\n|101|COP|111.2|141.51|78.58%|21|6|9|28.57%|\n\n\nBased on this table above, I tried to identify some companies that met a few criteria. I wanted to identify companies that had at least 25% of their analyst ratings be 'Strong Buys', to have at least 20 analyst ratings available and for the current stock price to be at 90% or less of the average price target. This lead me to the following 11 companies:\n**Micron Technologies (MU), Boston Scientific (BSX), Abbot Laboratories (ABT), Merck Scientific (MRK), Stryker (SYK), The Cigna Group (CI), Broadcom (AVGO), Comcast (CMCSA), Honeywell International (HON), Analogue Devices (ADI), and Intuit Inc. (INTU)**\n\nI have about $5,000 I'd like to invest right now and I have half a mind to just put it equally weighted into these 11 companies and just watch it for the next year or two. I'll either do that or put it all in VOO, but I have a feeling that these 11 companies might beat the S&P 500 over the next 24 months.\n\nWhat do you guys think?",

    "selftext": "I was researching the difference between total outstanding shares vs float, and apparently most companies do not exclude instituional shares from float because they are traded on exchanges as well. My example is Apple, which despite having 57.59% institutionally owned shares its float is 15.31b of its 15.33b shares. What I don\u2019t understand, however, is how it says 5.22% of shares are owned by insiders, which I thought was not included in public float calculation. However the float is 99.8%, not 94.78% or whatever; so clearly at least the vast majority of these shares are counted. Is it only certain restricted shares that are not counted? Also the only article I could really find on this on titan.com said some companies calculate institutional shares as part of public float, some don\u2019t. Are there any examples of some that don\u2019t? Thanks in advance.\n\nLinks:\n\nhttps://www.titan.com/articles/what-is-a-low-float-stock#:~:text=About%2058%25%20of%20Apple's%20shares,at%20about%20840%20million%20shares.\n\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/key-statistics/\n",

    "selftext": "I got to try Microsoft's copilot this week and i have to say i was underwhelmed by what it had to offer. It just felt like an enhancement for windows with more features, nothing ground breaking. This wasn't a major leap in technology like going from fax's to email. Tech companies releasing new (free)upgrades and new (free)products is like Nike releasing a new pair of shoes, just something else to add to the lineup. Will it make SOME peoples jobs more efficient, yes. Is it applicable for most people, i have to say no. Nike makes shoes for athletes but maybe 1-2% actually use them for what its intended for. Lets say a company has 20,000 employees, of those employees how many need it for their role or will using it on a daily basis? Maybe 90 % wont. If that's accurate a company will only pay for the 10% that need a user license.\n\nIf chat GPT was never released all the mag 7 earnings would still be about the same without it.\n\nNow for the overvalued and overbought. MSFT has a PE of 40, one of the highest of all the mag 7. Your paying $40 for every dollar they earn. Based on their current AI stack im not sure they will be able to beat the current expectations in a big way consistently. MSFT is not NVDA. NVDA chips cost $30k+ each, as much as a low end Tesla. Copilot has a free version and the pro version is $20-$30 per user. Most people at companies are not using this and im not sure this will add to the bottom line very much. That means most of the earnings growth will have to come from the cloud business, admittedly the cloud business has been growing at double digits for a long time but there is also a lot of competition in cloud space, at some point growth will slow as cap ex spending slows. The other thing to consider is what AI costs for these companies. The GPU's are expensive, Data storage is expensive and the energy demand from AI use is very very expensive. At some point AI use, especially from free users is going to eat into the profit margins.\n\nMSFT right now is like buying a over priced Cadillac, yeah it drives nice but its overpriced.\n\nAAPL is also overvalued at 35x earnings. Adding chatGPT to a smartphone and enhancing siri isn't worth the current valuation. The goggles were a bust. No new products on the horizon just same stuff just newer versions. Apple isn't the glamorous high growth tech company it once was. Iphones sales are falling off in China and this will definitely show in the next couple quarters of earnings. Its the Nike of tech stocks. People aren't spending $100 for shoes they certainly wont spend $900+ for a phone. I wouldn't be surprised if Buffet starts to offload shares at this PE ratio.\n\nThat fourth industrial revolution is not happening today or tomorrow, we are too early. This is going to take some time.\n\nI agree with Ken Griffin on this, the current AI products on the market are not the revolution many are hoping for, they're mediocre at best. There's too much spending and too much free products for this to add to any company's bottom line. The real winners are semi's, data storage and anything surrounding it. \n\n[https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/01/ken-griffin-says-hes-not-convinced-ai-will-replace-human-jobs-in-near-future.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/01/ken-griffin-says-hes-not-convinced-ai-will-replace-human-jobs-in-near-future.html)\n\nThere is one area that will benefit astronomically from AI but that will come a bit later.",

My performance would have been much better without taking tax hits from selling stocks.\n\nI am from Europe, tax hit is about 26% on all gains above 1000\u20ac(annually) when selling. I mean, I knew it before, but I just realized it this year, as my tax hits are 4 figures now. I do understand more and more why Warren B. says \u201cIf you aren't thinking about owning a stock for ten years, don't even think about owning it for ten minutes.\u201d The most important part is really to not interrupt compounding.\n\nTake for example AAPL. \u20ac10k invested in AAPL in January would be +17% \u20ac11.7k. You would have beaten the market when holding. If you sell: \u20ac1.7k gains 26% taxed left about \u20ac11.25k left. You would be up only up about 11% and been beaten by the index after selling. Index-funds have the big advantage, that they get taxed only at the very end, that way you don't interrupt compounding. I mean this is no rocket science and I am dumb to realize this only now, but the recent tax hits really opened my eyes.\n\nTo end this post with something useful: How is your portfolio doing? Have you beaten the S&P? What's your % YTD?\n\nTLDR: Tax on my investments is destroys my gains. Never interrupt compounding, unless it's absolutely necessary.",

    "title": "Nvidia to get 20% weighting and billions in investor demand, while Apple demoted in major tech fund",
    "selftext": "KEY POINTS\n\n* Microsoft and Nvidia will likely have a weight of around 21% in this tech ETF, while Apple will be down to about 4.5%, according to Matthew Bartolini, head of SPDR Americas Research.\n* The rebalance will be in effect for one quarter, even if Apple outperforms Nvidia significantly ahead of the official date.\n* The ETF has about $71 billion in assets under management, so a 15-percentage-point change in the fund equates to more than $10 billion.\n\n\n\n[Nvidia](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/NVDA/)\u2019s blistering rally will force a major technology exchange-traded fund to acquire more than $10 billion worth of shares of the chip giant while cutting dramatically back on\u00a0[Apple](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AAPL/).\n\nThe index that the\u00a0[Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK)](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/XLK/)\u00a0follows will soon rebalance, based on an adjusted market cap value from Friday\u2019s close. The new calculations show\u00a0[Microsoft](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/MSFT/)\u00a0as the top stock in the index, followed by Nvidia and then Apple, according to Matthew Bartolini, head of SPDR Americas Research.\n\nAll three stocks would have a weight above 20% in the index if there were not caps in place. But diversification rules for the index limit how big the cumulative weight of stocks with at least a 5% share of the fund can be.\n\nAs a result, Microsoft and Nvidia will likely have a weight of around 21%, while Apple will fall sharply to about 4.5%, Bartolini said.\n\nThat is a change from the prior weightings, which saw Nvidia\u2019s weight be kept artificially low by index rules. As of June 14, Microsoft and Apple were both at about 22% each in the fund, while Nvidia was just 6%.\n\n  \nThe race to finish in the top two came down to the final day. As of Monday, market cap data from FactSet shows that all three companies are over $3.2 trillion and within $50 million of each other, though that data does differ slightly from the calculations used in the index.\n\nThe XLK has about $71 billion in assets under management, so a 15-percentage-point change in the fund equates to more than $10 billion. SPDR does not comment on specific trading strategies around rebalances.\n\nThe big shift in the XLK is an extreme example of how even passive index funds can diverge, especially when focusing on narrow slices of the market.\n\n\u201cUnderstanding how they might be weighted, where they\u2019re allocated, what the rebalance frequency is, is really important because it can create differences in exposures and make what\u2019s beneath the label seem different from fund to fund,\u201d Bartolini said.\n\nThe fund follows the Technology Select Sector Index from S&P Dow Jones Indices, which uses a float-adjusted calculation to determine market cap. The rebalance officially takes effect at the end of this week.\n\nThe free-float adjustment for market cap accounts for large holders of an individual stock that are unlikely to be trading on a daily basis. For example, Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway owns more than 5% of Apple, which could count against it in the index, Bartolini said.\n\n\u201cIts free-float market capitalization is reduced because you have so many controlled interests in the company,\u201d Bartolini said.\n\nThe rebalance will be in effect for one quarter, even if Apple outperforms Nvidia significantly ahead of the official date.\n\nOn Monday, shares of Apple were up 1.8%, while Nvidia ticked up 0.2%.\n\n[https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/17/nvidia-to-get-20percent-weighting-and-billions-in-investor-demand-while-apple-demoted-in-major-tech-fund.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/17/nvidia-to-get-20percent-weighting-and-billions-in-investor-demand-while-apple-demoted-in-major-tech-fund.html)",

    "selftext": "If you\u2019ve been keeping an eye on Apple (AAPL), you know it\u2019s been a wild ride lately. The stock took a beating in the first four months of 2024, dropping 8% while the Nasdaq-100 Technology Sector index climbed 6%. Why? Stagnant growth and a DOJ lawsuit knocked investor confidence. But then May came along, and Apple bounced back with a 12% surge thanks to strong Q2 results for fiscal 2024, announced on May 2.\n\n**Quick Stats**\n\n* **Current Price:** $196.89 (+1.24%)\n* **Market Cap:** $3,019B\n* **52-Week Range:** $164.07 - $199.62\n* **Volume:** 53M (Avg: 60M)\n\n**What's Driving the Turnaround?**\n\nApple\u2019s revenue for Q2 2024 dipped 4% year-over-year to $90.8 billion, mainly because iPhone sales fell to $46 billion from $51.3 billion last year. But here\u2019s the kicker: Apple\u2019s earnings per share nudged up to $1.53, beating the $1.50 expectation. The services sector is where Apple shone, raking in a record $23.9 billion, up 14% year-over-year. This area is a goldmine for Apple, bolstering its bottom line even when hardware sales lag.\n\nLooking ahead, Apple expects revenue to pick up in the current quarter, driven by services and a bounce back in iPad sales. Given that iPhones contribute to half of Apple\u2019s revenue, any uptick in smartphone sales will be a big win. The global smartphone market is on a comeback, with 7.8% growth in Q1 2024, according to IDC, and AI-enabled smartphones could be a game changer this year.\n\n**AI: The Next Big Catalyst**\n\nApple\u2019s rumored to be diving into the AI smartphone market with iOS 18. Features like AI-powered transcripts, message summaries, and even a smarter Siri could debut soon. AI enhancements are expected to drive another upgrade cycle, and with Apple holding a 17% share in the smartphone market, this could be huge.\n\n**Should You Buy In?**\n\nAnalysts are bullish. Wedbush Securities sees Apple\u2019s AI-enabled iPhones kicking off a major upgrade cycle, upping their price target to $275 from $250\u2014a potential 45% gain from current levels. The median 12-month price target is $202, suggesting a 6% upside.\n\nHere\u2019s the play: Apple\u2019s trading at 29 times trailing earnings, which is a discount compared to the Nasdaq-100\u2019s 31 times. With analysts revising their earnings expectations upwards and AI developments on the horizon, this might be the moment to get in before Apple starts another run.\n\n**Action Plan:**\n\n1. **Buy Zone:** Under $195, if you\u2019re looking for a solid entry.\n2. **Sell Targets:** Short-term around $202; long-term riding the wave towards $275.\n3. **Watch List:** Keep an eye on AI updates and quarterly earnings for quick reaction opportunities.\n\n",

Like their latest offerings in pc with infused AI, and tablet.\n\nNext up AMZN, up 21% YTD, also a wide moat, with a lot of stability in their supplied items and businesses.  Nothing really lights up the sky, just plodding along.  I think they have an AI strength used in their background business, but has an appearance of hiding, as it has no consumer face to it.\n\nLastly NVDA, up 110% YTD.  They are definitely the star of the moment, and I think there is still gas in this tank, but being a hardware vendor mostly with some software driven solutions for AI for their platform alone, they may have locked up a good lead that will only grow.\n\nLooking at doing a 50/25/25 split (MSFT/AMZN/NVDA), thoughts?  Would love to hear any positive or negative on this.\n\n  \nedit, fixed percentage ups ytd.",

    "selftext": "*Consumers will soon have access to*\u00a0[*yet another streaming bundle*](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/the-streaming-wars-are-over-morning-brief-100018167.html)*. Comcast (*[*CMCSA*](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CMCSA)*) CEO Brian Roberts said early Tuesday that later this month, the company will launch a new offering that combines its Peacock platform, Netflix (*[*NFLX*](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NFLX/?fr=sycsrp_catchall)*), and Apple TV+ (*[*AAPL*](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/?fr=sycsrp_catchall)*).*\n\n*The new bundle, referred to as StreamSaver, will be available to customers of Comcast\u2019s broadband internet service, the executive revealed at a MoffettNathanson conference.*\n\n*\"Those three products will come at a vastly reduced price to anything in the market today and be available to all our customers,\" Roberts said. Exact pricing details will be announced at a later date.*\n\n*\"We've been bundling video successfully and creatively for 60 years,\" he added. \"This is the latest iteration of that, and I think this will be a pretty compelling package.\"*\n\n*The developments come as media companies face pressure from investors to scale their streaming services and achieve profitability. At the same time, the companies are dealing with more competition from tech giants like Amazon (*[*AMZN*](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMZN/?fr=sycsrp_catchall)*) and YouTube (*[*GOOGL*](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOGL)*,*\u00a0[*GOOG*](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOG)*), which are*\u00a0[*gobbling up*](https://sports.yahoo.com/amazon-wins-nfl-playoff-game-025638395.html?fr=sycsrp_catchall)\u00a0*streaming deals.*\n\n*On average, US consumers subscribe to four streaming services and spend about $61 per month on them, according to the latest Digital Media Trends report from*\u00a0[*Deloitte*](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/industry/technology/digital-media-trends-consumption-habits-survey.html#streaming-video-at-a-crossroads)*. That means fewer opportunities for streamers to retain loyal subscribers over time.*\n\n*The concept of bundling isn't new. Companies in the space have been doing it with their own services for years. Apple, for instance, offers Apple One, which combines Apple TV+ with other services like Apple Music and Apple Arcade. The bundle launched globally in late 2020.*\n\n*Disney, which has also been offering a bundle with Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN+,*[\u00a0*officially*](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/disney-begins-integrating-hulu-disney-170000387.html?fr=sycsrp_catchall)\u00a0*began its domestic rollout of*[\u00a0*a one-app experience*](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/disneys-iger-pivots-on-hulu-stance-now-says-general-entertainment-very-positive-224831488.html)\u00a0*late last year that incorporates Hulu content via Disney+ \u2014 a similar play to*[\u00a0*Paramount's Showtime combination*](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/paramount-with-showtime-to-launch-june-27-184752031.html)\u00a0*as well as the integration of*[\u00a0*HBO Max and Discovery+*](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/warner-bros-discovery-launches-max-platform-in-bid-for-streaming-dominance-093040851.html)*, which both merged their respective services last year.*\n\n*The move toward partnerships*\u00a0[*among competing media companies*](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/streaming-bundles-a-new-era-has-arrived-154026983.html)*, though, has gained traction recently.*\n\n*Just last week, Warner Bros. Discovery (*[*WBD*](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/WBD/)*) and Disney (*[*DIS*](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/DIS/?fr=sycsrp_catchall)*)*\u00a0[*announced a new streaming bundle*](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/disney-warner-bros-try-to-follow-the-consumer-with-yet-another-streaming-bundle-163529427.html)\u00a0*that will bring together Disney+, Hulu, and Max streaming services, with a launch date set for this summer in the US.*\n\n*Earlier this year, Warner Bros. announced a*\u00a0[*sports streaming partnership*](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/the-espn-fox-wbd-sports-venture-is-a-counterstrike-against-big-tech-and-rights-fees-inflation-heres-how-191534965.html)\u00a0*with Disney's ESPN and Fox (*[*FOXA*](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/FOXA?fr=sycsrp_catchall)*), set to debut later this fall.

But the outcome, which will be decided by US District Judge Amit Mehta in the weeks or months to come, also has giant implications for some of the other big names in the tech world.\n\n>That's because Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), and Meta (META) are defending themselves against a series of other federal- and state-led antitrust suits, some of which make similar claims, and because all three stand to lose or gain depending on the outcome.\n\n>The government argues Google is violating Section 2 of the Sherman Act by blocking competitors from entering three distinct markets: general online search, search advertising, and search text advertising.\n\n>A government win would put at risk the billions of dollars in mutually lucrative contracts between Google and Apple, as well as deals with other device manufacturers and telecom companies.\n\n> The government alleged in its case that Google pays billions of dollars each year to LG, Motorola (MSI), and Samsung; major US wireless carriers such as AT&T (T), T-Mobile (TMUS), and Verizon (VZ); and browser developers such as Mozilla, Opera, and UCWeb.\n\n>Government prosecutors have alleged that Google had been paying Apple an estimated $8 billion to $12 billion per year \u2014 a portion of search ad revenue \u2014 in exchange for awarding Google Search default placement on Apple devices.\n\n>The government has yet to say what precise remedy it desires should it prevail against Google.

    "title": "Apple announces largest-ever $110 billion share buyback as iPhone sales drop 10% ",
    "selftext": "Apple reported fiscal second-quarter earnings on Thursday that were slightly higher than Wall Street expectations, but showed overall revenue down 4%, and iPhone sales falling 10%. \n\nApple announced that its board had authorized $110 billion in share repurchases, the largest in the company\u2019s history, and a 22% increase over last year\u2019s $90 billion authorization.  \n\nHere\u2019s how Apple did versus LSEG consensus estimates in the March quarter: \n\nEPS: $1.53 vs. $1.50 estimated \n\nRevenue: $90.75 billion vs. $90.01 billion estimated \n\niPhone revenue: $45.96 billion vs. $46.00 billion estimated \n\nMac revenue: $7.5 billion vs. $6.86 billion estimated \n\niPad revenue: $5.6 billion vs. $5.91billion estimated \n\nOther Products revenue: $7.9 billion vs. $8.08 billion estimated \n\nServices revenue: $23.9 billion vs. $23.27 billion estimated \n\nGross margin: 46.6% vs. 46.6% estimated \n\nApple did not provide formal guidance, but Apple CEO Tim Cook told CNBC\u2019s Steve Kovach that overall sales would \u201cgrow low single digits\u201d during the June quarter.  \n\nApple posted $81.8 billion in revenue during the year-ago June quarter and LSEG analysts were looking for a forecast of $83.23 billion.  \n\nApple reported $23.64 billion in net income, a 2% decrease from $24.16 billion in the year-earlier period. Overall sales fell 4% in the March quarter. \n\nCook told CNBC\u2019s Steve Kovach that year-over-year sales suffered from a difficult comparison to the year-ago period, when the company realized $5 billion in delayed iPhone 14 sales from Covid-based supply issues. \n\n\u201cIf you remove that $5 billion from last year\u2019s results, we would have grown this quarter on a year-over-year basis,\u201d Cook said. \u201cAnd so that\u2019s how we look at it internally from how the company is performing.\u201d \n\nApple said iPhone sales fell nearly 10% to $45.96 billion, suggesting weak demand for the current generation of iPhones, which were released in September. The sales were in-line with analyst estimates, and Cook said that without last year\u2019s increased sales, iPhone revenue would have been flat.  \n\nMac sales were up 4% to $7.45 billion, but they are still below the segment\u2019s high-water mark set in 2022. Cook said sales were driven by the company\u2019s new MacBook Air models that were released with an upgraded M3 chip in March.  \n\nOther Products, which is how Apple reports sales of its Apple Watch and AirPods headphones, was down 10% on an annual basis to $7.9 billion in revenue. \n\nDuring the quarter, Apple released its first new major product category in years, the Vision Pro virtual reality headset, but the $3500 device is expected to sell in low quantities, especially compared to Apple\u2019s major product lines.  \n\n\u201cWe\u2019re only scratching the surface there so we couldn\u2019t be more excited about our opportunity there,\u201d Cook said. \n\nApple has not released a new iPad since 2022, which is a drag on sales. Revenue for the division fell 17% to $5.6 billion. Apple is expected to announce new iPads on May 7 that could revive demand for the product line.  \n\nCook also said Apple has \u201cbig plans to announce\u201d from an \u201cAI point of view\u201d during its iPad event next week as well as at the company\u2019s annual developer conference in June.  \n\nServices was a bright spot during the quarter. Sales rose 14.2% to $23.9 billion. That\u2019s how Apple reports revenue from its subscription services, warranties, licensing deals with search engines, and payments. Apple has a broad definition of subscribers, which includes users subscribing to apps through Apple\u2019s App Store, and said that it has over 1 billion paid subscriptions.  \n\nSales in Greater China, Apple\u2019s third largest region, were off 8% to $17.8 billion in revenue, which was significantly better than the $15.25 billion in sales expected by FactSet analysts, potentially quelling investor worries that Apple may have been losing market share to local competitors such as Huawei.  \n\n\u201cI feel good about China, I think more about long term than to the next week or so,\u201d Cook said. \n\nCook told CNBC that iPhone sales grew in China during the quarter. \u201cThat may come as a surprise to some people,\u201d Cook said.  \n\nIn addition to the buyback authorization, Apple said it would pay a 25 cent dividend, a one cent increase. Apple\u2019s $110 billion buyback authorization is the largest-ever announced, ahead of Apple\u2019s previous repurchases, according to data from Birinyi Associates.  \n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/02/apple-aapl-earnings-report-q2-2024.html",

    "title": "Spotify turns a profit as earnings and revenue beat estimstes",
    "selftext": "Spotify Technology (SPOT) reported fiscal first quarter earnings on Tuesday that beat expectations on both the top and bottom lines. The audio giant also swung to a profit as it continues to implement its recent \"efficiency\" strategy.\n\nOver the past year, Spotify has committed to multiple rounds of layoffs in addition to price increases and other initiatives to boost top-line growth and improve margins. The company said it will be more intentional about future investments after spending billions on its push into the crowded podcast market.\n\nThe audio giant reported operating income of 168 million euros ($179 million), compared with a loss of 156 million euros in the prior-year period. This was below company guidance of 180 million euros as social charges came in higher than expected, \"driven by share price appreciation during the quarter\", according to Spotify.\n\nIt also guided to a strong Q2 operating income of 250 million euros, well ahead of Wall Street consensus expectations. Revenue guidance for the second quarter also came in ahead of estimates \u2014 3.8 billion euros versus the 3.76 billion euros that was expected.\n\nOn top of more deliberate spending, Spotify will reportedly once again raise prices after hiking the cost of certain subscription plans last summer.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg, Spotify plans to raise prices by about $1 to $2 a month in five markets, including the UK, Australia, and Pakistan. The changes are expected to come at the end of April, with US prices to rise \"later this year.\" The report also said Spotify plans to introduce a cheaper option that does not include audiobooks.\n\nThe stock moved more than 9% higher in pre-market trading on Tuesday following the results.\n\nThe streaming service reported net income of 197 million euros ($210 million), or earnings of 0.97 euros per share. That was ahead of analyst expectations of earnings of 0.65 euros per share. It also compares with the year-earlier period loss of 225 million euros, or a loss of 1.16 euros a share.\n\nGross margins came in stronger than expected at 27.6%, beating company guidance of 26.4%. The streamer said it expects margins to tick up to 28.1% in the second quarter, primarily driven by year-over-year improvements in music and podcasting.\n\nSpotify has previously said it expects the metric to come in between 30% and 35% over the long term amid plans to further scale its podcasting and ads business.\n\nRevenue, meanwhile, totaled 3.64 billion euros ($3.88 billion) \u2014 20% higher compared with the first quarter of 2023, and above Wall Street expectations of 3.61 billion euros.\n\nUser figures\n\nTotal monthly active users (MAUs) came in below company estimates of 618 million to hit 615 million in the quarter \u2014 but still a 19% improvement compared with the total in the year-ago period. The streaming service anticipates Q2 MAUs to come in at 631 million.\n\nPremium subscribers met Wall Street expectations of 239 million \u2014 a 14% year-over-year jump. Spotify expects that subscriber count to increase to 245 million in the second quarter.\n\nFree cash flow, another key metric for investors, came in at 207 million euros in the quarter compared to 57 million euros in the year-ago period.\n\nThe average revenue per user, or ARPU, for Premium subscriptions increased 7% to 4.55 euros (or 5% year over year, excluding foreign exchange headwinds.) ARPU was driven by price increase benefits that were partially offset by discounted plans and lower prices in emerging markets, the company said.\n\nProfit pledge\n\nOverall, analysts have been bullish on Spotify after the audio giant pledged to improve its profitability beginning in 2023 on a gross margin and operating income basis.\n\nSpotify stock has surged more than 100% over the past year and is up 43% year to date.\n\nSpotify spent $1 billion pushing into the podcast market over the past four years with splashy A-list deals and $400 million-plus studio acquisitions.\n\nThat spending took a significant bite out of gross margins and weighed heavily on profitability. In response, Spotify committed to several rounds of layoffs \u2014 three in 2023 alone.\n\nSpotify CFO Paul Vogel stepped down from his position on March 31. He will be replaced by Christian Luiga, previously at Swedish aerospace and defense company Saab. Luiga will take over in the third quarter, the company said.\n\nIn addition to layoffs and price increases, Spotify also changed up its royalty structure, made audiobooks free to paying subscribers, and locked in new deals with popular podcasters like Joe Rogan and Alexandra Cooper of \"Call Her Daddy.\"\n\nThe new deals come as Spotify further revamps its podcast strategy to focus more on distribution rather than exclusivity.\n\nThe audio giant announced that Rogan's podcast, its most popular on the platform, will be available on additional services like Apple Podcasts (AAPL), Amazon Music (AMZN), and YouTube (GOOGL) for the first time in years. Spotify will handle distribution and ad sales as it works to maximize revenue. Rogan will receive a guaranteed minimum rate and cut of the advertising revenue.\n\nCooper's \"Call Her Daddy\" deal will have a similar structure with the podcast now available on all major audio platforms after more than two years as a Spotify exclusive. The company will maintain the exclusive rights to the podcast's video portion.\n\nSource: https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/spotify-turns-a-profit-as-earnings-and-revenue-beat-estimates-102727402.html",

    "title": "Using MGK, SCHD, and SCHY to create a value and quality tilted VT like portfolio",
    "selftext": "Hey everybody :)\n\nI've been doing a lot of investment self education lately (mostly with google and chatGPT) and I kind of wanted to \"come up for air\" so to speak and run an idea I have by actual people.\n\nI'll give the idea first and then try to explain some of the reasoning behind it and then detail a quick back of the napkin analysis of its performance. I'm trying to elicit discussion!\n\n**Portfolio Construction Rules**\n\nTo start, we allocate a portion of MGK to the portfolio such that the weighting of the largest holding of MGK in our portfolio would be similar to the weighting of that position in VT.\n\nRight now, the largest holding of MGK is NVDA at 14.02%. NVDA's percentage in VT is 4.11%, so that would suggest an allocation of 4.11/14.02 or \\~29.32% to MGK.\n\nThen we look at the US and international split of VT. Right now that's 36.6%, so we allocate 36.6% percent of our portfolio to SCHY.\n\nThen the rest is SCHD or in this case 100-29.32-36.6=34.08% to SCHD.\n\n**So right now we'd be 29.32% MGK, 36.6% SCHY, and 34.08% SCHD**\n\nThen annually, we rebalance using this same procedure.\n\n**Reasoning**\n\nI think the long term historical record is clear on what tends to happen in equity returns.\n\nFundamental growth (i.e. sales growth, to a lesser extent earnings growth) tends to mean revert over time, usually within 10 years or so of a high growth period for a given firm.\n\nProfitability (i.e. ROIC or similar) tends to persist for much longer but also mean reverts in the long run (20+ years timeframe).\n\nThus, what tends to happen is that a firm posts great growth results, gets bid up as investors forecast that growth into perpetuity, fails to live up to the forecasts, gets poor returns... and vice versa, poor growth tends to get forecasted into perpetuity and tends to rebound for underperforming firms...\n\nThis leads to the value premium.\n\nHowever, just looking for lagging firms isn't a great idea because very often lagging firms are lagging for a reason, and that reason is that the business is dying (the \"value trap\" issue). One way to account for this and separate the \"temporarily setback\" from the \"dying\" companies is to use quality metrics, like ROIC, to identify the businesses that are still fundamentally doing ok even though their purchase multiples may be depressed.\n\nBuying a basket of firms like this has, historically, been a good way to get good returns.\n\nHowever, I think we all know what's coming next... this premium hasn't really manifested in global markets over the last 10-15 years, and instead we've seen the rise of massive, highly profitable firms where the growth doesn't seem to mean revert, and those firms have come to dominate our global indices.\n\nWe all know the names... NVDA, MSFT, AAPL, AMZN, GOOGL... the dominant mega cap tech and tech adjacent firms that we know and love.\n\nGiven this reality I think we have to ask ourselves a couple of questions... Is this performance a \"bubble\" in the sense of being an overvaluation of these companies, or is this an indication of fundamental changes in the structure of markets that are likely to persist over time...\n\nFrankly... I don't know, but here are some thoughts.\n\nThe argument in favor of this being a structural shift in markets is fairly strong in my opinion.\n\nFor one thing, the data that suggests that above described qualities of equities relies on data collected from time periods in which the types of companies that dominated our markets were very different that these types of companies. They tend to have much less need for capital investment to expand their operations and so can scale at a level faster and at higher rates of returns than companies in other industries. They have sources of reliable reoccurring revenue without necessarily needing to make new products or make new investments (i.e. software subscription services). They have network effects that are MASSIVE and usually reasonably high switching costs that make their customers sticky, and that's not even to get into the current big thing which is, of course, AI and where that could take us in terms of long term innovation.\n\nI've always liked the thought experiment that it makes no sense for a firm to grow at higher than average rates for a long period of time, because if they did, then their own growth would make up a larger and larger portion of overall growth that the actual underlying growth rate might converge upon their own growth rate (i.e. they're so BIG they're bringing UP the average on their own).\n\nIt's seemed like a ridiculous proposition to me, but I've seen some data showing that spending on data centers (largely for AI) in the US has eclipsed ALL consumer spending at this point, and I've also seen data suggesting that the top 10% of all household contribute to approximately HALF of consumer spending\n\nIn addition to those numbers are the weights in the indexes themselves. NVDA, one company, is literally more than 4% of the entire world publicly traded stock market... And the top 10 make up \\~20%... In US markets it's even more crazy where NVDA, MSFT, AAPL, AMZN, META, AVGO, GOOGL, and TSLA make up more than a third of the S&P 500\n\nIt's ridiculously top heavy, and historically, that might make you think \"it's a bubble\" but these aren't ridiculously bid up speculative firms with no earnings. They have high PEs for sure, but they're ridiculously profitable firms with good growth headwinds for the next decade.\n\nThe market is fundamentally VERY different from the days of industrial, consumer staples, consumer discretionary, and financial firm dominance that (critically to our discussion) marked the time periods in which the research that suggests a value premium exists were based on. It's possible the markets have fundamentally changed.\n\nSo...\n\nWhat do you do about all of that?\n\nWell for one thing, \"This time, it's different\" is a dangerous phrase in finance, and all of that \"structural change\" stuff I've just said might very well be exemplifying that phrase. Maybe, for example, there is a qualitative shift in AI design needed to reach AGI (whatever that means) level of intelligence that current LLM based models just can't solve and it's NOT just a scaling problem with data center size and computing power such that the current AI craze slows down over time (the disappointment of ChatGPT 5 is an indication this might be true) That's fairly reasonable imo, if this case is true then you just keep plugging at the value and quality premium and ignore the idea of big tech leading to a structural market change that invalidates it, and that strategy actually performs reasonably well, even in an environment of big tech dominance.\n\nAs an example, SCHD (which is a dividend focused ETF but does a good job at capturing firms with good quality factors and good valuations imo) returned about 12.3% over the past decade, which is less than the S&P 500's 14.5% return over the same time period and much less than MGK's 17.97% returns over the same time period, but relative to historical norms of \\~10% per year returns in US equities it's still very good, and it did it with very little exposure to the tech giants that have dominated US equities over that time period AND without seeing the same kind of multiple expansion that has happened in US markets over that time period.\n\nIf you use the strategy I suggested for the portfolio as a whole but only the US slice, then you'd have a portfolio that's about 54% SCHD and 46% MGK, and that portfolio would have returned \\~14.9% over the last decade whereas VTI only returned 13.9%, suggesting the premium is still \"working\" in the portion of the market that is NOT \"big growth.\"\n\nSimilarly, SCHY (or the index that underlies it as SCHY itself is only a few years old), which follows similar portfolio construction rules to SCHD but for international markets, got returns of 9.92% over the last decade whereas VXUS got only 7.54%.\n\nTo me, this result suggests that maybe the idea of value and quality still \"works\" in the market, it just works in a different segment than these big tech players, and it's possible that at some point in the future, maybe soon, maybe far, that it reasserts itself largely enough to lead to a long term time period of outperformance as these big firms do actually finally face headwinds that materially hamper long term returns.\n\nAnother approach is to give up on active investing in general and just buy an index.\n\nAgain, this is very reasonable. It's probably what most people (including possibly me!) \"should\" do.\n\nHowever, I will assert that while it's VERY difficult to pick \"winners\" it's not as hard to pick losers, and if you just index, you do make sure you get the winners, but you also systemically buy... well, not so good companies... \n\nI think a third option is the portfolio construction I detailed above.\n\n**The idea behind it**\u00a0is that you're betting, in a globally proportionate way, on the value + quality premium showing up in the market in the long run while also hedging the idea that the current mega cap growth stock dominance is a true long term (like lifetime defining...) shift in the structure of markets such that they will continue their dominance and you weight them specifically in your portfolio in a similar way to how they would have been weighted in an indexing approach.\n\n**Performance Analysis**\n\nOk, here's where I go over some numbers. I've already said a few of them in my discussion, but if I look at how that portfolio that I detailed at the top has performed, here's what it looks like:\n\nMGK 17.97% 10 year return 29.32% of the portfolio\n\nSCHD 12.3% 10 year return 34.08% of the portfolio\n\nSCHY 9.92% 10 year return (using the underlying index as a proxy) 36.6% of the portfolio\n\n**Total portfolio return:**\u00a017.97\\*0.2932+12.3\\*0.3408+9.92\\*0.366 =\u00a0**13.08% CAGR**\n\n**VT Return: 11.16% CAGR**\n\nNow, this simplistic analysis has a few problems:\n\nWe'll start with taxes. One of the biggest advantages to simple indexing strategies is how tax efficient they are. Even if you can find a strategy that outperforms them, doing so AFTER accounting for the tax drags associated with trading is VERY difficult.  This strategy is fairly tax efficient but less so than simply buying VT.\n\nLet's try to calculate a tax drag on each strategy.\n\nFor VT, you're never selling... so you don't get hit with capital gains taxes, but you do get hit with dividend taxes. Let's assume you're paying the top US qualified dividend tax rate on your dividends, which is 20% and the yield on VT is \\~1.72% so you get a tax drag of \\~0.344% and... that's it...\n\n**Total VT return after taxes: 10.81 CAGR**\n\nFor my proposed portfolio it's a little more complicated... First off, there are way more dividends. Though I used them as proxies for a value + quality tilt, SCHD and SCHY are fundamentally dividend funds.\n\nRight now SCHD pays a 3.8% yield and SCHY pays a 3.71% yield. MGT also pays a 0.4% dividends (yes, dividends on growth stocks!) Given their weights that's a total dividend yield of 0.4\\*0.2932+3.8\\*0.3408+3.71\\*0.366 = \\~2.78%\n\nAssuming the same tax rate and you get a tax drag for the dividend portion of \\~0.56%\n\nThen for the rebalancing part. It's going to accumulate a tax drag, but it's hard to estimate how much. When I think through the logic of the rebalance, if the premise is true that the top growth will keep dominating BUT the REST of the market still sees a value premium (and in the last decade, it seems to have been a bit larger in the international markets) then we're likely consistently moving money toward MGT and out of SCHD and SCHY and we know that the price return portion of our total return was roughly 10.3% per year, if we assume the top long term capital gains tax rate on ALL of that it would be a 2% drag per year (20% rate) but since most of our portfolio is NOT being rebalanced, it would likely be far smaller.\n\nThis is much harder to guestimate without doing a more detailed backtest, I posed the question to ChatGPT and it suggested a \\~0.3% drag, which would indicate moving around \\~15% of the portfolio each year. That seems reasonable, but I'll go ahead and assume a higher one of 0.5% per year to be safe.\n\nThat leaves us with a\u00a0**total portfolio return after taxes of 12.02% CAGR**\n\nThat's some significant outperformance!\n\nObviously there are a few issues here. Firstly past performance does not predict future performance. Secondly, this \"back of the napkin\" method ignores a lot of things. For one thing, I started with the current split of MGK to SCHD to SCHY which is likely NOT what it would have been if I'd followed the same rules 10 years ago. Would the shifts over the last decade have made the returns higher or lower? Idk. Thirdly, I used current dividend yields to estimate tax drag instead of actual historical ones. Is the yield of this portfolio similar throughout time? Also, idk, a rising allocation toward the megacaps that tend to pay less in dividends might suggest that past years would have had more dividends. Also, SCHY has been on a tear this year (impact of tariff concerns in the US I think) so it's dividend is MUCH lower than it has been for most of the last decade. Similarly SCHD's is higher (and for similar reasons, again showing this structural divide, the tariff concerns are impacting NON mega cap growth US firms, but the mega cap growth is enough to still bring up the index...)\n\nOf course, another piece is that I haven't analyzed volatility or drawdowns. As someone who is mostly long term and fundamentals driven, I tend to care about this less than average, but it would be important to analyze before drawing conclusions. I suspect it would perform reasonably well. MGK is high volatility but again we're just holding in proportion to its weighting in the index and SCHD and SCHY both tend to have low volatility holdings.\n\nThere would need to be more extensive back testing done to figure out if there is any value to this strategy...\n\nBut... I think the reasoning behind it is sound (capture value + quality premium in a globally diversified way while hedging mega cap growth dominance) and initial \"back of the napkin\" math looks promising\n\n**I know that was a long post... thanks for reading :)**\n\n**Thoughts?**",

Does this make any sense at all? It seems to me that eventually I will need to pay capital gains tax one way or another and my goal is to keep as much of that to 15% tax as possible.

    "title": "Why no Leveraged ETF under 1x?",
    "selftext": "\nThere\u2019s been an explosion of leveraged funds of all different types recently, and it\u2019s getting a little ridiculous: There are 1.5x, 2x, 3x, for indexes, sectors, industries, countries, and even individual stocks. Want 2x leverage for Japanese stocks? No problem- EZJ. Want 2x leverage for AAPL? AAPU is for you. And there\u2019s dozens of 2x short ETFs too. But, as far as I can tell, there\u2019s no leveraged funds between 0 and 1x, and I don\u2019t see why. \n\nThe benefit of leveraged funds is obviously higher yields, and the drawback is volatility decay. If the S&P 500 goes up 20$ and then back down 20$, you end up losing money with leverage. With a lower leverage, like .75, the opposite would happen. Instead of volatility decay, you\u2019d have volatility *growth.* Something like this would actually offer upside when the stock market is flat and protect against downside while offering only slightly limiting upside in a bull market. Look at the example below:\n\nLet\u2019s pretend the ABC index is at 100$. It drops 4%, or 4$, then returns to where it was at $100. In this scenario, if I owned 1 share of ABC, I would end up with a 0% gain. I\u2019d start with $100 and have exactly $100 at the end.\n\nNow let\u2019s say I own shares of a .75x leveraged ETF that tracks the ABC index. Let\u2019s call this ETF ABCL. If I own $100 of ABCL, then when ABC drops by 4%, ABCL would drop 3%. I\u2019d have 97$. But when ABC goes back up 4$, it actually grows by 4.17%. Therefore, ABCL would grow by 3.13%, which gives a total of $100.04, which is .04% above the underlying. Yeah, that\u2019s not much, but in a flat market that\u2019s at least something. If the market stays relatively flat over a 6-month period, those fractions of a percent would add up. Plus, there\u2019s the downside protection. If an index drops 40% and returns to its previous high, .75x leverage puts you back at 105% at a minimum. There\u2019s serious money to be made for anyone who can predict a big downturn.\n\nI\u2019ve done a bit amount of digging, and there doesn\u2019t seem to be anything like this. Why not?",

    "selftext": "Just was noticing AAPL is having a good run and thought I'd look and see what price it was when BRK sold. For reference, AAPL is trading at $240 this morning, Buffett sold at $190-$200. So basically, BRK gave up a 25% gain so they could buy more 5% treasuries? Yikes.\n\nBuffett looked like a genius in April when the tariff's first hit but for the past 6 months the S&P 500 has beat BRK 10-to-1. He's still slightly ahead of the S&P 500 YTD but over the past 12 months the S&P 500 is up 18% compared to 9% for BRK. What's interesting is BRK actually had a good run against the S&P 500 for several years, which was largely timed along his ownership of AAPL.\n\nI understand a conglomerate like BRK sitting on cash is not necessarily the same as \"timing the market\" like us regular joes. But Warren said for years there were no good deals, while the market has continued to say otherwise.\n\nEDIT - I'm getting a lot of grief over this. But if you look at what WB has said in the recent past, what he did with AAPL goes against the grain of what has made BRK successful. In 2021 after selling his airline positions at a loss Buffet said \"When we sell something, very often it\u2019s going to be our entire stake: We don\u2019t trim positions. That\u2019s just not the way we approach it any more than if we buy 100% of a business. We\u2019re going to sell it down to 90% or 80%. If we like a business, we\u2019re going to buy as much of it as we can and keep it as long as we can,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd when we change our mind we don\u2019t take half measures.\u201d Again that quote wasn't from the 80's, that was 4 years ago.",

It's basically an LLM with a bunch of tools to design a portfolio for you according to your investment goal. I've been test-driving it for about 6 weeks, and here are my results so far.\n\nThe goal was to build a moderate risk portfolio with some crypto exposure.\n\nInitially it gave me this:\n\nAAPL 5%  \nMSFT 5%  \nBND 10%  \nICLN 5%  \nQQQ 10%  \nSCHD 10%  \nVNQ 5%  \nVTI 25%  \nVXUS 15%  \nETH-USD, BTC-USD 5% each\n\nit went about 4% up so far. I got a little lucky with massive jump in ETH, at which point it suggested to rotate some of the profits into SGOV/BND, and reduce crypto exposure in general, so I'm down to about 6% crypto total.\n\nICLN was a little surprising as a recommendation, considering the political climate, but it paid off so far, up about 7%. \n\nProbably lucky timing as well, since the market was up in general. Actually the only losing investment was BTC-USD, down about 5%.\n\nThe whole portfolio looks pretty conventional, which is probably not too surprising considering that LLM would likely give you middle-of-the-road advice.",

    "selftext": "I\u2019m looking for a gut-check on a simple plan. I have an IRA (\\~$80k) and a taxable brokerage (\\~$267k) with Morgan Stanley. Both are managed accounts. Right now about 60% of the portfolio equity is effectively tied to big tech/AI (mag7). I\u2019d like to cut that concentration, move to a fund-only setup, and keep costs low. Also somewhat of a hedge towards AI bubble burst.\n\nTarget mix (household level)\n\n* 75% U.S. large cap\n   * 50% core (S&P 500 or total market: VOO/VTI or equivalents)\n   * 25% \u201ctop-7 light\u201d allocation to reduce reliance on AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, AMZN, NVDA, META, TSLA (leaning XMAG; open to RSP if that\u2019s cleaner)\n* 25% diversifiers\n   * 10% value (VTV or IWD)\n   * 5% mid cap (VO or IJH)\n   * 4% small cap (VB or IJR)\n   * 6% international (VXUS or IXUS)\n\nHow I\u2019d implement\n\n* IRA: start with XMAG only (no S&P/total market in IRA) to cut the mega-cap tilt fast with no tax hit. \n* Taxable: keep the S&P/total-market core (VOO/VTI) and systematically exit all single-stock positions, prioritizing the big tech names first. Do it tax-sensitively with about $10\u201315k per year in realized gains, have dividends go to cash to fund the new ETFs, and aim to finish in roughly three years.\n\nMy rationale for this vs just holding S&P 500?\n\n* Keeps broad U.S. exposure but dials down single-name risk.\n* XMAG (or equal-weight) helps with the current top-heavy market.\n* The diversifier slice is pretty boilerplate imo. \n\nQuestions:\n\n1. Does this combo (core + XMAG + value/mid/small/international) seem like a sensible way to cut big-tech exposure? Not a full divestment (though I'd like to - it's too risky of a bet), but a reduction in overexposure.\n2. For placement, would you park value/mid/small in the IRA and leave international in taxable for the foreign tax credit, or is that not worth optimizing?\n3. Is \\~$10\u201315k per year in realized gains and a \\~3-year glidepath a reasonable way to unwind single stocks in taxable?\n4. End stage I'd like to remove the \"managed\" signifier from these two accounts entirely. Has anyone had luck asking for a reduced brokerage fee or flat/retainer model for the advisors? How would you recommend I broach this full strategy with them?\n5. Should I deploy something similar with my 403b (if the available funds allow)?\n6. Anything else I'm missing?",

That is usually a sign that an [Accumulation](https://www.tradingview.com/x/tUSS3XGd/) is taking place. Since we are taking in consideration Wyckoff cycles for this analysis, someone could argue that, currently, we are in a [Re-accumulation 2](https://www.tradingview.com/x/ocRH2uyi/) instead of in a new forming cycle. That could be true because both are valid, it depends on how we decide to see charts. Anyway, price is showing bullishness\n\n[$AAPL 1W Chart](https://www.tradingview.com/x/6w2dPABd/) \\- In the Weekly chart, the price has just come out of an accumulation and currently it's possible we are about to form the first Re-accumulation. I'm expecting price to form at least another indecision candle (whether it will be an inside candle or a lower candle that hits the 5 or 10 EMA) to confirm a solid re-accumulation. If price manages to break that high (black line) it is very likely that price will reach another ATH in 3-6 months\n\nThis is not financial advice, obviously.  \nJust want to share with you what I see on the charts\n\n\\- Alessio",

    "selftext": "A lot is being said about the high valuations and long outperformance of the tech stocks and how risky and overvalued they are as a bunch. But there's an enormous difference just among the top 10 tech stocks by size.\n\nTSLA is trading at a PE of 177 which doesn't make the remotest bit of sense based on the business that they are in (cars) and could be in (robotaxis, robots, and AI), even if they were wildly successful in new business areas (in which they face stiff competition) there is no way to justify the current valuation.\n\nPLTR's PE is over 600 not much more I need to say about that.\n\nGOOG is trading at a PE of 21. Its core search business is going to be disrupted by AI but it is still entrenched and they have the time and resources to adapt. Meanwhile they own the largest streaming platform in YouTube, and arguably the most actually successful robotaxi business in Waymo. If they were ever split up the parts would be worth far more than the sum.\n\nAAPL's heyday is behind it since their growth is anchored in devices and they will probably never acquire significantly more market share in phones meanwhile they have to create a new Fortune 500 sized business every year just to try to keep the growth going.\n\nAMZN on the other hand is not bound by any particular industry or market. They are getting into satellites, pharmaceutical delivery, health care, and can pick any large market they want to address.\n\nMSFT's new leadership after the atrocious Ballmer has brought the company into huge new markets and they are well positioned to capitalize on AI, with a PE of 39 they are not cheap but by far not the most expensive with solid growth prospects.\n\nI personally think that social media is a scourge upon the earth and is destroying the minds of young and old people alike, but META has essentially monopolies that will not be disrupted. \n\nMeanwhile these companies are investing nearly $300 billion in cap ex per year and have returned nearly $1 trillion to shareholders in buybacks and dividends over the past 5 years. These aren't unprofitable \"dot com bubble\" stocks but entrenched cash cows.",

However, I'm exploring the idea of allocating the remaining $64k (after paying for the first year) into one or two solid companies that could see solid upside in the next 2/3 years. If everything goes well, I would then liquidate a portion of the position for each payment period (after 1 year). The school provides 4 payment periods throughout each semester thankfully.\n\nI\u2019m mainly considering large-cap names that I believe are either fairly valued or potentially undervalued. AAPL, GOOGL, and LLY are on my radar. MSFT is also in the mix as a durable compounder. I\u2019m intentionally avoiding anything too speculative or volatile (like TSLA or NVDA), and I\u2019m not looking at mid-cap or high-beta plays.\n\nAre there any companies this community sees as fitting into this plan or should I likely stick with fixed income?

    "selftext": "/\\* posted in /stocks but was removed due to off-topic...\n\nIt is entertaining to read X recently. We have a lot of users calling for Fed to cut interest rates, in hope that the rate cut will push economic growth and reduce treasury yield. We have a lot of users calling for Fed to increase interest rate, so it makes USD more appealing and reduces treasury yield. Regardless, treasury yield keeps going up. The same story of basis trade and carry trade is playing again today.\n\nIt is debatable whether we want a stronger dollar or a weak dollar, but reducing treasury yield seems to be the common goal. How could we easily create more demands for U.S. treasury bonds, when both sides of the aisle embraces the deficit expansion to the core? Well, we can force people into buying treasury bonds, we can wage a war to scare people, or we can create some phantom demands. This is where the GENIUS act may come handy.\n\nThe grand scheme is to bring assets on-chain, which requires the players to escrow real-world-assets (RWAs) and issue tokens backed with it. Geez, this sounds like mortgage backed securities and ETF already. To trade those assets, we need currencies, mostly the stablecoins. The GENIUS Act requires holding of USD or treasury bonds, which the issuers will gladly support. Let us imagine that we move NYSE and NASDAQ on-chain and create a copy of all stocks, we suddenly create demand for USD, treasury, and stocks from some users that can't access the U.S. market. Even our dear general Kim can tornado his stash and buy Apple at that time.\n\nWait! This already happened! Kraken tokenized AAPL, NVDA and TSLA today. Many other crypto firms have worked on RWA for years, including stocks, game skins, etc. GAINS even created a 100x leveraged stock trading platform until they halted it due to heavy admin burden to monitor stock earning, dividends, splits, acquisitions, etc.\n\nSo we are likely to see a concerted effort to push assets on-chain in the coming months or years, which will benefit stocks like COIN, HOOD, XYZ, PYPL, and other players, and cryptos such as LINK. Electronic stablecoin payments for daily life is another direction, and I wonder how that will affect V and MA. The damage to both may take years though.\n\nToo bad I didn't scoop HOOD at low, but I bought all above anyway.",

I have some questions about trading data specifically in extended hours or overnight and live trading data generally. Based on a recent experience I had, IBKR lite is not the way to go if you are looking to trade outside of market hours **in a world where Robhinhood exists for free.\\*\\*** I did not realize that their data is not live overnight, nor is Apple stock data/Tickertech. Unfortunately I did not realize this and purchased AAPL at $188.xx, what it had ended at on Friday and said it was trading at on IBKR lite and Tickertech/Apple stocks. I happened to go over to Robinhood where I had deposited some funds to trade overnight and went to purchase another share of AAPL where I found it was trading at $178.xx. \\*cringe\\* Where does RH source their live data and where do I get more of this info if I want to move away from Robinhood in the future? Is overnight/after hours live trading data standardized (ie there's one source) or does it vary depending on the quality of the data? Ideally I'd like to get this for free. I understand that certain more complicated sources of live market data would have a cost associated. Thank you!\n\n**\\*\\*Edit: clarification**",

    "selftext": "According to the internet and people that commented in my prior post, the market capitalisation of a company stays the same after buy back of shares i.e, the share price rises sharply to match the increase in EPS.\n\nIf that is the case, then it seems like a free way to earn money. Let\u2019s say apple is buying back half of its outstanding shares with its free reserve. I have 100 shares of AAPL which I bought yesterday for 100 dollars totally(1$ per share). I sell 50 of those 100 shares and get 50$ as compensation and hold the remaining 50 shares.\n\nNow, since there are only half the outstanding shares as before the EPS doubles. Since it has doubled, the price doubles too to match the PE ratio as before(Assuming the forecast of the company future cashflows with or without the free reserve stays the same). In such case, my remaining 50 shares are now worth 100$. Upon selling I finally have 150$ in my account.\n\nDoes the existence of such loophole mean, the EPS rising as a result of buybacks dont have a say in the future price of the stock and that market capitalisation decreases after stock buyback?",

    "selftext": "About a year ago, I took over my traditional IRA which had been professionally managed for a good while. It has a wide range of individual stocks like AAPL, AMD, AMZN, AVGO, AXP, BRKB, COST, CRM ... V, WBA, WMT (28 stocks and funds) for example, with share quantities ranging from 1 to 20+ for the individual stocks. Most, have really nice returns, but the quantity of each tends to be so small I question whether it would be wise to sell most and invest in a mix of SCHD, FXAIX, SCHG, FTEC, and FBGRX. I've already cleaned up a bunch of small quantity positions, but there are still a ton of them. I reinvested the proceeds into the funds above.\n\nWould it make sense to sell most of these remaining small positions and concentrate those funds in selected ETFs and MFs as mentioned above? I've pretty much settled other Roth and IRA accounts into a mix of S&P 500, dividend ETFs, and growth funds. But this one account remains to be cleaned up and is worth around $135k-ish currently. \n\nI'm not generally a fan of bond funds, but do have about 6% in FXNAX. I've consolidated other stocks I sold into FXAIX and SCHD, about 27% and 29% respectively. And I put some in several growth funds too like FBGRX and FTEC, about 16% between them. So the remaining 20+ stocks comprise maybe 20-25% of the account. While I kinda like having BRKB, MSFT, NFLX, NVDA, META, etc., the share quantities are so low that I wonder if I would be better off selling them and reinvesting them in my core ETFs and MFs above. \n\nFor the record, our current income is from Social Security, RMDs, and my wife who will likely work for 6 to 8 more years. I've been retired for years. The majority of our funds are in different Roth and 403b Roth and 403b IRA accounts. The account in question above is a rollover from a job years ago.",

Right now I'm on a Joint Tennant with a parent, that I need to get out of. My options seem to be, remove them with their permission from the account. Open an individual and transfer the money or a Roth IRA. My income, 29m is between 100-150k a year and I have a about 10k invested atm.\n\nIf I transfer the money to a Roth do I instantly hit the maximum? Is it worth it with my income, plus potential raises over the next 10+ years? \n\nI am also looking to consolidate my holdings for easier monthly purchases. My thoughts are to sell QQQM and NVDA to consolidate into VOO. However VOO is a bit hard to buy monthly due to price and how much I plan to put in, right now I'm averaging $200-500 deposits a month.\n\nMy holdings are AAPL, COST, DIS, GME, INTC, NVDA, RIVN, TSM, WM, AVUV, QQQM, SCHD, and VOO. I am leaning into ETFs and want to focus growth and divetends. If I up my monthly investments as I make more and become more financially stable I hope to get essiantls paid for by diventends sooner rather than later. I've also been looking into MSTY and JEPI...\n\nAny comments, shared knowledge or experience would be much appreciated!\nThanks for the read and I hope this doesn't break rule 2.",

The goal was to understand how regularity and patience could yield results.

DCA (Dollar-Cost Averaging) for the win!\n* **Stock selection matters:**\u00a0The \"Magnificent 7\" are heavily exposed to the tech sector, which had a strong year, but that also means higher volatility.\n* **Patience is key:**\u00a0I didn\u2019t touch the investments throughout the year, and that was crucial for these results.\n\nThis was a personal experiment that helped me learn more about the impact of regular investing and how the market can reward those who stick to a disciplined strategy.\n\nIt\u2019s just my experience\u2014not right, not wrong\u2014just mine, and I wanted to share it with you!\n\n**Discussion**:  \nHas anyone else here tried investment \"experiments\" like this?

This approach is considered risky, but I have strong conviction in their relative valuation, defensibility, and long-term prospects.\n\nIn this case I believe that 'diversification' among AI stocks would do more to dilute my returns than mitigate my risks. Particularly because they're all highly correlated and despite its market cap, Nvidia has the most reasonable valuation all things considered. We'll see if the bet pays off.\n\nTo clarify, I am confident in the long-term prospects of Palantir, Tesla, and others, but I'm just not comfortable with the valuations. I may reassess in the future when I have new information or valuations change.\n\nMeta is the only other stock I held onto, given my bullish view on their AI and hardware strategy combined with their attractive valuation.\n\n# Unrealized (current investments)\n\n* **Meta (META):**\u00a0\\+367.97%\n* **Nvidia (NVDA):**\u00a0\\+117.05%\n\nNvidia's performance here is understated since I recently increased my holdings, but it's up \\~200% since I initially purchased it last year after\u00a0dithering for months.\n\nThese returns are less impactful without the values or relative weights, but I\u2019d like to maintain some anonymity around it.\n\n# Rate of return (IRR)\n\nMy annual return (IRR) for this portfolio (Jun 2022 to Dec 2024) is\u00a0**73.6%**.\n\n# Investment thesis\n\nSee a summary of my investment thesis in a\u00a0[previous update](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/17mzc07/15_year_followup_on_buying_the_dip_on_pandemic/).\u00a0**TL;DR:**\n\n>\u201c\u2026AI is another secular trend like PCs (Windows, Mac), the internet (browsers, search, social) and mobile (iOS, Android, wearables). The difference is that new technology like AI can now spread faster than ever before and get used in new ways. Every new epoch uniquely benefits from the past, potentially bending the growth curve in new ways.\n\n>The other difference is that Nvidia has a monopoly position on the core technology driving this innovation. Therefore, the \\~350% run up over the last 12 months doesn\u2019t make NVIDIA the stock of the last year, but rather it\u2019s the stock of the next decade. The recent 3X gain will be a blip compared to what\u2019s coming thanks to NVIDIA\u2019s CUDA (moat), among\u00a0[other things](https://stratechery.com/2023/nvidia-on-the-mountaintop/).\u201d\n\n>\\- [1.5 year follow-up on buying the dip on pandemic stocks](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/17mzc07/15_year_followup_on_buying_the_dip_on_pandemic/), Nov. 2023\n\n# Nvidia's dominance\n\nI'm still working through my thoughts here, but my strong conviction around Nvidia comes in part from these observations:\n\n* Nvidia is\u00a0[founder-led](https://www.amazon.com/Nvidia-Way-Jensen-Huang-Making/dp/1324086718/)\u00a0and focuses on accelerated computing while remaining broad enough to allow for innovation and insight across industries where it can apply its core competencies.\n* It's unprecedented to have such dominance in such a fast-growing, valuable industry while maintaining such a long-term sustainable advantage.\n* This advantage is due to unreasonable investments (research, hardware, software, ecosystem, relationships) over decades, making it hard to copy.\n* AI will consistently make software\u00a0easier to create, thus reducing the moats of software companies and make them less attractive than hardware companies (for now).\n* Despite their impressive growth, Nvidia is still supply constrained, which is fundamentally easier to predict than demand constraints.\n\n# We still underestimate the AI opportunity\n\nMost importantly, we\u2019ve barely scratched the surface of AI\u2019s opportunities and benefits. Even the most ambitious targets underestimate it because the better and cheaper AI gets, the more use cases we'll find.\n\nWe have a habit of confusing the limits of our imagination with the limits of reality. Our imaginations are trained on what happened before, but there has never been anything like this before.\n\n# Final thoughts\n\nI'm still well within the '*maybe I'm just lucky*' phase since it's only been a couple years. Towards the end of [my last update](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1d758m7/2_year_followup_on_buying_the_dip_on_pandemic/)\u00a0I also shared a few ways my investment approach has changed, which I\u2019m still benefiting from.\n\nI expect my next update to be the 3-year update in mid 2025.\n\n**UPDATE:** Thanks for mentioning I should have included indexes for benchmark context. Indexes like QQQ and S&P 500 also had good returns during the same period (June 2022 - Dec 2024). For an apples to apples comparison, the IRR of QQQ and S&P 500 respectively during this period were \\~24% and \\~16%.",

I'm specifically thinking about how some big public incumbent companies will be hurt by it (like Chegg) and others will greatly benefit from it. There must be a number of criteria that can be evaluated based on publicly available data and are hypothesized to correlate with positive financial outcomes in the age of AI automation. For example:\n\n\\-big white collar labor expenditures as a percentage of revenue and costs, indicating an outsized return on bottom line EBITDA from investing in AI automation\n\n\\-large audiences\n\n\\-large proprietary databases and content\n\n\\-large R&D budgets\n\n\\-defensible network effects. etc.\n\nHow can I easily and effectively invest to benefit from these kinds of hypotheses? For the sake of focus, fine to focus the conversation on publicly traded stocks and funds.\n\nI know there are AI tools to analyze SEC filings, and I could build a list of hypotheses to evaluate, but this is a lot of work and others are better suited to do it than I (and I assume already have).\n\nEDIT: I'm looking to identify companies that benefit from second order effects of AI rather than chip makers and LLM builders like META, MSFT, GOOG, AAPL, NVDA.",

    "selftext": "By overlaying earnings and market cap we can get a pretty rough story of what happened with COVID and money printing and interest rate hikes and what this means for the future.\n\nThis image below is a bunch of large companies that represent the SPY. The colored areas are their earnings (with their predicted earnings in a lighter shade) and the black line is their combined market cap (price).\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/GoOoF02](https://imgur.com/a/GoOoF02)  \nI've annotated a few arrows to explain what seems to have roughly happened.\n\n**Orange Arrow 2020 - 2022:** Interest rates drop which causes excess liquidity to flood the market. Those who already had assets saw huge portfolio increases. This new wealth combined with low interest caused a housing price boom. New money in the hands of retail caused cults to form around memes like GME. Plus no one wants to work and is wfh.\n\n**Red Arrow 2022:** A \"lost decade\" is a period of time where new investors have no access to good investments. People who just started working in 2022 or decided to start investing in 2022 had no good place to put their money and would only have broken even in 2024. (the horizontal dash). In a larger crisis like with Japan's lost decade(s) you have 10-20 years where the stock market effectively grinds sideways. \n\n**Red & Orange**\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/FD8zYAb](https://imgur.com/a/FD8zYAb)\n\nIf you overlay the SPY with the Fed's interest rate policy you can see that it looks to have caused some temporary price distress but long term the price is correlated with earnings, not interest rate.  A \"lost decade\" is effectively exuberance that \"pulls forward\" price appreciation and \"steals\" it from future investors. \n\nIn the COVID response, those who had assets in 2020 benefited while those who started investing in 2022 had a difficult time b/c they didn't have access to the exponential growth of markets.\n\n**Blue Line**\n\nLong term investors who think in decades and don't actually need large purchases like cars or weddings (like old people...) can just ignore these bumps and focus on long term earnings.\n\n\\---\n\nThe above is obviously over-simplified but it's an example of how using earnings and price in tandem allows you to see the underlying story behind price movement.\n\nIf you just focus on price, all you can do is draw a line up and the right and say things that are true like \"AAPL is a good company\"\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/5L07X9p](https://imgur.com/a/5L07X9p)\n\nYou have no perspective.\n\nThe worst example is someone who got scared of investing in stocks in 2020 but seeing everyone around him get rich for 2 years he decides to start investing in 2022 and loses money for two years and decides to stop and then starts watching everyone around him make more money... in a never-ending spiral of 2 year delayed FOMO.\n\nIt's like relying on a tourist pamphlet in a foreign city. If you can't make a judgement of quality independently then you will always pay high prices and wait in long lines.",

    "title": "Investment Advice- Rebalancing?",
    "selftext": "I am looking for some advice on my current portfolio and savings plan.\n\nI'm a fairly recent immigrant to this country (36m) so started my retirement/ savings from scratch in my early 30's. Currently live in a very HCOL city on the west coast, making around 100-150k/ year running my own business as an S corp, where I pay myself a W2 salary thats roughly 60% of my income, which i adjust regularly to stay ahead of taxes. The nature of my work is project based and freelance so every month is different. This year I am paying myself approx 6k gross per month on w2. The remainder of the income from the business and other 1099 income I usually manage to write off completely as I invest it back into the business.\n\nMy main expense is rent and utilities, other than that I have no other debt (paid off car, no student debt) aside from small credit card bills (under 3k that I pay off monthly- no interest)\n\n  \n**Current Accounts and Savings:**\n\n  \nPersonal Checking Account- $3k, keep this empty for monthly expenses only. Zero interest. I view this as a pass through account- salary in, bills out.\n\nBusiness Checking Account- $20k, this account fluctuates a lot depending on cash flow, I usually try to keep it around $20k- thinking I could/ should move at least 50% into an account that accrues some interest. \n\nSEP IRA (Deductible)- 25k, I max out the contribution yearly, 25% of my w2 income (started this in 2022) I divide that total amount by 12 and make 12 monthly DCA buys into VTI. That's it. Could possibly just start dropping a lump sum?\n\nROTH IRA- 18k, Maxing this out every year. $500 monthly DCA buys into VTI (50%) VOO (40%) and 10% cash.\n\nM1 Investment Account- $3k, started this is March of this year to start putting some money into some individual stocks and slightly more speculative plays. $100 weekly DCA buys into a basket of stocks MSTR, TSLA, NVDA, AMZN, AAPL, V, LLY  etc. I like to own individual names and regular DCA just keeps the guesswork out.\n\nRegular Brokerage Account- $1.5k, use this for the occasional weekly/ monthly option contract. Any gains over 1.5k just get emptied into the ROTH. I regularly generate 400-500 per month from this account, so most months i don't even need to fund my ROTH from my personal account.\n\nChase Investment Account- $14k, $400 monthly contribtions, this was a Chase Auto Invest account (mid risk) that yielded about 10%, so below avg market returns. Chase has ended this auto investment service so the money is 80% invested into various funds but the new contributions will just be cash unless i Manually buy new funds. As this has been underperforming the market, i'm thinking about splitting this up over a few of my other accounts to streamline.\n\n  \nCrypto- $20k, been buying $100 of BTC weekly for years. Occasionally add bigger lumps on big dips. Will continue this DCA strategy.\n\n  \nSo my currently contributions to all my accounts are :\n\n  \nSEP IRA- 1k monthly DCA into VTI  \nROTH IRA- $500 monthly DCA into VTI/ VOO  \nM1- $400 monthly DCA into various QQQ type stocks  \nChase Invest- $400 monthly DCA into money market  \nCrypto- $400 DCA into BTC  \n\n\nI don't really ever sell stocks or funds, unless they become seriously overweight, or I need the cash, which hasn't happened so far.\n\nI'm fairly happy with the amount that I am able to save and invest monthly, just wondering if anyone had advice on how I could streamline this approach, or if there are other account types or assets I should consider. The monthly DCA strategy just works for me because it means I really don't worry too much about market movements, I actually prefer to see prices go down so i can buy more cheaper. \n\nTLDR: Please critique my current investment strategy, are there any other account types i should be contributing to regularly to build wealth for the future and how could i manage my regular buys/ DCA/ contributions more effectively?",

    "title": "\"frontier tech\" portfolio ",
    "selftext": "hey all, sharing what i'm calling my \"frontier tech\" portfolio, broken down by percentages. i'm looking for valuable input, feedback, and discussion around it. and, if it happens to be helpful to anyone, even better. i do want to clarify a few things:\n\n* i'm focused on AI, bitcoin, and space. investment vehicles or not, i simply think each are tech frontiers that hold tons of promise, are poised for massive growth, and will bring immense amounts of value to the world over the next few decades. let's just call this a \"frontier tech\" portfolio, to give it a name i can reference.\n* i'm not looking for feedback that just disagrees with that thesis. whether you think AI is all hype, or you are anti-Bitcoin and think it's a ponzi scheme, or you think space is a waste of resources, or anything along these lines - that's ok, i respect that perspective, but i'd like to avoid arguing about it. we just disagree about some fundamental things, and you won't convince me i'm simply wrong.\n* i AM looking for feedback on blind spots, poor/missing assumptions, overconfidence, things i'm not considering, or any other constructive input that falls within the framework of the overall thesis. i'm not just looking for people to agree with me (though that is interesting input as well) - i just want feedback that can be applied within my overall investing philosophy.\n* yes, i'm missing some key areas of what many would call \"frontier tech\" - biotech, green / nuclear energy, cybersecurity, to name a few - but i just don't have the same level of confidence in specific areas of those. i prefer to stay relatively focused on the categories where i'm most confident and able to stay up to date.\n* i'm trying to keep my language somewhat appealing to a wide audience. not looking to get too bogged down in technical details or language that would alienate someone reading this stuff who's less familiar with one or any of the spaces/categories.\n* my primary goal is a portfolio of funds and stocks that i can invest in with *strong long-term confidence in growth.* not stuff i trade frequently. and not stuff i love the idea of or that seems interesting / sexy but that i don't know enough about (SMCI, PLTR, altcoins as some good examples). i also generally prefer companies whose leadership i trust and/or admire.\n\nok, with that out of the way, let's dive in:\n\n**30% AI** - 10% NVDA, 5% SOXQ, 15% balanced mixed of NOW, MSFT, AAPL, GOOGL, META, AMZN\n\n* HIGH LEVEL: to me, this category is ABSOLUTELY going to change our world in fundamental ways over the next several decades. AI's potential is not chatGPT, or smarter versions of it. it's far beyond what we're seeing from LLMs today. if you listen to the engineers and operational leaders within the AI space, listen to not what they \"believe\" is gonna happen, but to what they know is coming because they've already used the tech, usually 1-2 years before the public even sees it, these people are overwhelmed, amazed, terrified, enchanted, bewildered. to me, that's just very interesting. i believe what some others do - that we're in the midst or on the verge of another technological revolution. i'm not bothered much that AI isn't monetizing in demonstrable, repeatable ways. i think there's been and continues to be enough fundamental, increasing advancement in this field that the value creation will absolutely surpass what most people think. as for the individual stocks, i'll do a quick dive here. to be clear, I don't think these are groundbreaking choices and many are very obvious. but, seems useful to give my favorite things about each:\n* 10% NVDA - these guys are and will continue to be at the center of the whole thing. their moat is extensive. it's not just GPU / blackwell demand. it's their CUDA programming language and universe, and stickiness of it. it's the long-term horizon required for their data centers that makes 5-10 year customers out of everyone who buys their stuff. it's CEO jensen pushing them and already looking for the \"next big thing.\" just a lot of confidence here.\n* 5% SOXQ - i like this semiconductor ETF a little more than SMH because it's more diverse (SMH is like 25% NVDA, which is great if i didn't already allocate so much there), and it's got a low expense ratio (0.19%). i love this exposure because the AI industry is driven by these companies (e.g. TSMC, Micron, Broadcam, Qualcomm, AMD, AMAT).\n* 15% mix of these...\n   * NOW - excellent leadership and integrated heavily with NVDA tech; will benefit hugely from AI boom with AI-driven automation\n   * META - founder-run and with a clear vision; demonstrating enormous resources and focus on building AI models, meeting consumer needs, being pioneers in tech at large\n   * AAPL - will probably benefit the most from consumer-facing AI products and implementation; strong leadership\n   * AMZN - AWS is a profit monster that will be huge for AI tools and services and data centers; logistics and ecom will be big AI beneficiaries; strong leadership\n   * MSFT - deeply embedded in the AI revolution with its investment in OpenAI + AI integration into Azure and Microsoft 365; excellent leadership\n   * GOOGL - AI pioneer with DeepMind / Brain; they still own search; have enormous amount of data; questionable leadership but I'm holding for now\n* No TSLA??? no. i just don't trust elon musk enough at this point. and i need confidence in a company's leadership for me to invest in its stock. there's a big chance i'm missing out (their robotics division might be incredible), but I'm able to sleep OK with that.\n* i'm also missing plenty of other AI picks. i know that. these are the ones i can invest in with the most confidence.\n\n**30% Bitcoin** - 25% Bitcoin itself (cold storage or an ETF), 5% MSTR\n\n* HIGH LEVEL: why Bitcoin? books have been written about it, but to shortly summarize my perspective - it's quite volatile and risky short-term, and quite growth-oriented and (thus far) safe long-term. excellent store of value. wonderful technology, math/code based, and may or may not upend some portion of the financial system. limited supply that's only decreasing over time. immutable. now adopted by many big institutions. goes on giant bull runs every 4 or so years. some days, it's hard to justify NOT putting more into this one, but for now i'm convinced that\u00a0 diversification is the better long-term play.\n* 20% Bitcoin - many would argue that holding actual Bitcoin, ideally off exchanges and on cold storage is the smartest play here. but there are also arguments for FBTC or IBIT (helpful in tax-advantaged accounts; trusting an ETF seems safer to some - very debatable). i do some cold storage, and some FBTC (they self-custody their Bitcoin, which not everyone does). either way, just Bitcoin. it's the only crypto play where my confidence level is very high.\n* 5% MSTR - this is a leveraged Bitcoin play. strong chance it outpaces BTC growth rate during bull runs. i may shift some MSTR profits to Bitcoin over time if it starts to really offset my 4:1 BTC:MSTR ratio.\n\n**30% Space** - 10% ASTS, 10% RKLB, 5% LUNR\n\n* HIGH LEVEL: the tech for space finally seems to match the potential that's been talked about for decades and decades. for a while, space-x really proved this out, almost single-handedly. but we clearly have some strong other players either in or entering the category. my favorites are these three. here's why:\n* 10% ASTS - you should read the kook report (google it) for a true deep dive, but to hit my high level points: they are pre-revenue but with the potential for MASSIVE growth. effectively, their satellite system aims to offer a global cellular network. think starlink but more b2b and generally better tech. they own tons of patents. they are 5+ years ahead of what many think will be a winner-takes-most race. their partners already include AT&T, Verizon, Vodafone, Rakuten, American Tower, Bell Canada, and more. they have excellent leadership. i find this a risky-ish play as they have tons to still accomplish, but the potential growth is enormous.\n* 10% RKLB - effectively, a space-x competitor on smaller rockets, with a fraction of the market cap and a huge runway for growth. i think still heavily undervalued today. nerdy/awesome leadership. vertically integrated. as telecom, defense, and general research spending expands to space economy, RKLB is positioned very, very well.\n* 5% LUNR - i've spent less time researching them than the other two, but my confidence level in the risk/reward is still pretty high. key player in the lunar economy - one of few companies that can deliver payloads to the moon. very niche but valuable moat. huge potential, good amount of risks ahead.\n\n**10% cash** - ...to buy them juicy dips.\n\nok, that's my \"frontier tech\" portfolio summary. to repeat - this is what i can confidently invest in for what i believe will be better-than-average returns over the next 10+ years. i recognize that this discussion didn't even really touch share price, EPS, P/E, profitability, revenue, or other key details. this just isn't the place where i'm getting into that. i can say that i'm comfortable with the financial metrics and details regarding these companies. but this discussion is mainly focused on what categories i think are poised for the most growth, and what companies/stocks/assets in those categories seem to be most positioned to lead that growth. thanks for reading.\n\n*\\*\\*\\*The information provided is for educational and informational purposes only and should not be considered financial advice.

Apart from that, I do have a few questions regarding my portfolio:\n\n1. Would it be beneficial to wait until LTCG takes effect next year and sell my individual equities in order to rebalance into my index funds or bite the bullet and just sell them off now?\n2. Should I concentrate all of my bond allocation inside of my 401(k) to leave more room in my IRA for index funds? Should I have bonds at all?\n3. Should I revert back to my original investment strategy within my 401(k) of the Vanguard 2070 TDF, or remain with my S&P 500 Index?\n4. Should I reduce my 12 month emergency fund into a 6 month emergency fund and lump-sum the difference in order to rebalance?\n5. Should I just go 100% VOO in my taxable account? 50%/50% VOO/VTI? Do I need to diversify with International within this account?\n6. Should I cut back on my savings/investments and focus more on myself/education?\n\nI will be doing some rebalancing on Jan 1st and around Tax Day, so any input is appreciated on how I should move things around.

In the last 10 years (Sep 2014 - Sep 2024), there were 358 all time highs for SPY, and you bought $100 worth of SPY at every all time high prices of SPY.

    "selftext": "I am trying to level up my game, and for a pretty long time I just looked at the balance sheet, a few ratios, P/E, forward P/E, compared these to the industry average, healthy cash flow, debt etc. Most of the time I just did this on well known stocks, MSFT, AAPL, NVDA, INTC, AMD, META etc. basically companies you hear about a lot everywhere, I just had no trust in lesser known companies to outperform the market, even if these basic metrics were promising.\n\nNow it worked out relatively well since I started investing, but I feel like I didn't really beat the market by too much with my stock picks given the extra risk I took. There was a study by\u00a0[Cornell](https://www.cornell-capital.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/2024-Q2-Memo.pdf?_bhlid=91b22f94067500de4f838bfb72c6cdab059cf3dc), where one of the graphs show the % of SP500 stocks beating the SP500, and while the data doesn't go back too much -would love to see one that goes back until 1970-1980 at least-. however for the 2014-2023 period it can be seen that about 40-50% of the companies beat the 'market'. So basically if you stock pick with a random generator you have a good chance to have a similar performance to the market. So I believe with a proper educated research it would be possible to tip the scales in our favor.\n\nSo I feel like the way I picked stocks was sort of look at the most hyped and known companies, have a basic glance on some ratios and the balance sheet, and I feel like this is so bad that it will bite back after a while. I see quite a few people here on reddit and some other communities knowing so much about a company, the moat they have, why it's a good investment, why it would be a bad one etc. What is the proper approach to get information? What sources are valuable? I assume earning reports are one, but I doubt they have all the information of the industry the company is in, why it's better than competitors etc. surely there are some other sources that are used for all this.\n\nAny advice is appreciated!",

    "selftext": "I posted a couple weeks ago seeking some advice on a 3 fund portfolio and bonds [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1elrna2/3_fund_portfolio_bond_advice/).  Got lots of great feedback, and now that I have digested it all - I'm looking to move on some of it and hoping for some followup great advice on how to best handle.  The gist of it was:\n\n  \n*$5M portfolio, heavily weighted in AAPL and TSLA (80%) with $1M cash. Commenters suggest diversifying into index funds or bond funds, considering the tax implications of selling stocks, and caution against over-reliance on Schwab Intelligent Portfolios due to its high cash allocation. Some recommend exploring municipal bonds for tax efficiency and using a more conservative investment strategy given my financial situation.*\n\nWhat I've started the process of doing is moving some of the cash to VOO, VXUS and VXF at a 50/25/25 split.  I feel confident with that mix and my goal of turning this $5M into $10M in \\~10 years seems possible.  That just leaves the stocks and figuring out how to best convert those over into the 3 funds.  Am I right in assuming that there is really no real trick to this other than to sale them at the rate of taxes I'm willing to incur each year?  Much of the AAPL and TSLA holdings are profit so they are gonna hit me the hardest.  If I'm right in that assumption - what not just pull the bandaid off and do them all now?  Is there any real benefit to doing them over several years?  I don't plan on selling everything, but do want to move the bulk of stuff to those 3 funds.",

    "selftext": "I'm 44 years old and have about $5M in my Schwab accounts. Around $1M is in SNAXX money market, taking advantage of the high interest rates, and the rest is in stocks and mutual funds. My largest holdings are in AAPL and TSLA, accounting for about $3M.\n\nI spoke with my adviser at Schwab today because I'm ready to redirect my monthly SIMPLE IRA contributions (\\~$2666/month for my wife and me) from buying stocks to something else. He suggested the Schwab Intelligent Portfolio, which seems like a good fit. I've also been reading about the 3-fund portfolio.\n\nSo, with all that in mind, I have a few questions:\n\n1. **Feedback on SIP vs. 3-fund portfolio?**\u00a0If I go with the 3-fund portfolio, should I stick with the Schwab options listed on the Bogleheads wiki, or is there a better way to choose the funds?\n2. **Advice on moving $500K from SNAXX to bonds:**\u00a0I'm ready to move half of the $1M in SNAXX to bonds in preparation for interest rates coming down, so I can lock in some good returns for the next 5 years. Any recommendations on what I should consider buying?\n\nI've done well so far by just buying stocks, but this is a bit out of my expertise, so I would love some guidance. Thanks!",

    "title": "Analyzing the Analysts: Using average analyst price target to identify possible buying opportunities amongst the top 100 companies in the S&P",
    "selftext": "Hello everyone,\n\nI'm a lazy investor and don't like to do much due diligence, but I do like to make money. Unfortunately these two things about me are often at odds as I've lost money in the past for not doing my DD. As such, I continue to be lazy but I try and find ways to work around doing due diligence and hopefully finding loop holes.\n\nOne such way that I have been thinking about recently is using analyst ratings, reviews and price targets as a surrogate for due diligence. In essence, I try to just have these analysts do the work for me. An idea I had is that much in the same way that with those who believe in technical analysis hold that everything you need to know about a stock is baked into it's price action, and so when something good happens the stock price goes up and when something bad happens the stock price goes down, thus all you need is to analyze trends in stock price and you'll be analyzing everything about the stock by proxy, I have a thesis (or theory) that perhaps you can do the same or something similar with analyst price targets of companies.\n\nNow I know that anyone who has read this far, already thinks I'm an idiot. Many experienced individual investors probably find market analysts to be stupid and therefor I'm stupid for following their lead, but I would argue to the contrary for a few reasons. As much as I have put in a lot of effort to learn about how the market operates (been investing for the last 6 years, started learning actively about it as much as I could a couple years prior to that), there is still much I don't know as I don't have a finance or economics degree. Moreover, as bad as you may think an analyst is, they are at least competent enough to keep their job as an analyst at the investment firm that allows them to make stock price target selections. Lastly, and most importantly, what I am about to discuss below uses the aggregate of several analyst price targets so I'm not relying on a single analyst but several (probably between 10 and 40 per company). I think if two-dozen analysts are strongly in favor of a company, it is unlikely that my novice investor wisdom would have researched the company and found a flaw that they all missed.\n\nSo what I did yesterday evening was go through the top 100 S&P 500 companies by market cap and find the current average price target for them on Yahoo Finance. I then divided the current stock price (at the close on 7/31) by that price target and expressed it as a percentage to see how far off the company was from the average price target analysts were aiming for. Then I also listed how many total ratings each company had, and how many of them were 'Strong Buys' and 'Buys'.\n\nThis yielded the following table:\n\n|+|A|B|C|D|E|F|G|H|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|1|Company|Current Price|Price Target|Percent to Target|Total Ratings|# Strong Buy Ratings|# Buy Ratings|% of Ratings that were Strong

This lead me to the following 11 companies:\nMicron Technologies (MU), Boston Scientific (BSX), Abbot Laboratories (ABT), Merck Scientific (MRK), Stryker (SYK), The Cigna Group (CI), Broadcom (AVGO), Comcast (CMCSA), Honeywell International (HON), Analogue Devices (ADI), and Intuit Inc. (INTU)\n\nI have about $5,000 I'd like to invest right now and I have half a mind to just put it equally weighted into these 11 companies and just watch it for the next year or two. I'll either do that or put it all in VOO, but I have a feeling that these 11 companies might beat the S&P 500 over the next 24 months.\n\nWhat do you guys think?",

    "selftext": "One of the arguments for investing in the S&P 500 is that it's cheaper (in the UK, net of tax) than global index funds, like the FTSE All-World. And you get most of the same risk-return profile, because the US stock market is the largest market.\n\nWhat if that logic was extended further?\n\nImagine a fund that only ever held one stock. The stock that had the largest market cap weighting in the (publicly listed) investment universe. It only ever traded (1) when the #1 stock changed, and (2) to reinvest dividends. Very few trades reduces holding costs to a minimum.\n\nToday, the all in fund would hold 100% AAPL.\n\n5 years ago, it held 100% MSFT.\n\nIn 1990, it held 100% XOM.\n\n[https://www.finhacker.cz/top-20-sp-500-companies-by-market-cap/](https://www.finhacker.cz/top-20-sp-500-companies-by-market-cap/)\n\nWould the fund have a better return than, say, the FTSE All-World, or the S&P 500? I expect the standard deviation to be (a lot) higher, but which would risk return ratios - Sortino, Martin, ... - favour?\n\nUPDATE\n\nMy thanks to [these commenters](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1e5k8n6/comment/ldnyi7b/). Price return for the All In Index is easy to calculate. For the period 1990 - 2024 I get 12% PR annualized. Compared to 8% PR for the S&P 500.\n\nThe current beta for AAPL is 1.24. The Sharpe ratio is thus > 20% better.\n\nMy intuition for this question came from the statistical idea of representation. If there are any fund managers reading this, my DMs are always open.",

    "title": "Active IRA management vs index funds and ETFs?",
    "selftext": "I\u2019m curious to know where people stand on whether they think they should place their own trades in IRA accounts vs buying index funds and etfs. I\u2019m on the side of active only because I know what I\u2019m doing especially during high volatility when I\u2019m able to pick up stocks at lower prices during or after selloffs. This concentrated buying has allowed me to see pretty big upside when the stock rebounds especially if it rises more than the index. The risks of this is that SPY/QQQ has been rising consistently. I have been really conservative about buying tech thinking the market will pull back and I have missed out big as a result. My YTD would be around 30-40% if I didn\u2019t sell my positions early but that\u2019s life. \n\nMe (Roth IRA): 19.35% YTD\n\nMy 401k: 15.27%\n\nS&P: 18.61% YTD\n\nNasdaq 100: 20.83% YTD\n\nMy biggest winners include\n\n-RKLB. 37.92%. $4.05. I think this is a 5-10 year play. I buy on dips. I\u2019m too afraid to sell covered calls on this for fear of the price running without me.\n\n-Arm bought near 52 week low and sold around $80 thinking it was overvalued\u2026 I bought back with a small stake at $120 begrudgingly only to see it rise to $170.\n\n-hood. Bought at $8, sold for $9.50\u2026. Thought it would keep ping ponging. Bought back at $20 and will average down if need be but the company is not going out of business\n\n-rivn. Up 35% YTD, my biggest position. I bought slightly high but kept averaging down. I actually believe in the company. Cost basis $12.94.\n\n-aapl. Up 20% YTD. I have a small stake because I kept waiting for Apple to drop to $130 before rising to $200 which did not happen. Cost basis $195.\n\n-Bcrx. Up 58% YTD. I\u2019ve known this bio company for almost a decade now. They ping pong so it\u2019s mostly cyclical. $4.65 cost basis \n\n-cava. Up 26% YTD. Kicking myself for not buying more. \n\n-SG. Bought at like $9, sold at like $13. Kicking myself. I bought after reading about their subscription service and seeing how people are paying $20 for their orders\n\n-FBTC. Up 16.98%. Cost basis $47.14. Bitcoin is here to stay like it or not. Wish I didn\u2019t penny pinch when trying to buy 100 shares of MSTR 2 years ago for $500. \n\n-HUM. +19.52%, $323.75. Healthcare is expensive and this company is not going out of business so I buy dips.\n\n-KWEB. +17.52%, $23.90. China will rebound, well at least Chinese tech. \n\n-Lmnd. +25.08%, $16.16. Saw a report on their business model and it gives headaches but can work if they survive the growing pains. I think they are here to stay and will probably get to $60 in the next 5 years.\n\n-Meta. +19.29%, $420. I actually bought Meta at $115 during the crazy but got spooked when it dropped below $110, I sold for a profit but kicked myself for not holding. I believe in the company and they are just getting started revenue wise in my opinion. So many AI plays here. Regretting not having the cash to load up this time around. \n\n-NFTY. +15.23%. $53.77. India will probably keep growing. This stock also pays a good dividend. \n\n-RBRK. +13.75. $30.83. Cybersecurity is growing. I also have positive numbers in Palo Alto which I buy on earnings drops\n\n-snap. +42.52%. $11.33. Snap is not going out of business. The stock drops after earnings so I just buy then and wait for a rebound. It\u2019s one of my largest holdings. Wish I dumped more cash and wish it would drop when the market drops but it\u2019s held firm the last few months\n\n-Z. +23.83%. $40.83. Bought during the sell off when the courts ruled against the industry. Zillow will be fine. \n\n\nI actually don\u2019t have many losers. The stakes are small.\n\n-Aal. -14.41%. $12.54. I think it will bounce back in a year or two. \n\n-CGC. -15.33%. $7.52. I don\u2019t know much about weed but figured I\u2019d buy a small stake just in case.\n\n-MSOS. -14.19%. $8.70. Small stakes in weed, lottery ticket\n\n-WBD. -15.88%. $8.66. The worst buy I\u2019ve made. Figured might as well keep it.\n\n-Snow. -13.67%. $154.53. I knew I was buying high with snowflake but didn\u2019t expect the big drop. The stake is not big. I still do believe in the company.\n\n-Dis. -9.94%. $107.54. Knew I was buying high, my fault really. Thankfully not a big position and Disney will bounce back.\n\n-Hubs. -17.29%. $570.91. Tiny stake. I actually like the current price and will buy around $420.\n\n-CMG. -7.08%. $61.36. Knew I was buying high but long term hold.\n\n-PZZA. -7.84%. $45.74. One of my larger stakes. Papa John\u2019s is at a 4-5 year low which is crazy to me since their numbers are not bad. It\u2019s a cyclical play if you look at the chart. Plus the company is not going out of business. Worst case scenario is this drops to high $20s which do don\u2019t know how that can even happen. I\u2019ll keep buying weekly. ",

Interested in your thoughts on the three below but also on what you would be thinking in that same timeframe.\n\n**High Risk - Heavy on bitcoin ETF**\n\nThis one is interesting as a lot of bitcoin optimists predict bitcoin to hit 100k - 150k by end of 2025.  I am not sure I would hang on to this strategy long term but instead wait to see if it can get over 100k and cash out and then go down to more of a Medium Risk - if I went this route.\n\n**Medium Risk - Tech Heavy with some ETFs**\n\nHeavy with some of the big tech like AAPL, NVDA, MSFT, AMD, etc.... along with some funds like SPY, QQQ and SCHD.  This one feels like it could go very well in the next 5-10 years if tech and AI continue to be the forefront of the conversation.  It's still not really that diversified but feels like it could maximize returns on the happy path.\n\n**Low Risk - Retirement centric 2030 or 2035 target funds** \n\nAlmost completely fund based where the investments could be spread amongst a few funds that are 2030 or 2035 target retirement funds and would have the requisite risk associated with retiring in the near term.",

    "selftext": "Hello all, I am very confused on how to proceed from the position I am in, and so would really really appreciate some advice. I am 19 years old.\n\nFirstly, for some background, I started trading maybe back in 2022, I put in about $2500 in a WeBull trading account and invested in a bunch of big names like AAPL, TSLA, LMT, etc. And I invested some money into some complete no name stocks that I saw on TikTok. By what I would imagine to be completely luck, these stocks actually did quite well and they have been in the green for some time now. But yes, I know not to take advice from TikTok lol.\n\nFast forward to now, I havent touched the account since then, and opening it I have made a return of about 16% with about $400 in total open P&L. Which I feel like is good? maybe? I don't know.\n\nAnyways the reason I'm making this post is because I'm interested in short term profits, I have always wanted to get into options but to be honest it just seemed very tricky and like gambling, and so it's always been a \"I'll learn how to get into it later\", but a few days ago I heard about something called futures trading and it seems much more simple and I would like to get into it. I have a very superficial understanding of how it works, and so I was just hoping to ask a couple questions about it:\n\n1. Should I trade futures through a prop firm? Especially if I am just starting out/don't have a trading strategy? Or would I be better off starting with micros & my own money?\n2. On that note, how do I go about developing a trade strategy? Do I just watch a YT video on different strategies available and pick one? My friend told me all strategies will work if I just use discretion but tbh that just made me more confused lol\n3. What should I\u00a0use\u00a0to trade futures? I have heard that Ninjatrader is good.\n\nAnd the next topic comes to my Roth IRA through Fidelity. over the course of a few months back in 2022 I put $200 in it monthly and eventually stopped, mainly because I was confused what ETFs I should put my money in.\n\nPeople have told me VOO > SPY, but then some others said $FXAIX > $VOO. Which, if any, is true? Should I invest in all 3? Also, is $200 a month enough? Should I aim to max for $6500 contributed annually? Does it really matter?\n\nI realize this post is all over the place and I apologize, but it's all the more reason I would appreciate some answers and so that I know where to go moving forward. Thank you very much!!!!",

    "title": "Nvidia to get 20% weighting and billions in investor demand, while Apple demoted in major tech fund",
    "selftext": "KEY POINTS\n\n* Microsoft and Nvidia will likely have a weight of around 21% in this tech ETF, while Apple will be down to about 4.5%, according to Matthew Bartolini, head of SPDR Americas Research.\n* The rebalance will be in effect for one quarter, even if Apple outperforms Nvidia significantly ahead of the official date.\n* The ETF has about $71 billion in assets under management, so a 15-percentage-point change in the fund equates to more than $10 billion.\n\n\n\n[Nvidia](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/NVDA/)\u2019s blistering rally will force a major technology exchange-traded fund to acquire more than $10 billion worth of shares of the chip giant while cutting dramatically back on\u00a0[Apple](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AAPL/).\n\nThe index that the\u00a0[Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK)](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/XLK/)\u00a0follows will soon rebalance, based on an adjusted market cap value from Friday\u2019s close. The new calculations show\u00a0[Microsoft](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/MSFT/)\u00a0as the top stock in the index, followed by Nvidia and then Apple, according to Matthew Bartolini, head of SPDR Americas Research.\n\nAll three stocks would have a weight above 20% in the index if there were not caps in place. But diversification rules for the index limit how big the cumulative weight of stocks with at least a 5% share of the fund can be.\n\nAs a result, Microsoft and Nvidia will likely have a weight of around 21%, while Apple will fall sharply to about 4.5%, Bartolini said.\n\nThat is a change from the prior weightings, which saw Nvidia\u2019s weight be kept artificially low by index rules. As of June 14, Microsoft and Apple were both at about 22% each in the fund, while Nvidia was just 6%.\n\n  \nThe race to finish in the top two came down to the final day. As of Monday, market cap data from FactSet shows that all three companies are over $3.2 trillion and within $50 million of each other, though that data does differ slightly from the calculations used in the index.\n\nThe XLK has about $71 billion in assets under management, so a 15-percentage-point change in the fund equates to more than $10 billion. SPDR does not comment on specific trading strategies around rebalances.\n\nThe big shift in the XLK is an extreme example of how even passive index funds can diverge, especially when focusing on narrow slices of the market.\n\n\u201cUnderstanding how they might be weighted, where they\u2019re allocated, what the rebalance frequency is, is really important because it can create differences in exposures and make what\u2019s beneath the label seem different from fund to fund,\u201d Bartolini said.\n\nThe fund follows the Technology Select Sector Index from S&P Dow Jones Indices, which uses a float-adjusted calculation to determine market cap. The rebalance officially takes effect at the end of this week.\n\nThe free-float adjustment for market cap accounts for large holders of an individual stock that are unlikely to be trading on a daily basis. For example, Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway owns more than 5% of Apple, which could count against it in the index, Bartolini said.\n\n\u201cIts free-float market capitalization is reduced because you have so many controlled interests in the company,\u201d Bartolini said.\n\nThe rebalance will be in effect for one quarter, even if Apple outperforms Nvidia significantly ahead of the official date.\n\nOn Monday, shares of Apple were up 1.8%, while Nvidia ticked up 0.2%.\n\n[https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/17/nvidia-to-get-20percent-weighting-and-billions-in-investor-demand-while-apple-demoted-in-major-tech-fund.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/17/nvidia-to-get-20percent-weighting-and-billions-in-investor-demand-while-apple-demoted-in-major-tech-fund.html)",

Microsoft has benefitted from the same investor demand for AI as Nvidia.\n\nNvidia\u2019s stock has been more volatile than Apple. Founded in 1991, it was primarily a gaming company, selling hardware to play 3D computer games. More recently it has sold cryptocurrency mining chips and cloud subscription services.\n\nNvidia shares have gone parabolic as its AI business has developed, rising over 3,290% in the past five years. It announced a\u00a0[10-1 stock split in May](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/22/nvidia-announces-10-for-1-stock-split.html).",

Older me is trying to reconcile with that.\n\nYounger me didn\u2019t know much about investing and bought individual stocks which thankfully have yielded a considerable net positive.\n\nAs I learned about ETFs/index funds/bonds/etc. over the years my investing budget went toward those and I stopped retail investing altogether. I left the individual stocks alone because they were overall very profitable and most were companies that are big names and not super volatile. However, those stocks still make up a little over 50% of overall investments.\n\nFast forward to current me where I\u2019m looking at the portfolio and seeing stuff like VTI *and* AAPL + GOOGL (just an example, but there\u2019s similar instances like that). It\u2019s redundant at best and increases exposure at worst.\n\nSelling off the individual stocks (all long positions) will yield a sizable capital gain which I\u2019m not thrilled about, though I know simplifying is ultimately the right/safest thing if I still have a ways to go until retirement.\n\nFor those who have lessons learned over time, what\u2019s the best way to approach this problem?

For all that time, I never felt the urge to venture into other investments until the recent buzz surrounding AI. Like everyone else, I was wowed by NVDA's stellar performance, just as AAPL seemed to hit a plateau and face some challenges.  \nAs a result, I offloaded half of my AAPL in November for NVDA. Come January, I found myself questioning why I hadn't just sold the whole lot, especially considering that one's growth trajectory was bound to outshine the other in the same timeframe. However, by then, NVDA had already nearly doubled. This prompted me to scrutinize the market more closely, leading to selling off the remaining half of my AAPL and diversifying my portfolio.  \nToday, here's where I stand:  \n\\- 61% NVDA  \n\\- 11% SMTC  \n\\- 9% MSFT  \n\\- 6% ORCL  \n\\- 6% MU  \n\\- 3% MRVL  \n\\- 2.5% AMD  \n\\- 2.5% PLTR  \nFirst off, I'm keen to hear your take on this mix of investments. Secondly, I'm pondering why I opted for seven different stocks instead of going all-in on NVDA, much like I did with AAPL in 2008. Let's be clear: I chose these stocks because I believe they offer reasonable profit prospects over a 3 to 5-year window for the entire portfolio. However, I'm still convinced that within a one-year timeframe, NVDA is likely to outperform the rest.  \nBottom line: Did I make the sensible move by diversifying across different stocks, or does my gut feeling that I should focus on the big player hold merit?",

    "selftext": "Title says it. If you\u2019re looking to hold for 10-40 years is NVDA really overvalued? Let\u2019s take Apple for example. On September 28, 2018, AAPL hit an all time high of $56.44. It was followed by a steep fall to high $30s in late 2018. Almost a 30% decline. I\u2019m sure it hurt investors at the time. And I\u2019m sure a lot of people were kicking themselves saying \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have bought at all time highs when it\u2019s so overvalued.\u201d However, if they held for about 5 years until today they\u2019re probably thrilled to have bought for $56.44. I\u2019d personally load the boat with AAPL these days. Sure their return isn\u2019t as high as it could have been but timing the market is all but impossible. My point is, if you\u2019re bullish on a company for strong reasons. The risk of overvaluation/draw down should not keep you sitting on the side lines. Time in the market beats timing the market. If you\u2019re not bullish on NVDA please explain why?",

    "title": "One common mistake of a novice trader",
    "selftext": "Let's imagine the mindset of beginners. Beginners want to earn quickly, a lot and with minimal effort. And most likely, we know from our experience, they will be quite fearful. So they will choose those instruments that are well-known and have a good reputation. These will probably be stocks of companies such as Google, Meta, Amazon, Apple.\n\n**How will beginners add companies to their portfolio?**  \nLet's specify that the stocks of these companies are not cheap and cost 100-300 dollars. Of course beginners want to fill their portfolio on enthusiasm right now. This means our trader will go to the stock exchange and simply buy them.  \n**What is wrong with that?**  \nThe point is that you should buy shares of even the seemingly coolest and most famous companies not at any moment of time when you want to, but look at whether it is a good time to enter a position.  \n**What does good or bad timing mean?**  \nIn investing for 10-15 years the concepts of good and bad time lose their relevance. Because for such a long period of time stocks can fall and rise 100 times.  But if we speak about from 1 to 6 months trading, it is very important to choose the right moment. Because you need to earn money rather quickly and you want to earn more, of course.  \nFor the sake of simplicity let's consider 2 companies: META and AAPL.   \nBoth of them have a beautiful growing chart for the last year of trading, but you should not buy both companies now, if you take them for a short term.  \nThe fact is that META and AAPL stocks are at their all-time highs right now. They have rallied strongly over the past couple months and there will soon be a period when the price will be corrected. Since there is no one chart in the market that is a forever rising straight line. There will always come moments of correction. And if you buy their stocks now, you are very likely to buy at the most expensive price in recent times.  \nThat's why it's important to learn how to analyze charts and choose the moments to buy or sell smartly.",

I asked all of his relatives to pick any stock or whatever, and then I bought fractional shares to spread out the $1K. I have a record of each initial stock purchase price (people picked everything from stuff that was hot then like NET, SPCE and PLTR to things they thought he'd identify with as he got older like DIS and NKE). Others played it safe and picked mutual funds. Anyway, the 'purity' of the initial $1K is gone because I've added more money (in small amounts) as people have given additional monetary birthday gifts etc. So now I have an imbalanced mishmash. I've been putting the 'new' money in safe places -- specifically VOO, SPY and BRKB. The total is still only about $2K but over the next 18 years I expect to continue to put modest amounts in and I am curious what people think. Should I hammer one mutual fund or spread it around?

    "title": "Offsetting Previous Losses While Continuing to Invest for the Future",
    "selftext": "Hello, I am looking for some advice on smart investment strategies to offset my previous $100k loss against my recent capital gains for tax purposes.\r  \n\r  \nIn 2020 and 2021, I made some poor decisions by getting involved in risky options trading without fully understanding the downsides. Over time, I ended up losing around $100,000 from these trades (short-term). It was completely due to my own ignorance and mistakes. After 2021, I realized option trading was not appropriate for me, so I stopped all forms of trading to focus on my career. Over the next six months, I worked hard to improve my skillset for better career opportunities and landed a well-paying job with potential growth prospects. In early 2023, I invested $70k into NVDA, NFLX, GOOGL, and AAPL stocks. Fortunately, that $70,000 investment is now worth around $112k. I also received $17k worth of vested RSUs from my current employer which is now worth around $20k.\r  \n\r  \nAdditional Info:\r\n\n* Married couple (36M, 32F) with a 3-year-old child, living in California (rented).\r\n* Combined household income is \\~$420k ($370k base salary + $50k RSUs).\r\n* Retirement Savings: 401k - $300k; Taxable Investments - $120k; Vested RSUs - $20k + $55k (spouse)\r\n* 529 College Savings Plan - $7k, contribute $3k per year.\r\n\nPrevious Capital Losses:\r\n\n* In last 2 years, deducted $6k capital losses on tax returns.\r\n* Have $94k remaining capital losses carried forward per 2022 tax filing.\r\n\nQuestions:\r\n\n1. If I sell my NVDA, NFLX, GOOGL, AAPL shares with $42k ($112k-$70k) capital gains, the gains would be offset by my carried forward losses from previous years and I would not owe any taxes on it. The remaining $52k ($94k-$42k) losses could still be carried forward. Is this understanding, correct?\r\n2. Does it make sense to realize the $42k short term capital gains to offset against losses, even though normally I'd owe taxes on short term gains?\r\n3. Is it advisable to sell my vested RSUs, realizing $3k capital gains, to also offset against my carried forward capital losses? This would leave me with $49k ($52k-$3k) losses still.\r\n4. Would the gains from my $300k Fidelity T-bills (maturing Mar/Apr 2024) also be eligible to offset against capital losses? If not, should I buy more T-bills after maturity? Context - I plan to use this for a house purchase downpayment in mid-2025.\r\n5. For short term savings goals (1-1.5 years), are T-bills the optimal way to get guaranteed returns? Given my losses, are there better alternatives with comparable returns I should consider?\r\n6. I'm unsure how investments like VUSXX, SGOV, BIL, USFR, TFLO compared to T-Bills in Fidelity. Could I purchase these instead for short term savings goals? Would these help recover my losses faster?\r\n7. I know my losses carry forward each year deducting $3k in taxes until fully utilized. Without offsetting gains, it would take 31+ years at $3k/year ($94k/3k). If there is any advice on any other ways to recover these losses faster, kindly feel free to suggest.",

Whether it's adjusting the allocation of assets, exploring new investment avenues, or any other valuable tips you might have, I'm all ears!\n\nHere's a snapshot of my current portfolio:\n\n## Individual - TOD\n\n|Account Name|Symbol|Description|Quantity|Percent Of Account|Current Value|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|TOD|SCHD|SCHWAB US DIVIDEND EQUITY ETF|133.983|52.79%|$10,212.13|\n|TOD|FXAIX|FIDELITY 500 INDEX FUND|37.677|32.05%|$6,200.12|\n|TOD|QYLD|GLOBAL X FDS NASDAQ 100 COVER|84.422|7.50%|$1,450.36|\n|TOD|FENY|FIDELITY MSCI ENERGY INDEX ETF|23.58|2.85%|$552.24|\n|TOD|EGY|VAALCO ENERGY INC ISIN #US91851C2017 SEDOL #BP6DQ87|98.525|2.38%|$460.11|\n|TOD|FTEC|FIDELITY MSCI INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY INDEX ETF|1.882|1.35%|$260.83|\n|TOD|CRON|CRONOS GROUP INC COM NPV ISIN #CA22717L1013 SEDOL #BF01YS3|51|0.55%|$107.10|\n|TOD|CNBS|AMPLIFY ETF TR SEYMOUR CANNBS|14.865|0.32%|$61.24|\n|TOD|SPAXX\\*\\*|HELD IN MONEY MARKET|\\-|0.26%|$50.21|\n|TOD|NMG|NOUVEAU MONDE GRAPHITE INC COM NPV (POST REV SPLIT)|12|0.16%|$30.06|\n|TOD|ENZC|ENZOLYTICS INC COM|310|0.04%|$6.78|\n|TOD|MU|MICRON TECHNOLOGY INC|0.029|0.01%|$2.38|\n|TOD|HMNY|HELIOS & MATHESON ANALYTICS IN COM|16|0.00%|$0.00|\n\n## ROTH IRA\n\n|Account Name|Symbol|Description|Quantity|Percent Of Account|Current Value|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|ROTH IRA|FXAIX|FIDELITY 500 INDEX FUND|48.212|24.76%|$7,933.76|\n|ROTH IRA|FTEC|FIDELITY MSCI INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY INDEX ETF|56.502|24.44%|$7,830.83|\n|ROTH IRA|MSFT|MICROSOFT CORP|9.646|11.22%|$3,594.09|\n|ROTH IRA|SCHD|SCHWAB US DIVIDEND EQUITY ETF|46.71|11.11%|$3,560.21|\n|ROTH IRA|FELC|FIDELITY ENHANCED LARGE CAP CORE ETF|59.718|4.89%|$1,566.40|\n|ROTH IRA|FDRV|FIDELITY ELECTRIC VEHICLES AND FUTURE TRANSPORTATION ETF|77.918|3.91%|$1,252.14|\n|ROTH IRA|SONY|SONY GROUP CORPORATION SPON ADS EACH REPR 1 ORD SHS|12.737|3.68%|$1,178.55|\n|ROTH IRA|O|REALTY INCOME CORP COM|19.903|3.57%|$1,144.16|\n|ROTH IRA|ICLN|ISHARES TR GL CLEAN ENE ETF|59.216|2.76%|$883.50|\n|ROTH IRA|AAPL|APPLE INC|3.496|2.01%|$642.89|\n|ROTH IRA|UMC|UNITED MICR ELCTRNS ADR REP 5 ORD|78.216|1.98%|$634.33|\n|ROTH IRA|PFE|PFIZER INC|15.71|1.46%|$467.68|\n|ROTH IRA|OSS|ONE STOP SYS INC COM|160.042|1.05%|$336.88|\n|ROTH IRA|ALAR|ALARUM TECHNOLOGIES LTD SPON ADS EACH REP 10 ORD SHS (POST SPLT)|27|0.77%|$247.05|\n|ROTH IRA|HAIL|SPDR SER TR S&P KENSHO SMART|7.978|0.73%|$235.43|\n|ROTH IRA|PSIL|ADVISORSHARES TR PSYCHEDELICS ETF|87.085|0.39%|$123.93|\n|ROTH IRA|EVGO|EVGO INC CL A COM|35.456|0.35%|$110.80|\n|ROTH IRA|NIO|NIO INC SPON ADS EACH REP 1 ORD SHS CLASS A|9.22|0.24%|$76.69|\n|ROTH IRA|LCID|LUCID GROUP INC COM|17.443|0.22%|$71.42|\n|ROTH IRA|PTN|PALATIN TECHNOLOGIES INC COM NEW|13|0.15%|$47.06|\n|ROTH IRA|VYM|VANGUARD WHITEHALL FDS HIGH DIV YLD|0.364|0.13%|$40.66|\n|ROTH IRA|JNJ|JOHNSON & JOHNSON COM USD1.00|0.185|0.09%|$29.73|\n|ROTH IRA|ABAT|AMERICAN BATTERY TECHNOLOGY COM NEW|4|0.05%|$17.32|\n|ROTH IRA|AIRI|AIR INDS GROUP COM|4|0.04%|$12.97|\n|ROTH IRA|ONL|ORION OFFICE REIT INC COM|1.076|0.02%|$5.99|\n|ROTH IRA|VYST|VYSTAR CORP COM NEW|10|0.00%|$0.88|\n|ROTH IRA|FDRXX\\*\\*|HELD IN MONEY MARKET|\\-|0.00%|$0.12|\n|ROTH IRA|PASO|PATIENT ACCESS SOLUTIONS INC|5000|0.00%|$0.00|\n|ROTH IRA|703CNT014|PATIENT ACCESS RR CONTRA|1|0.00%|n/a|\n|ROTH IRA|55404P100|MYDX INC COM|5000|0.00%|n/a|\n|ROTH IRA|DECN|DECISION DIAGNOSTICS CORP COM USD0.001|4250|0.00%|$0.00|\n\n## 401K\n\n|Account Name|Symbol|Description|Quantity|Percent Of Account|Current Value|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|401K|NON40OO9U|TARGETRETIREMENT2060|5623.121|57.22%|$102,087.75|\n|401K|FNSFX|FID FREEDOM 2060 K|5926.754|42.78%|$76,336.59|\n\n## Uniform Transfers to Minors (UTMA)\n\n|Account Name|Symbol|Description|Quantity|Percent Of Account|Current Value|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|UTMA|VOO|VANGUARD INDEX FUNDS S&P 500 ETF USD|1.459|99.90%|$629.67|\n\nThank you in advance for your time and advice!",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone, I have a question regarding generating income to allow myself to contribute to my Roth IRA. For context I\u2019m currently in graduate school and am no longer working. The past two years I\u2019ve worked and been able to max out my Roth contributions while not making enough to be taxed when filing. I currently have ~35000 dollars in a brokerage account. I have made 808 taxable dollars in dividends and that is my only income for the year. I would like to try and contribute more than that. So I was wondering if it is possible (legal?) to sell all of my current long term investments that are positive then reinvest them. If I did this I would net ~5200 as income bumping me up to around 6000 to contribute to my Roth. Am I allowed to just sell my current gains and repurchase their positions, or does that form a sort of wash for tax purposes? If not could I potentially pivot to different holdings? If that is possible is there any other way I could generate the extra 500$ dollars of apparent income to max my contribution? Thanks in advance. \n\nHoldings in question for sale would be \nMsft\nAAPL\nSpy \nNOW\nQqq\nVGT",

For the most part, I am a buy and hold investor after a year or two of trying my hand at day trading with options and futures. When you chase the money, you won't make it. But if you\u2019re patient with a decent risk tolerance, anything is possible. \n\n\n\nEdit: Wow, thanks for the up votes everyone. It\u2019s been fun reading the comments. Adding some context here based on some of the questions that have come in. Monthly contributions are at $1,000 a month now, but in the early years they were less. When I first started, it was $100 a month and I worked my way up from there. There was a good chunk of time where they were between $200-$500 a month. These accounts were set up on my own, no employer match. I\u2019m not sure what my lifetime performance is, but the last three years I\u2019m up 30% overall. All that in mind, I can confidently say that well over half of my account is due to investment gains. \n\nInvestments have been all individual stocks that I typically hold for a year or longer. I pick them based on both technical and fundamental factors. This is more risky than ETFs and index funds but it suits my investing style and risk tolerance. I try to stick to profitable companies with a stock price that has a history of moving in the right direction, however I also like to buy at a discount price. I keep my eyes on charts and when there\u2019s opportunities to buy at historically undervalued prices I jump on it. There\u2019s really nothing super special to it. Not going to share my current exact portfolio, but stocks I have owned in the past or currently include AAPL, GOOGL, META, COST, HD, MCD, DKNG, AMD, DIS, and BAC to name a few. There are many others I\u2019m interested in buying that are on my watchlist.\n\nI will also add that I\u2019ve made a ton of mistakes along the way. Bad investments, selling too soon when I should of just held, taking risky, over leveraged day trades that resulted in nasty losses and wash sales. However, I\u2019ve learned from them and never done anything bad enough that blew an account or resulted in a draw down that couldn\u2019t be recovered. You can read all the books you want but I\u2019ve always found that the best way is to learn by doing and over time you develop your own skills and are able to trust your own analysis and decisions.",

Some individual stocks are down 55-70% YTD; few are in the black. Just about every stock is performing worse than its respective market index. \n\nIn the case of the biggest losers, the chief investment officer basically went to the sunk cost fallacy - we (I) have lost so much we should just hold to see what can be recovered.  \n\nRight now I\u2019m so angry about today\u2019s loss (I didn\u2019t mention the stock that lost 25% yesterday) that I dare not call or email until I can get a grip on my emotions.\n\nI know that maybe except for the S&P 500, the market\u2019s performance has not been great this year, but my portfolio\u2019s losses just seem so extreme that I think I need to stop working with these folks. \n\nAny constructive advice?

I have been risk averse, so most of it is in Blue Chip Tech companies who are well positioned to take advantage of the upcoming technological revolutions but also have solid revenue making product moats. (MSFT, AAPL). I also have a HUGE unvested position in the AI revolution. So no more money in AI for me.\n\nAs I look towards diversifying my portfolio, I am struggling to find any industry that also meets the following demands:\n\n* Solid products that will make money today and 50 years from now\n* Sane P/E ratios (Keep it under 50 at least)\n* Poised to take advantage of one of the upcoming technological revolutions (ie. can expand their market)\n* Hard to beat Moat\n\nThe other industries that seem to have strong potential are the kind that have been losing money through the likes of Cathy Woods different ARK ETFs. All of Genomics, Drug Development, Space, 3D printing etc. are bleeding money by double digit percentages every year. Manufacturing companies are slowly revolutionizing, but I don't see their market expanding in a fashion that lets their stocks explode. Many others like mining & energy seem to be so heavily regulated, that your investment is more a reflection of trust in the political class than the actual industry. \n\nThe compute hardware industry makes sense to me, but I am already invested in non-Nvidia players and it is too close to Tech anyway. Novo Nordisk satisfied all those requirements, and I was planning on investing in it in January. Dragged my feet with it, and the train has passed.\n\nI can take risks. I am already maxing out my 401ks with safe index funds and I am 30 with my responsibilities paid off. But, don't say Crypto or weed-stocks. I have already been burned on both. I still maintain some crypto, but I am not changing my position on that. Either it all sinks or goes somewhere. Not an extra dollar in or out. Also, no Elon Musk companies please. Meme stocks aren't investments, it's gambling.\n\nTo me, genomics, drones (military) and surveillance are going to explode 10x at least in the next 10 years. I know founders in each of them, and have a strong intuition for the base technology. Not approaching it from a 'shiny new thing' perspective. But they are all so regulated and intertwined with Govts, that it is impossible to know who to put money on.",

Also seeking restructure/optimization advice on portfolio.)\n\nRecent dip in income, trying to change careers, housing projects coming due - running into a situation where I think it would be more beneficial to liquidate shares and park in a high yield savings acct for less volatility with all the uncertainty in my short term future. Would love advice on which stocks/ETFs y'all think I should sell off or just general advice on my situation. \n\nAssets: currently ~$7k in checking/savings with upcoming deposit of $14k landing in the next few weeks. Bank offers 2% APY and I know I can get better returns elsewhere, just haven't really bothered as I keep most of my \"long-term\" money in stocks.\n\nIncome: TBD. Mortgage loan officer and times are tough. Followed a college to a new job with promises of greener grass but it isn't looking good. Pursuing career change for more stability. May take a few months+ for earnings to align with my target again. Wife works salary job @ $90k/yr.\n\nExpenses: $2k/mo for my half of mtg + utilities + personal loan, $150 car payment. Round everything up and I'm probably $3k - $3,500/mo depending on how much fun I want to have on him weekends. \n\nSitting on a $20k loan for the home project that I'm splitting payments on with the wife. Estimating another ~$10k+ on top for total project completion that will most likely come out of my pocket. Rate is 13.49%. Once the dust settles on the project plan is to pay it off aggressively depending on income. Got the loan as wife doesn't have full cash on hand and I'd rather have a slow trickle from my account rater than large lump sum payout. \n\nGot Robinhood in 2020 and quickly realized I have no idea what I'm really doing. Most of my money  is in ETFs but I think there's a fair amount of redundancy in my holdings and I'd probably benefit from consolidating. Some accounts are positive, some negative.

Already maxing IRA and 401k so I consider my stocks to be more of a \"reserve\" account, ideally for long term growth but also access to additional funds if needed. Biggest fear I guess would be income stays low for a while while I figure things out, market tanks, now I'm selling stocks for pennies on the dollar to get by.\n\nMy thoughts/plan:\n\nSell off DAL, C, NDAQ, TAN, ICLN, & SCHD for a total of $9,153 and net loss of $289. This should cover most of the additional housing expenses and minimize losses.\n\nBut what would you do from there, especially if I'm anticipating a big reduction in income for the next 6 months?  Been considering selling everything besides (V)ETFs and then shaving off additional equity as needed but idk if that would be most prudent. \n\nThanks in advance.

Basically just trying to assess my exposure to different individual companies across all my ETFs.)*\n\nIs there any software that I can input my whole portfolio and it can then break everything down in terms of \"OK, across all your ETFs, individual stocks, etc ... you \"effectively own\" $50K of AAPL, 42K of XYZ, 31K of ABC, etc.\"\n\nMy assets are in Schwab and Fidelity ... I've played around and I can't seem to make these sites give me this breakdown.  They can analyze a few ways, but they can't seem to \"break open\" the ETF to say \"yes, you own $100K of SPY ... but that means you effectively own $3K of AAPL\" or whatever.\n\nI know I could go into every single ETF fact sheet and pull out the percentages and do the math myself, but this would be a ton of work.",

    "selftext": "My fiduciary is proposing rebalancing my portfolio which was inherited and currently focused on wealth maintenance rather than growth, but I\u2019m not experienced and have no clue if what is being suggested makes sense. I\u2019m 43 yr old, will have a pension upon retirement, have around $250,000 in high yield savings, my home is paid, no debt except for around 23k in student loans with low interest. Wife has around 160k in a 401k. \nMain goals for this portfolio are retirement income and I would like to be tax smart:\n\n-BrandywineGLOBAL Corporate Credit\nBCGIX MF 15%\n-Vanguard Total Bond Market BND ETF 15%\n-Vanguard Value VTV ETF 15%\n-Apple AAPL Stock 14%\n-Berkshire Hathaway BRKB Stock 10%\n-Vanguard Health Care VHT ETF 10%\n-Vanguard S&P 500 VOO ETF 10%\n-Vanguard Total World Market VTV ETF 5%\n-Vanguard Utilities VPU ETF 5%\n-Fidelity Government Capital Reserves FZAXX\nMF 1%\n\nWhile the portfolio allocation propsed above has historically generated near or above stock market level performance while taking significantly less risk (which is a good thing), one of my concerns for your account is to reposition the assets to a more tax-efficient allocation.  One of the ways to achieve this is in a taxable account using ETF\u2019s for stock-oriented investments as opposed to mutual funds.  Mutual funds are required to pay out to shareholders and capital gain distributions from mutual funds which result in a taxable event.  Over the past two years your  account has generated taxable capital gain distributions of $8,000- $10,000 annually.  ETFs and individual stocks do not have to follow the same tax rules that apply to mutual funds, and therefore instead of paying out capital gain distributions to shareholders, they take the gains generated by the sale of stocks and just purchase more stocks.  Since the capital gain distribution is not paid out to you the result is avoidance of taxation.    \n \nThe value of a couple stock oriented investments in your account have increased in value so if we were to sell the shares of those investments to rebalance  it would result in a capital gain of approximately $11,000\u00b1 for 2023 taxes, but then going forward we no longer have those annual tax burdens.\n\nDoes the above sound ok? Or what should I be asking him?  I am trying to learn about investing instead of relying on Reddit but it\u2019s a slow process so I appreciate this forum.\n\nThanks!",

On a call with analysts Apple CFO Luca Maestri said **the company expects revenue for these products to fall by double digits from last year**, citing pent-up demand from the prior year quarter after factory shutdowns.\r  \n\r  \nServices did better however my big question is if this really can compensate if Apple's hardware sales keep slumping? Quite frankly i don't understand why people keep buying the same iphone every year or maybe they no longer do? It's time Apple steps up its iphone and other hardware innovation instead of just repackaging the same thing every year with minor-to-no updates.\n\nPS. anybody else would wanna see a macbook (pro) **with touchscreen**? Personally i love my Dell XPS 13 4K with touchscreen and love the dimensions are only 30x20cm. Would love to see Apple making something similar. ",

So, say I put $10k in the market, and it goes to $12k, and then in April I sell $10k worth to pay taxes and leave the 2K profit in the market long-term, what are the tax implications? I will likely hold the shares for less than a year. TIA.",

TSLA may also see a small downward weighting. Smaller stocks should see a small increase in the weight.\n\nETFs/mutual funds that try to follow the Nasdaq 100 (such as $QQQ) will need to adjust their holdings accordingly. So you should expect them to sell the largest stocks and buy the smaller ones -- perhaps they already have -- and that will affect the prices of those stocks accordingly.\n\nIt also means that those ETFs/mutual funds will not accurately reflect the relative weight of the largest stocks. So if you wish to be weighted according to actual market cap, you would need to supplement those holdings.\n\nNormally the index rebalances every quarter. But the largest stocks are dominating the index and funds that follow the index need to maintain compliance with a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rule on fund diversification. On July 3, the largest six stocks saw their combined weight reach 50.9% of the index.\n\nRead more in this [Reuters \"Explainer\"](https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/what-is-nasdaqs-special-rebalancing-its-impact-2023-07-11/) or [Bloomberg article](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-10/big-tech-s-dominance-in-stock-market-hits-breaking-point-for-nasdaq-100) (paywall) or Matt Levine's [Money Stuff newsletter](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2023-07-11/matt-levine-s-money-stuff-elon-musk-blames-the-lawyers) (paywall/signup)",

While it is normal to see emerging companies being innovative and investors looking for opportunities, it can also be seen that companies such as MSFT, GOOGL, AAPL, AMZN are heavily invested into the idea, particularly MSFT with its continuous investment into OpenAI.\n\nI don't see AI being an investment fad, for a lack of a better term, like it can be argued that blockchain, cryptocurrencies or NFTs were at some point. With that, I am mostly referring to ordinary investors that would invest in such assets on a long-term basis rather than traders looking for large returns with any of the financial instruments at their disposal.\n\nGiven the fact that the companies mentioned above already represent a fair share of the S&P 500 index, is it safe to assume that any potential global breakthrough in AI is going to affect the value of any relevant ETFs since we do not know which of those major companies is going to be the first/best to reap the benefits of AI? Or the more risky approach of picking stocks like MSFT and emerging companies is more likely to be more profitable?\n\nSome may argue that a breakthrough in AI R&D is imminent but that it might actually result in a dot-com bubble-like crash because the current market prices have already factored in the expectation of larger returns which may or may not actually happen with AI.\n\nIn a nutshell, can S&P 500 ETF investing reap the benefits of a potential AI revolution or investors still have to take the risk and pick individual stocks? Can a crash of S&P 500 value be expected because some sectors could potentially lose value with AI or the prices are already too ambitious with some expectations on AI?",

    "selftext": "Hi! I\u2019m 26 yrs old living in South East Texas. I make $53560/yr. I max out my Roth IRA and my job puts away for retirement, as well. I have a nest egg that is roughly 4 months of living expenses. I also have a brokerage account with around $7000 in it, this is invested in primarily the S&P500, AAPL, and a clean energy fund with smaller holdings in a sports gambling ETF and a space technology ETF\n\nI currently own a home that I bought with a state grant. I used that grant to put down ~7% on a 200,000 home and have a 30 yr note with about a $1400 payment currently (that\u2019s principal, interest, taxes, and insurance). My girlfriend of 6 yrs and I split this payment and all other expenses 50/50\n\nMy current goal is to get rid of my PMI. My current trajectory is no more PMI in May 2030. My PMI is $101 a month.\n\nI have 3 things to consider to help me do that faster. \n\nI am getting a 4% raise. I am considering taking that money (roughly $70/pay check or ~$2000/yr) and putting it towards the house. This would put me ahead by 24 months of payments. This would save me 2424 in the log run, not to mention the interest I\u2019d save.\n\nI have $7000 invested with no goal for it. I could pull that and put it towards the house. This would put me 22 months ahead of schedule, and I could invest the new money and rebuild just the same. Which would save me 2222 including the interest difference.\n\nFinally, I could do both. Doing both would put me 40 months ahead of schedule. Which would save me 4,040, plus all the interest.\n\nIs it worth doing this? Or should I just invest the $70/paycheck and let that continue to move?\n\nBonus question, what do you use your brokerage investments for? I\u2019ve never really had a goal for mine and the last time I sold was to pay off my car in late 2020.\n\nThanks for the input!\n\nEdit: home was bought in September 2021 at 4% interest",

    "selftext": "I'm developing an application related to ETF portfolios (the goal is to be able to analyze intersection, diversification between countries, categories, portfolio trend \\[small to large, value to growth map\\], etc).\n\nAnyway. An ETF that I really like is **AVGE**, from Avantis. If I could summarize it in a few words, it would be the \"VT with tendency to the value factor\". It is a \"fund of funds\" with the following composition:\n\n* Avantis U.S. Equity ETF (42.78%)\n* Avantis U.S. Large Cap Value ETF (15.05%)\n* Avantis International Equity ETF (10.89%)\n* Avantis Emerging Markets Equity ETF (6.37%)\n* Avantis International Large Cap Value ETF (5.49%)\n* Avantis U.S. Small Cap Value ETF (4.95%)\n* Avantis U.S Small Cap Equity ETF (4.86%)\n* Avantis Emerging Markets Value ETF (4.28%)\n* Avantis Real Estate ETF (3.00%)\n* Avantis International Small Cap Value ETF (2.17%)\n* State Street Institutional Investment Trust US Government Money Market Fund Institutional (0.09%)\n\nI got this information from the website [etf.com/avge](https://etf.com/avge). But I would like to go further. I would not like to see the funds that make up these funds, I want to see the holdings that make up the funds of that fund.\n\nSo, with a little bit of programming I was able to extract this information and publish it in this github repository. There are two CSV, of which:\n\n* [avge-holdings-ungrouped.csv](https://github.com/victornoleto/avge-holdings/blob/master/avge-holdings-ungrouped.csv): In this CSV I have not grouped the repeated companies. You will be able to see the weight of each holding in each of the funds. Example: APPL represents 4.78% of AVUS (which represents 42.78% of AVGE) and at the same time represents 2.98% of AVLV (which represents 15.05% of AVGE).\n* [avge-holdings-grouped.csv](https://github.com/victornoleto/avge-holdings/blob/master/avge-holdings-grouped.csv): This CSV shows the actual participation of a given company in AVGE. So, for example, the APPL that is part of AVUS and AVLG, its real weight is 2.49% (4.78%\\*42.78% + 2.98%\\*15.05%).\n\nAnd, just to make the post more graphic, I end with the list of the 10 biggest AVGE positions.\n\n|Name|Ticker|Weight|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Apple Inc.|AAPL|2.49%|\n|Microsoft Corporation|MSFT|1.56%|\n|Exxon Mobil Corporation|XOM|0.92%|\n|Meta Platforms Inc. Class A|META|0.85%|\n|JPMorgan Chase & Co|JPM|0.80%|\n|Chevron Corporation|CVX|0.77%|\n|Merck & Co., Inc|MRK|0.76%|\n|Alphabet Inc. Class A|GOOGL|0.63%|\n|Pfizer Inc|PFE|0.56%|\n|Alphabet Inc. Class C|GOOG|0.55%|\n\nThe fund's 10 largest positions add up to **9.91%**. It's a pretty small value when compared to growth ETFs like QQQ, VUG, etc.\n\n# Next goals (which I will do when I have time):\n\n* Compare the percentage portfolio between AVGE and VT;\n* Get the country and sector of each of the 9824 holdings. In this way I will be able to carry out a study of the geographic and sectorial diversification of AVGE. I'll probably use ChatGPT to help me with this because I haven't found any api that can give me this information easily.",

    "selftext": "From [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/apple-to-spend-billions-more-on-entertainment-7370447)\n\n\"Apple Inc. (AAPL), the world's most valuable company, is mulling a billion-plus dollar foray into movie theaters and sports streaming in an attempt to drive subscriber growth for its Apple TV+ streaming platform.\n\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\nApple could spend more than $1 billion a year to ramp up its movie releases and sports streaming.\n\nThe company is reportedly in talks with film studios to partner on theatrical releases of movies by Martin Scorsese and Ridley Scott.\n\nPreviously, Apple has devoted most of its $6.5 billion film and TV budget to television programs.\n\nThe move could help to drive viewers to Apple's streaming platform, Apple TV+, which lags far behind competitors like Amazon and Netflix.\n\nApple is expected to spend $1 billion a year to produce movies for theatrical release. \n\nThe company is reportedly in talks with movie studios to partner on the releases of upcoming movies by Martin Scorsese, Ridley Scott, and others.\n\nThe company is also reportedly considering bidding on the streaming rights to English football games.\n\n\nThe new plans constitute a significant increase in Apple's entertainment spending that could be part of an effort to draw more interest in Apple TV+, which lags behind rivals in subscriptions. Apple TV+ has an estimated 40 million subscribers, compared with at least 200 million each for Amazon's (AMZN) Prime Video and Netflix (NFLX).\n\n\nApple also lags behind rivals in content spending. The company spent about $6.5 billion on movies and television in 2021, while Amazon and Netflix spent $9 billion and $17 billion respectively.\n\n\nSo far, Apple's greatest streaming success has been in television, with the acclaimed series Ted Lasso. The business of releasing movies for wide theatrical distribution may be more complex, particularly given theater chains' struggles to rebound from COVID-19 and fend off competition from streaming services. Movie ticket sales are about a third below 2019 levels. Chains like AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. (AMC) have attributed the sluggish sales to a shortage of available films.\n\nApple's distribution agreements may help boost ticket sales, and it is not the only tech company entering theaters. Amazon acquired major studio Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer for $8.5 billion last year and now plans to make up to 15 movies for theatrical release each year. \n\nIn each case, Apple and Amazon may attempt to drive streaming viewership by later releasing those films on their respective platforms.\n\nApple's interest in adding English football games to its streaming platform follows last year's $2.5 billion 10-year streaming deal with U.S. Major League Soccer. Terms of a potential deal between Apple and the UK's Premier League have not been disclosed.\"\n\nPersonally, this sounds like the kind of move that more streamers (looking at you, Netflix) need to make. They aren't going to be throwing ridiculous money at it, but the content they are looking to produce is starting to look more like HBO level quality. If they have acclaimed directors like Scorsese and Ridley Scott on board, they could get their films in with a big theatrical release, make a shit tonne of money, THEN bring it onto streaming (much like Paramount did with Top Gun Maverick) for a bigger subscriber gain. Sounds like a win win win to me and we all know Apple has $billions in pocket change to throw at this.",

    "title": "Analysis of an Analyst Raising Apple target to $190",
    "selftext": "Full Article: [https://www.marketwatch.com/story/apples-stock-gains-after-one-of-wall-streets-biggest-bulls-gets-a-little-more-bullish-83601f35](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/apples-stock-gains-after-one-of-wall-streets-biggest-bulls-gets-a-little-more-bullish-83601f35)\n\nEssentially in his forecast driven by high iPhone demand in china and steady sales in January through February, Market Analyst Dan Ives reiterated the outperform rating he\u2019s had on Apple for at least the past three years. He raised his stock-price target to $190 from $180, with the new target implying about 25% upside from current levels. Why so optimistic? Is that realistic? And if so over what time frame are we talking here?\n\nMy analysis is mainly being drawn from [this data here](https://www.pluto.fi/stock/AAPL) (great resource for well compiled company data) as well as my knowledge of the company and other articles I've perused during this endeavor.\n\nThe synopsis forecast on the stock report card linked is: \"41 analysts offer 12-month price forecasts for AAPL. Together, they have an average target of 179.88, the most optimistic forecast put AAPL at 210 within 12-months and the most pessimistic has AAPL at 140.\"\n\nTheir recent low came at the end of December after [pretty bad holiday sales](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/apple-earnings-fall-short-on-underwhelming-sales-of-iphones-and-macs-11675373982) but those seem to mainly have been do to continued production disruption rather than low demand. This was also the only quarter in the last 20 in which they have missed earnings. So I would argue these are strong indicators that we won't be seeing it drop to 140.\n\nApple is also diversifying its supply chain so over time and without another pandemic, those disruptions should become less frequent and impactful.\n\nLike I mentioned before, this isn't the only article I've seen recently where analysts are targeting Apple for the $190 to $210 range and I think if there is any solid movement on the rumored AR headset or (much less likely) the Apple Car, we could easily see a rally over the next year or two, to the proposed prices.\n\nLast year apple hit a high of $179 so it wasn't far off from this target. Even with all the tech layoffs and seeming bubble bursting of that sector, Apple hasn't had. mass layoffs and is still increasing its historic and investor friendly [stock buyback program](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/03/apples-3-trillion-market-cap-shows-value-of-share-buybacks-dividend.html).\n\nMost of the company's prospects are good and they get a solid B rating in the report card above, but they have been very volatile over the last year (volatility grade of C) going from a one year high of 179 and a low of around 125.\n\nI definitely think they as a company can reach those targets, but I wonder if they can reach them in the proposed 12 month time frame given current market conditions. Tech is being rocked, interest rates are going to keep going up for a while now, inflation has been hurting consumers and I wonder if demand for big ticket items like iPhones/macs will continue even if they don't raise prices (which I don't think they will or need to). If anyone can weather the storm of pending recession its Apple, but will they continue to be a beacon of growth during this time and reach these targets despite the rest of the market or are they going to trade sideways for a while and only break out when the rest of the market also starts to rally? What do you think? Especially curious to hear from others who have a solid amount of Apple in their portfolio?",

    "selftext": "Over the last five years, this Warren Buffett stock has risen over 240%. And it will likely continue soaring over the next five years.\n\nAccording to one account, Warren Buffett first invested in Apple (AAPL 3.71%) in 2016 after hearing how devastated a Berkshire Hathaway director was after losing their iPhone in a taxi ride. The director described the experience saying, \"I felt like I lost a piece of my soul.\" The anecdote prompted Buffett to take a closer look at Apple, and ultimately determine its products had become indispensable to many people.\n\nSince then, Apple has become 38% of Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio, by far the largest holding. The second biggest is Bank of America at 10.6%.The iPhone company displays many characteristics Buffett looks for in a strong investment, including strong leadership, consistent long-term growth, and unique products that encourage brand loyalty. \n\nHere's why Apple is one Warren Buffett stock to buy hand over fist in 2023. \n\nApple is the king of consistency and reliability \n\nA stock market sell-off in 2022 led the Nasdaq-100 Technology Sector index to plunge 40% throughout the year as macroeconomic headwinds significantly reduced consumer demand. The economically challenging year highlighted the importance of Buffett's long-term approach to investing (the investor is often quoted as saying, \"If you aren't willing to own a stock for 10 years, don't even think about owning it for 10 minutes\"). And Apple's stock is a strong candidate for a long-term hold. \n\nApple shares sank 27% in 2022 but rose 244% over the last five years. Meanwhile, the company's revenue increased 48% since 2018 to $394 billion, and operating income has soared 81% to $119.44 billion in the same period.\n\nThe company's consistent growth is largely owed to the high demand for its products and services. According to Counterpoint Research, in 2022, Apple officially overtook Alphabet's Android in smartphone market share by crossing 50%. The achievement is especially powerful in Apple's hands, with its walled garden of products that encourages consumers to sink deeper into its ecosystem with just one purchase.\n\nMoreover, as Counterpoint Research director Jeff Fieldhack pointed out, \"operating systems are like religions -- never significant changes.\"  Consequently, the more consumers there are using iPhones, the more products the company is likely to sell over the long haul as people upgrade to new versions and other Apple products with a similar design language.\n\nApple's excellent outlook, despite a potentially weak Q1 \n\nApple is scheduled to release its results for its first quarter of fiscal 2023 on Feb. 2. Multiple analysts are projecting weak earnings after iPhone production issues last November led to insufficient supply during last year's holiday season. As a result, Refinitiv analysts expect the company to report just over $121 billion in revenue, a slight decline from the $123.9 billion in Q1 2022.\n\nHowever, as Buffett has stressed, a stock investment is not for short-term gains, and the company has made several moves to boost iPhone profits over the long term. Over the last month, Bloomberg has revealed that Apple is working toward maximizing operating income in its iPhone segment by leaning less on other tech companies for its components.\n\nChanges such as swapping telecom and WiFi/Bluetooth chips from suppliers Qualcomm and Broadcom for in-house versions, along with using custom-designed displays in lieu of Samsung and LG Display screens, will significantly cut down costs. Additionally, Apple is working toward improving aspects of the iPhone's OS, such as maps, search, and advertising, to create less necessity for Google apps. As the iPhone made 52% of the company's revenue in 2022, Apple is wise to maximize the segment's profits where it can. \n\nThe tech giant is further safeguarding its business over the long term by diversifying revenue with its swiftly growing services business. Apple services delivered a profit margin of 71.7% in 2022, compared to products' profit margin of 36.3%. Meanwhile, services revenue grew 14% year over year, double the iPhone's growth. \n\nWhile Apple could be in for a challenging quarter and possibly year, its long-term outlook remains positive. The company has offered Berkshire Hathaway consistent gains since 2016 and is likely to continue doing so for the haul, making it a stock to buy hand over fist in 2023.",

    "title": "Tech growth stock portfolio reallocation and diversification out of Apple",
    "selftext": "I'm looking to create a portfolio with relatively safe tech growth stocks. I know that sounds like a bit of an oxymoron, but I'm looking to diversify out of my AAPL position. 77% of my portfolio is in the s&p 500. The rest is in AAPL.\n\nI don't think AAPL is going anywhere, and they obviously have a loyal customer base and I think Apple TV is putting out some great content. I also love how vertically integrated they are. That being said, I think they've reached market saturation in most areas and it seems the pace of innovation has slowed. I'm thinking about selling 50%+ of my AAPL position because over the years it has grown to represent 23% of my portfolio and that just seems like too much for any one individual stock.\n\nI'm considering divesting and reallocating into the following positions:\n\nGOOGL\nMSFT\nAMZN\nTSM\nNVDA\nMETA\nTSLA\n\n1. Google needs no introduction, but the stock is at super low p/e ratios and they continuously try (mostly unsuccessfully) to innovate across multiple sectors. Ads are obviously the bread and butter, but YouTube is the biggest threat to cable and streaming services. YouTube content is vast, high quality, and free!\n\n2. Microsoft is also at pretty low p/e ratios. Azure is #2 cloud service. Gaming sector is growing and Sony/PlayStation is falling behind. Biggest thing for me is their investment into AI tech such as OpenAI (aka chatGPT). Overall they have diverse revenue streams and continue to innovate.\n\n3. Amazon is not just ecommerce, but at absolute logistics giant. #1 cloud service. Decent streaming service. And they continuously reinvest into the company. They're also down more than others on this list in the past year.\n\n4. Taiwanese Semiconductor is the world's leading chip manufacturer. P/e is low, but partly because of inflated chip prices. Biggest fear is Chinese government interference, but the $40 billion investment into the Arizona factory is encouraging.\n\n5. Nvidia makes the most powerful chips in the world and has great partnerships with other leaders in tech. Also one of the leaders in AI technology. Downside is sky high p/e and it's down the least over the last year, so not the best value.\n\n6. META for me is the hardest to evaluate. On one hand Facebook and Instagram are absolute social media giants that print money, but on the other hand I don't see nearly as much potential for growth. VR technology is cool, but it's a long way away from being mainstream. If that ever happens, there's no guarantee that META will be the ones to do it.\n\n7. Tesla has obviously been hammered the most on this list, but I'm not sure it's totally warranted. Whatever Musk is doing at Twitter shouldn't really affect Tesla as much as it has. P/e ratio is back to reality somewhat and they continue to lead ev sales. Other manufacturers are struggling to catch up, it's happening, but much slower than anyone expected. If Tesla continues to keep it's foot on the gas and continues to improve it's qc and manufacturing processes, I see them remaining a leader in the ev field for years to come.\n\n\nSo Reddit, what do you think of my choices? And are there any other companies you think I missed and should look into? What percentage would you allocate into the above companies?",

However IMHO this will not be implemented until they are turning great profit and the share price is under valued. \n\n* AAPL has 17 billion shares outstanding and we have 960 million shares outstanding so no need for any future votes on RS when we are very profitable. It may take a while but worth getting in early. \n\n* Zomedica is up-listed on NYSE American and compliance is ONLY $.20. Meaning if the stock price stays above .20 cents it will not receive any deficiency notice from the Securities and Exchange Commission and exchange rules and regulations.",

However IMHO this will not be implemented until they are turning great profit and the share price is under valued. \n\nAAPL has 17 billion shares outstanding and we have 960 million shares outstanding so no need for any future votes on RS when we are very profitable. It may take a while but worth getting in early. \n\nZomedica is up-listed on NYSE American and compliance is ONLY $.20. Meaning if the stock price stays above .20 cents it will not receive any deficiency notice from the Securities and Exchange Commission and exchange rules and regulations.",

    "title": "[Serious] Why not a portfolio of 100% Apple?",
    "selftext": "Ok, so hear me out on this. This is something I've been thinking about and pondering for the past few weeks and it's an idea that I just can't get out of my head. \n\nSo most every person, myself included, when asked what someone should invest in will answer with the same thing: DCA into a diversified ETF like VTI or VOO and just let it ride. That's what I've been doing myself as it follows the conventional wisdom of not putting all your eggs into one basket, protecting yourself against massive market swings, and generally allowing an individual to take the emotion out of investing and slowly grow their wealth in a safe, predictable, and emotionless manor. \n\nBut here's the thing, Apple is already a massive percentage of all of the diversified ETFs we recommend, and it consistently outperforms them as well. \n\nI'm not able to share images, but tradingview offers this really cool comparison tool. If you type in AAPL/VOO you can see how valuable Apple is compared to VOO. Since VOO launched in 2010 AAPL is now sitting at 338% more valuable across 12 years. \n\nThen I start thinking about the broad income streams that Apple has. They have physical products, digital products, and subscriptions that generate consistent revenue. They pay a consistently increasing dividend quarterly and maintain massive market share by being, in my opinion, an \"affordable Veblen good\" or more simply put, a bit of a status symbol. Also, anecdotally, the last three companies I've worked for are using Apple hardware in their offices. It is the go-to computer for the tech-startup world.\n\nNow I know someone has already typed out a comment saying, \"past performance is not an indicator of future gains\" to which I say bullshit. The only reason we invest in companies, ETFs, or whatever else is because we look to the past and say, \"The line has gone up for the last 10 years, surely that means the line will continue to go up for the next 10 years.\"\n\nSo yeah, in all honesty, if you're planning on buying and holding for 30 years why would you not want to go all in on Apple?",

    "selftext": "[https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/27/apple-aapl-earnings-q4-2022.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/27/apple-aapl-earnings-q4-2022.html)\n\nHere is how Apple did versus Refinitiv consensus estimates:\u00a0\n\n* **EPS** $1.29 vs. $1.27 est.\u00a0\n* **Revenue**. $90.15 billion vs. $88.90 billion estimated, up 8.1% year-over-year\u00a0\n* **iPhone revenue:** $42.63 billion\u00a0vs. $43.21 billion estimated, up 9.67% year-over-year\u00a0\n* **Mac revenue:** $11.51 billion vs. $9.36 billion estimated, up 25.39% year-over-year\u00a0\n* **iPad\u00a0revenue**:\u00a0$7.17 billion\u00a0vs. $7.94 billion estimated, down 13.06% year-over-year\u00a0\n* **Other Products\u00a0revenue:**\u00a0$9.65 billion\u00a0vs. $9.17 billion estimated, up 9.85% year-over-year\u00a0\n* **Services revenue:** $19.19 billion vs. $20.10 billion estimated, up 4.98% year-over-year\u00a0\n* **Gross margin:** 42.3% vs. 42.1% estimate\n\nIf Q3 earnings already miss in important segments, Q4 certainly could be more problematic in a slowing economy with less demand.\n\n**Edit:** I live in Europe and because of high energy bills i know alot of people who this year won't buy things like a new iphone which can wait for next year when iphone will have the mandatory USB connector because of new EU regulations. Don't know about the US consumer but also in UK people are struggling with energy bills. Also China has its own set of problems, which Cook mentioned during the call.\n\nWould not be surprised to see an initial bounce followed by a pullback in coming days and weeks once big firm analists start lowering Q4 estimates, not just for Apple.",
