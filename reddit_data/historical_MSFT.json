    "title": "DD on $BITF - A Speculative, But Undervalued Company with the Potential to be the Next Big AI/HPC Infrastructure Play",
    "selftext": "Hello fellow regards,\n\nI am writing to you to inform you on the next best degen ticker for the most restarted regards. No financial advice here buddy, invest at your own risk.\u00a0\n\nBefore we get into Bitfarms (1W +70%, \\~$1bn Market Cap) it is important to get some context on the current AI Infrastructure landscape.\n\n* Nebius just struck a $17.4b deal, potentially rising up to $19.4b, with Microsoft to provide dedicated AI infrastructure over the next 5 years. Nebius rose 40% over the last week. Additionally, Q2 Revenue is up 106% quarter over quarter.\n* CoreWeave, not my favorite play, but has $30.1b in revenue backlog and contracts with Microsoft, OpenAI, Mistral, and others. CRWV is up 187% since their IPO in March.\n* Oracle has signed a $300b deal with OpenAI. Q2 cloud infra revenue is up 52% year over year. Oracle rose 38% over the last week.\n\nThis is just the start. There isn\u2019t enough compute to go around, hence the high revenue backlog and exorbitant amounts of CapEx spending.\n\nNow, where does BITF come in? This is supposedly just a BTC mining company. They have a proven capability of running profitable BTC mining data centers \u2013 their direct cost per BTC is $48.2k while their revenue per BTC is $98k (an almost 50% margin per BTC).\n\nI want to start by introducing the key risks before getting to my main investment thesis:\n\n* What BITF don\u2019t have currently is commited contracts/backlogs.\n* Additionally, there is an execution risk (obtaining power, permits, building cooling, fiber, ensuring reliability, acquiring GPUs or equivalent hardware, hiring skilled staff).\n* BITF has diluted shares in the past, but has completed a 4.9m+ share buy back.\n\nSo, I want to be clear, this is a speculative play for the most restarted regards. However, I do believe these risks will all be addressed.\n\nNow moving on to my bulll thesis:\n\nThey have demonstrated a clear willingness to shift their focus towards AI/HPC infrastructure. I introduce the Panther Creek data center campus in Pennsylvania.\u00a0\n\n* Pennsylvania is well known to be a haven for data center development. They are home to the PJM Interconnection (covers electricity market for 13 US states), so huge amounts of power at competitive pricing. Pennsylvania also generates tons of natural gas, nuclear and coal. In essence, PA offers abundant, low-cost energy, existing transmission, and favorable permitting as well.\n* The Panther Creek DC is expected to have between 350 \u2013 410 MW with full capacity expected to be reach by 2027.\n* T5 Data Centers is responsible for the buildout. This is a well reputed company in this space with 3 GW+ managed, 100% uptime since 2012, and 50+ data centers supported. \u00a0\n* In addition, they have secured additional prime data center land (Bitfarms Moses Lake Site) in Washington located in the largest data center cluster on the West Coast.\n* Another key point is they have significant access to financing ($230m in total liquidity) to make this high CapEx spend a reality. $8m in monthly FCF generation \u2013 this is almost $100m yearly and equivalent to almost a third of revenue.. Furthermore, they have secured $300m in debt from Macquarie (a bank focused on infrastructure finance). Also, they have their future non-core business of BTC mining to support CapEx spending.\n* It is a value play \u2013 yes, you heard me right. Yes, this stock also went up 70% over the past week. But BITF presents signifcantly lower multiples than comparable peers.\n   * BITF with 2.9x TEV/Revenue LTM compared to CLSK (6.33x), CRWV (23.59x), IREN (8.65x)\n   * TEV/Revenue NTM (next 12 months) at 1.65x for BITF compared to CLSK (3.31x), CRWV (9.95x), and IREN (3.36x)\n\nCan BITF 10x? Yes, it can. Can BITF go to bag-holder land? Yes, it can. Invest at your own risk.\n\nHave fun\n\nRegards,\n\nchecazzo\n\nSources: BITF (Q2 Presentation), NBIS (Q2 Presentation), NBIS (MSFT Press Release), CRWV (Q2 Presentation), ORCL (Q2 Press Release), Capital IQ (Multiples)\n\n\n\nScreenshot of Position Below:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bd8h4129knof1.png?width=1622&format=png&auto=webp&s=8230c6388fc11df54a1984cb9aba91581676e1b0",

    "title": "$GLXY $CRWV- A massive deal for StarGate between CoreWeave, Galaxy and a Hyperscaler - Additional New 2.7 GigaWatts of Power Unaccounted For",
    "selftext": "StarGate is here and one does not just bring on GigaWatts of power to a building without massive expertise, knowhow, land rights and government help for expediency on permitting. I have no idea on the timing of this but the tea leaves are all right in front of us.\n\n**TL;DR:** I believe a massive new deal is brewing for Giga-Scale AI Factory capacity between CoreWeave, Galaxy, and an AI HyperScaler. New Government regulations are lightspeeding the permitting process and allowing companies to start building while air permits are being obtained. This should lead to new massive deals sooner in the near term rather than later. Even if the projects are years out. Giga-Scale powered AI Factories are here and the opportunity has never been better for companies like Galaxy. The providers (OpenAI, MSFT, Google, AWS) don't want to be landlords or data center builders and the data center builders don't want to be landlords-This is where Galaxy fits in.\n\nFirst, who the hell is Galaxy and why are they important? Turns out, they are an up and coming Crypto (we have lots of space and power) to AI infrastructure play based out of Alfont, Texas.\n\nSpecifically, Helios is the is the campus where they have initial power and upcoming powered AI shells and newly closed land deals and power requests that are reportedly bringing **an additional 2.7 Gigawatts of fully functional powered AI GPU data center shells**.\n\nTo note, Oracle just closed a $300 Billion deal with OpenAI that is tied to StarGate and the quick notes on that are\n\n* 4.5 GigaWatts of power\n* Scheduled for first delivery by 2027\\*\n* $300 Billion contract over 5 years\n\nAgain, nobody just has GigaWatts of power on the US grid. It is rare earth mineral levels of concern right now. There is so much work and permitting on that amount of power scale that the government had to issue new executive orders to try and help expedite the process.\n\nFor Oracle they have about \\~$10 Billion in cash and they are [reportedly (Bloomberg) preparing a $38 Billion debt package from various banks](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-04/banks-ready-38-billion-of-debt-for-data-centers-tied-to-oracle). Roughly to get 4.5 GigaWatts of power is going to cost you about $38+($32B - $60B) Billion and yield you $300 Billion over 5 years... Not bad. And it gives us a baseline of how to think about this. **\\*Note this figure does not include Nvidia GPUS.** That's extra.\n\nFor Galaxy, they are already starting this process of bringing on massive new power for land acquisitions now giving them over 1500 sq acres of land in Texas with clearly the ability to add on more throughout the years even over the current amount. Literally, this is big new oil in the making right there in big ole Texas.\n\nHere's the kicker, CoreWeave has been buying all (100%) of their announced and soon to be ready power for their initial phases I,II,III of totalled 800 MW of active compute power.\n\nJust take a look of all the deals and power CoreWeave has committed to and it's not just partial. It's ALL OF IT.\n\n**CoreWeave & Galaxy / Helios Phases & Timing**\n\n* **Phase I**\n   * **Critical IT:** 133 MW | **Gross power:** \\~200 MW\n   * **Contract:** 15-yr lease signed **Mar 28, 2025**\n   * **Delivery window:** **1H 2026**\n   * **Sources:** Galaxy FY24/Q1\u201925 PR; Q2\u201925 call transcript.

[PR Newswire](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/galaxy-announces-second-quarter-2025-financial-results-302521785.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n2. **Campus, not a single deed:** Galaxy\u2019s April 23 release describes **800 MW gross already approved at the Helios project substation** (campus-level), and (at that time) **1.7 GW** more under load study. [Galaxy Digital](https://investor.galaxy.com/news/news-details/2025/Galaxy-Announces-Commitment-with-CoreWeave-to-Host-Additional-Artificial-Intelligence-and-High-Performance-Computing-Infrastructure-at-Helios-Data-Center-Campus/default.aspx)\n3. **Update on expansion pipeline:** By **Aug 15, 2025**, Galaxy says it has **2.7 GW of additional power capacity under various stages of load study**, with **potential to 3.5 GW** at full build-out; this is separate from (and **in addition to**) the 800 MW already contracted to CoreWeave. [Galaxy Digital](https://investor.galaxy.com/news/news-details/2025/Galaxy-Closes-1-4-Billion-Project-Financing-Facility-to-Accelerate-Helios-AI-Datacenter-Development/default.aspx)\n4. **New land + 1 GW interconnect request:** In the **Q2\u201925 earnings call**, Galaxy said it entered a **PSA for 160 acres** and submitted a **1 GW load interconnection request** adjacent to Helios (this 1 GW is part of the broader \u201cunder study\u201d pool). [Q4 CDN](https://s201.q4cdn.com/407453138/files/doc_financials/2025/q2/Galaxy-Digital-Inc-2Q25-Earnings-Transcript.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n\nThe question becomes - Who is committing to that additional 2.7 GigaWatts of power?\n\nAnd it's not just in Galaxies thoughts and ideas. They recently closed on land adjacent to Helios in 2024 of 160 acres and very recently an agreement mentioned in their Q2 earnings call alluded to another 160 acres is now a done deal. So from their Q2 we have an agreement to the now signed and recorded deed this is a very real acquisition and commitment for Galaxy. Especially, the 1 GW power interconnect request that came with the property.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y505m06zejof1.png?width=2305&format=png&auto=webp&s=bb8458d05d64a8369fd23786ab928b606ac02c26\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dk4gtg6zejof1.png?width=2317&format=png&auto=webp&s=b2bb232f8e1fd2f61dbbc0319c786c7b23ba50d3\n\nBoth of these deeds are from 2025 and are for the plots below in the large red square with green circles 33, 39 and I believe 37 give a total of another 160 acres. Everything that is highlighted or squared below is what Galaxy owns. The current Helios setup and committed 800 MW of active power is in the yellow square.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c14simu1fjof1.png?width=1248&format=png&auto=webp&s=ae1daeb6417548f90ef3474d5c99f17c95171cce\n\nEven the neighboring plots are just a bunch of old people selling farmland. So the question becomes. Who is Galaxy building all of that active powered AI ready shells for? Again, at every turn CoreWeave has been the one to buy up the leases at a 15 year commit.\n\nNow, if you remember there are additional tea leaves to follow here too. In the Q2 call Michael and team alluded to another extension that would be realized in Q3. We haven't heard about that as of yet. That is still a major Q3 catalyst we are all waiting for.\n\nWhat we also know is that yesterday at the Goldman Sachs conference call the CoreWeave team was asked a question, \"are there or do you see any more multi-billion dollar deals being done?\" How CoreWeave replied was telling, they neither confirmed nor denied but what they did say is this.\n\n* What they are seeing now is an inflection point in demand.\n* Customers are coming to them for longer contracts (extended time periods)\n* And customers are requesting the very highest end GPU's which are currently the GB Ultra 300's NVL72 racks.\n* **We talked to insiders and even the NBIS deal as large as it is still doesn't fix the problem - They need still need more**\n* **There is an insatiable demand for AI**\n\nTo me, what this is all saying is that reasoning models are burning through GPU's. Empirically I know this to be true but the comment from CoreWeave just outright confirms this. And to that point the very next hours of yesterday during Oracle's earnings call they reported a massive 300B data center deal and need.\n\nSo right there, only hours later another major multi-billion dollar deal was being done.\n\nAnd Michael alluded to that whatever the NBIS deal is that still isn't enough. But why? Reasoning models while so much better than before they are slower than hell at returning an answer. Sam Altman literally said, \"we have even way larger and better models but we don't have the capacity (GPU'S) to give them to you.\"\n\nTracking it all, there is still an insatiable demand and obvious capacity constraints.\n\nAgain, what is Galaxy doing buying all this land and land studying 2.7 GigaWatts of additional power for? To me, that has to be some NDA'd customer that is committing to that data center scale. So, why not CoreWeave? They are already a preferred customer and have commited to 800 MW already from Galaxy.\n\nAnd it gets even better.\n\nRemember that the US power grid is so strained right now anyone gaining access to it is basically given contract. Literally, that is the Vineland NJ deal for NBIS and Microsoft. The initial deal from MSFT is you have 200 MW - 300 MW of power coming online, \"We'll take that right now.\" No questions asked.\n\nWhat if at some milestone i.e. permit checkmark or otherwise Galaxy says we are ready to establish Phase 4, 5, 6, 7 to commit/contract out? That I know is going to occur but the only real question I have is how fast can that unbeknownst to me milestone occur to give an official deal channel from CoreWeave with Galaxy and thus CoreWeave to Hyperscaler?\n\nWell, if you remember, President Trump and the EPA now have an official fast track AI infrastructure plan which is to remove hurdles and obstacles to get AI powered shells up and going as fast as possible. That's net new from just a couple months ago.\n\nThe largest benefit that will shave off 18-30 months of a normal project is letting the landlord build first without have any emissions and working in parrell for the other land and water regulations that have to occur whilst trying to fast track those parts and pieces too.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m7wfsck4fjof1.png?width=750&format=png&auto=webp&s=a33d66c4065dc93933a4174a66d95321146b6ee3\n\n**Current Understanding of New EPA Rules**\n\n* **Executive Order is in force.** EO **14318** \u201cAccelerating Federal Permitting of Data Center Infrastructure\u201d was signed **July 23, 2025** and published in the Federal Register **July 28, 2025**. It directs agencies to use FAST-41, NEPA categorical exclusions, and other shortcuts for large (100 MW+) AI data centers and their power infrastructure. [The White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/07/accelerating-federal-permitting-of-data-center-infrastructure/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n* **EPA has announced rulemaking (proposed).** On **Sept 9, 2025**, EPA said it will revise the \u201c**Begin Actual Construction**\u201d definition under Clean Air Act NSR so **non-emitting work can start before air permits are issued**; formal rule text isn\u2019t final yet. [US EPA](https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-announces-permitting-reform-provide-clarity-expedite-construction-essential-power?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n* **FAST-41 dashboard exists but no AI data centers listed yet.** The Permitting Council\u2019s dashboard shows covered/transparency projects; as of today there\u2019s **no clearly labeled AI data center project** posted. (Categories are public, but specific AI DC entries aren\u2019t there yet.) [Performance.gov Permitting Council](https://www.permits.performance.gov/projects/fast-41-covered?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n\nThe update of you can begin construction now before needing the Clean Air Act NSR air permits are needed to begin non-emitting work. That's massive. I believe this could usher in commitments and deal sign-offs a lot sooner.\n\nYou show the hyperscaler you have a powered shell commit and they are ready to contract up; right way. For these reasons I believe we may get a massive new deal in the range of $22 - $50 Billion dollars to assure that whatever capacity Galaxy and CoreWeave yield is committed to throughout a longer 7 - 10 year capacity commitment.\n\nThis is the only thing that makes sense for what Galaxy is doing. Of course I could be wrong or my timeline could be way off so we shall see.\n\nHere is Helios in 2024\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1xnbc7o6fjof1.png?width=1491&format=png&auto=webp&s=0e0cc8822e2da508d1f6f22ff0731f17439bf719\n\nIf this looks crude and unorganized but effective that's because it is. This is mostly the power Galaxy's Helios had up and running for coin mining operations converted now over for the AI new big oil gold rush.\n\nInterestingly Nvidia (NVDA) has released a new blog post on September 9th 2025 giving reference designs for what Giga-Scale AI Factories should look like and as you see the comparison they are nothing what the current Helios design looks like today.\n\n[NVIDIA Partners With AI Infrastructure Ecosystem to Unveil Reference Design for Giga-Scale AI Factories](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/ai-factories-reference-design/)\n\nAt the AI Infrastructure Summit, NVIDIA\u2019s Ian Buck introduces a reference design and partner-driven strategy to transform global infrastructure for high-performance, energy-efficient AI.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/crm4amz8fjof1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=5a727438a89a019d52ad6e012a73f53ec06da4f2\n\nData center Giga-Scale factories are here and Galaxy has a front row seat to massive income and incoming AI capex. Hyperscalers are paying out huge amounts of cash to anyone and everyone who can procure massive amounts of power. Galaxy is actively doing just this.\n\n**My current positions:** I've opened a small position in GLXY and will be adding more Today!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/loxvr7kbfjof1.png?width=1801&format=png&auto=webp&s=1302fe5d76d95546311fe7b791e1fa3c48842b29\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fyfld7kbfjof1.png?width=1735&format=png&auto=webp&s=1b813ff58b8362500eed18a1f6175fca8218295f\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vq3p08kbfjof1.png?width=1729&format=png&auto=webp&s=cb76ca1a082281873078f596d0e5ac0cfac6e17b\n\n",

    "title": "$CRWV DD - CoreWeave is Low Balling Their Year End Guide by 22%-40% while $NBIS Has their Microsoft Deal Already Max Priced for 2025",
    "selftext": "Contracts are nice but there is a major caveat -- How much can you actually scale to realize those revenues. Now, I am fully disclosing upfront that I expect NBIS to run a lot higher from here. I may be wrong but that's what I expect and that's my bet.\n\nStill, Nebius trades at a premium when it comes to CoreWeave based on core cloud revenues. The price to annual recurring revenue is quite telling.\n\n**Cloud revenue ratio**\n\n* Metric | Q2 CRWV | Q2 NBIS | Ratio\n* Cloud rev | $1.213B | $105.1M | \\~11.5\u201312\u00d7\n\n**Run-rate valuation (apples-to-apples)**\n\n* Company | Market cap (we\u2019re using: CRWV $48B; NBIS $22.9B) | ARR (cloud) | P/ARR\n* CRWV | 48B | \\~$4.85B | \\~9.9\u00d7\n* NBIS | 22.9B | \\~$0.43B | \\~53\u00d7\n\nTo be fair, post IPO lock-up there has been selling by insiders for CoreWeave that have had their share for a very long time. The disparity of the P/ARR is most likely due to that and not the debt financing. Sure people rail on that because they have nothing better to due but I assure you when the selling stops this stock will pop. Selling as of now is a momentum killer for CoreWeave.\n\nWith that being said, there is a reality and to me that reality is grounded by one fact alone. How much MegaWatts of power can you stand-up by end-of-year. Then to normalize that we can take current Q2 known revenues and apply them to what we know as being current standing powered shells or MW's.\n\nIt doesn't matter what the contracts are that are put into the backlog the game here is what can you actually bring online in terms of actively running powered shells. Literally the contracts are written this way. You don't come online-no pay, no delivered throughput of GPU'S - you don't get paid. If it's bad enough you can lose the entire contract.\n\nNow, I am not totally sure what Nebius's current standing powered shell capacity is in terms of MW's but I am estimating somewhere between 40 - 55 current MW's. Remember the NJ Vineland rollout, which Microsoft just contracted to, is for that facility. If someone knows of another one please let me know. As of now, it's phase 1 2025 \\~100 MW and phase 2 2026 \\~100 MW although it is said can expand up to 300-MW and perhaps there will be great motivation for this. After all, Mark Zuckerberg did say he was putting up GPU tent cities.\n\nThe last thing before we get into graphs and figures. You'll begin to question the Microsoft contract for Nebius and how they will actually be able to achieve that without perhaps rolling into capacity handovers to CoreWeave or others just to buy them more time perhaps. Meaning, $17 billion can't possibly be a revenue for Nebius recognized in their quarters for probably 3 years or more.\n\nThis would be the major analyst question on upcoming Nebius calls that I want to hear the answer too. 100,200,300 MW isn't going to bring in more than what you are kind of guiding to on the top end of 2026 at 200 MW \\~$500 - $700 M quarterly revenues by end of 2026. Surely that is not coming anywhere close in 2025. The contract is through 2031 but if they want to realize more of that revenue now then they are going to have to hurry and build and procure power as fast as humanly possible.\n\nAgain, this is a bit of an advantage for CoreWeave because they have so many data centers up and running and so many more coming online even in this year.\n\n**NBIS NJ Vineland rollout and corresponding MSFT contract**\n\n* Phase | Year | MW | Notes\n* Phase 1 | 2025 | \\~100 | contracted\n* Phase 2 | 2026 | \\~100 | contracted\n* Expandable | Future | up to 300 | site design cap\n\n**Baseline inputs of revenue generated per known MW's**\n\n* Company | Q2 cloud rev | Active MW (Q2) | $/MW/qtr\n* CRWV | $1.213B | \\~470 | \\~$2.58M\n* NBIS | $105.1M | \\~40\u201355 (use 50 midpoint) | \\~$2.10M (range \\~$1.91\u20132.63M)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5pcgvchk4cof1.png?width=2616&format=png&auto=webp&s=0ddfce7ea4f21947704c643845420b095a1eb2c7\n\nSo now that we have a normalized Revenue per MW or R / MW now we can analyze our second graph in earnest. For the Year-End-2025 this is where each company would be for their respective MegaWatt online completions.\n\nSimply, CoreWeave is expected / guided to bring online > 900 MW of total power active YE'25 and Nebius is expected to bring on \\~100 MW of total power active YE'25.\n\n**YE\u201925 MW & implied Q4 cloud revenue**\n\n* Company | YE MW target | Low/Mid/High $/MW | Implied Q4 rev\n* (CRWV: >900 MW; NBIS: \\~100 MW)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ddmwt45o4cof1.png?width=2856&format=png&auto=webp&s=969a0198016c211b09af93d70da0a04a7dd3888b\n\nNow what's interesting here is that one has guided to the top and one has low balled to the bottom.\n\nIf you use the $1.91 - $2.63M for Nebius you would assume on 100 MW of year-end power they would be at a Q4 revenue projection of $.19B - $.263B and their corresponding guide is $.225-$.275B per quarter. That is right in line and a little higher even for the maxed out scale of 100 MW by ye'25.\n\nOn the other hand, CoreWeave has a 22%(top)-40%(bottom) upside on their current ranged guide. So if we're tracking that's a massive whisper number that if they meaningfully bring more than 900 MW online we could see some pretty wild beats on the earnings heading into 2026.\n\n* **CoreWeave:** Our implied **Q4 \u2248 $2.32B**/qtr vs. guidance: **Q3 $1.26\u2013$1.30B** and FY\u201925 **$5.15\u2013$5.35B**, which implies **Q4 need \u2248 $1.66\u2013$1.90B**. So our figure is **\\~22\u201340% above** the guidance-implied Q4.\n* **Nebius:** Our implied **Q4 \u2248 $0.19\u2013$0.26B**/qtr vs. YE\u201925 **ARR guidance $0.9\u2013$1.1B** (**\u2248$0.225\u2013$0.275B per quarter**). So our figure is **within or just below** their guided band.\n\nVisually this is what CoreWeave's surprise guides may yield.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9ieydcgq4cof1.png?width=2223&format=png&auto=webp&s=36683ef74b32c8604fe94c57a2a3057eb79a9362\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vgjez2er4cof1.png?width=2104&format=png&auto=webp&s=94f6dbbfc99515a399cf88299f24f6d035dc4c0a\n\nLook at the comparison between both CoreWeave and NBIS in terms of where they are guiding per predicted active powered capabilities by year-end.\n\nTo illustrate the point here are two Q4 predictive sensitivity guides based on increases/decreases in R / MW.\n\nCoreWeave could whisper out to a major upside because they're MW projection for revenue is coming in lowballed. Red is the current guide and black squares are the reasonably expected guide with powered shells coming online.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pztqi2nt4cof1.png?width=2001&format=png&auto=webp&s=c9a9bba8db0c4a99e3b749b21c7c4de473d1b6c1\n\nFor Nebius because they've guided so high you only can see an effective top end of their guide range.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mdnstgcw4cof1.png?width=2001&format=png&auto=webp&s=2aa3212d3e485cd3f396d68d13aca4fb9a2a1a04\n\nWith all that said, and again with the caveat of CoreWeave is post IPO selling. How is the P/ARR not more normalized. At some point they either all go to \\~10 or one raises and the other recedes. The sky is blue and the sun is white; yeah I know.\n\nBUT can CoreWeave not have the luxury of a little more leeway to their P/ARR once the selling stops?\n\nHere is what would happen if you averaged the too P/ARR's based on a stock price of $100 which is close to where they are today. Effectively, if CoreWeave had half of the P/ARR today this would give a multiple of x 3.34 on the stock price while reducing NBIS's share price by 1/3.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ugoj5opy4cof1.png?width=4132&format=png&auto=webp&s=db3f116ec66411ca98debacca0496f03f41dd0d1\n\nThis is as of today what the stock price would be if CoreWeave had even close to what NBIS's P/ARR was. Overtime I expect they both settle into a P/ARR and then a P/E of about 15 - 25 if they are still aggressively growing.\n\nIf you have anything to add or corrections I will update the model forecasting.\n\nThis is not financial advice or advisor. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/clm4jivg7cof1.png?width=1729&format=png&auto=webp&s=cf3e74afc7d2bdc2cfaa3cdfc7ae78dd3b1cc05c\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ng90qboh7cof1.png?width=1735&format=png&auto=webp&s=8f061ece0688d9e6c89bd0b0cd2c2816bb308526\n\n",

    "selftext": "Everyone is talking about NBIS and its new mega contract with MSFT.\n\nMe?  I\u2019m focused on the next NBIS, which is BTBT.\n\nThe thesis is simple.  BTBT is trading at a massive discount to its intrinsic value right now.\n\nHere is the math:\n\nBTBT owns 121,252 ether in its treasury, valued today at ~$525 million.\n\nBTBT also owns a 74% stake in WYFI, an AI Infrastructure/GPU cloud provider that it recently spun off in an IPO.  At $18.95, WYFI market cap is ~$717 million.  BTBT\u2019s 74% stake = $530mm.\n\nSo thats $1.05 Billion in intrinsic value for BTBT when you combine its ether holdings and stake in WYFI.\n\nWhat\u2019s BTBT trading at?  $2.77/share or $890 million in market cap.  This is a 16% discount to its intrinsic value of $1.05 Billion.\n\nMany Wall Street analysts from Needham to Macquarie have price targets on WYFI much higher ($25-$34/share).  Many analysts also have targets on ether that are much higher $10K+.\n\nYou do the math for what this could mean for BTBT.  The upside is legitimately insane.  The market is completely asleep on this massive opportunity but when people wake up, BTBT will absolutely soar.",

SMCI went from 3 million shares short a quarter ago to 95 million shares short now (Fintel). I know finance and this is no longer a problem. SMCI clearly announced they Do Not Need to restate earnings and their auditors found no instances of fraud (given US laws, you don\u2019t casually declare this on an earnings call).\u00a0\n3. Meeting or even slightly beating earnings will squeeze the shorts\u2019 balls blue. OPEN had a short interest of 20.73%, look what happened when it squeezed.\n4. Massive expected INCREASE in AI spend. Ex: Recent Google earnings announced increase to $85 billion. X (Grok) working to launch millions of GPUs and shipping a \u201cpower plant\u201d from Europe to power it. Every AI player (MSFT, META, AMZN, Open AI etc) will do the same increasing spend to the 70-90bill range. TSMC also reported great earnings. Clear sign demand is accelerating not slowing.\n5. International expansion - SMCI won a Major Exclusive $20 billion DataVolt (Saudi Arabia) deal, Ericsson.\n6. Raised 2.3 billion cash and sold 1.79 billion in receivables for expansion. Big-brain move at 0% interest with capped calls. They are currently generating cash and not burning it, which means the money is primarily for planned massive growth and expansion.\n7. BofA Analist Ruplu Bhattacharya, has a $35 price target on SMCI, but had a price target of $1,090 at one point, which is a ridiculous joke. Big funds probably have major short positions and are now caught with their pants down and are using their Analist to beat prices down. They don\u2019t know computers. If SMCI reports spectacular earnings on 8/5/2025, and their tits get squeezed, she\u2019ll be relegated to OnlyFans.",

Over that same time period, chip competitor Intel's ([INTC](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/INTC)) market cap has actually decreased, while Advanced Micro Devices' ([AMD](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMD)) market cap has increased incrementally from $125 billion to $177 billion.Nvidia's rise proved to be at the center of a new technological boom. Combined with Nvidia, the rise in dominance of six other companies \u2014 Apple ([AAPL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL)), Alphabet ([GOOGL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOGL),\u00a0[GOOG](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOG)), Microsoft ([MSFT](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MSFT)), Amazon ([AMZN](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMZN)), Meta ([META](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/META)), and Tesla ([TSLA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA)) \u2014 formed what would come to be known as the\u00a0[\"Magnificent Seven.\"](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/one-chart-shows-how-the-magnificent-7-have-dominated-the-stock-market-in-2023-203250125.html)\n\nThe group began the AI boom with a combined market cap just shy of $7 billion. Now, two and a half years later, the Big Tech group's market cap is worth over $16.8 trillion. The seven companies have grown from about 22% of the S&P 500's market cap in November 2022 to 32% of the index's market cap today.Given the outsized weighting in the S&P 500, large swings in shares of Nvidia have become a feature of how even broad market investors are thinking about the direction of stocks. In June 2024,[\u00a0three Wall Street strategists boosted their year-end S&P 500 targets](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ai-enthusiasm-prompts-3-wall-street-banks-to-raise-stock-market-forecasts-100027154.html), citing better-than-expected consistent performance among key AI players.\n\nAs of May 19, the Magnificent Seven have accounted for about 52% of the S&P 500's gain since Nov. 30, 2022. Nvidia alone has contributed 17.21%, by far the most among the group, with the next closest stock, Microsoft, which has added about 8.8%.Nvidia's stock hasn't been rising from just hype. The company's quarterly financial metrics have soared. In the quarter ChatGPT launched, Nvidia posted revenue of $6.3 billion. Two years later, it would post revenue of $35.3 billion. That's a 460% increase in sales in two years. As seen in the chart below, the main source of growth for Nvidia has been its data center revenue segment, which includes the sales of its AI chips.\n\nFrom the company's fourth quarter of 2023 to its final quarter of its 2025 reporting period, data center revenue grew almost 900%.\n\nNvidia's data center revenue particularly stands out when considering its rise against peers in the industry. In the final quarter of 2024, Nvidia notched a record $35.58 billion in just data center revenue, up from $3.62 billion in the final quarter of 2022.\n\nIn comparison, Alphabet's data center revenue increased to $11.96 billion, ending 2024 up from $7.32 billion in the final quarter of 2022.\n\n\n\n",

    "title": "Everything about AMD's earnings tonight",
    "selftext": "Okay guys, AMD will report its first quarter earnings after the bell on Tuesday. What are we gonna do? See, I'm the concern about the impact of Trump\u2019s tariffs on chip sales and the health of the AI market ahead of Nvidia\u2019s (NVDA) earnings later this month.\n\nFor those who have been paying attention, AMD\u2019s announcement follows rival Intel\u2019s (INTC) report, which saw the company beat on the top and bottom lines but issue lighter-than-anticipated revenue guidance in the second quarter. At the time, Intel CFO David Zinsner blamed the \u201ccurrent macro environment\u201d for creating \u201celevated uncertainty across the industry.\u201d\n\nPC makers produce a number of their products in China, as well as Vietnam and Malaysia. Computers are currently exempt from Trump\u2019s tariffs, but the administration has said it could implement duties on semiconductors based on the results of the Commerce Department\u2019s Section 232 investigation.\n\nFor the quarter, AMD is expected to report adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.94 on revenue of $7.1 billion. The company saw EPS of $0.62 and revenue of $5.4 billion in the same quarter last year. Data Center segment revenue is expected to bring in $3.6 billion in the quarter compared to $2.3 billion last year.\n\nIn April, AMD, like Nvidia, announced that the Trump administration instituted tighter export controls on AI chips destined for China. The move effectively cuts off AMD\u2019s ability to ship its MI308 AI processor to the region, and, according to the company, might result in as much as an $800 million charge on inventory, purchase commitments, and related reserves. And that could weigh on the company\u2019s Q2 outlook.\n\nI expect AMD to post higher results but guide lower given 1Q strength for MI308. Longer term, this might be a good thing in 2Q with the AI chip ban into China.\n\nFor those following AI stocks, you may have noticed them taking a major hit over the past few months on fears that the trade has been overhyped. DeepSeek\u2019s January announcement that it managed to produce high-performance AI models using less than top-of-the-line chips further hammered chip stocks.\n\nShares of AMD are off 18% year to date and 36% over the last 12 months. Nvidia is down 15% year to date, but still up 22% over the last year.\n\nUnfortunately for AMD the AI story (which is already somewhat tenuous) is likely to drop further on the back of new China sanctions. \n\n[Chart](https://i.imgur.com/4PdTT1Q.png)\n\nAI chip companies with to deal with the government's AI diffusion rules, which would require certain countries to acquire special licenses to gain access to a limited number of US AI chips.\n\nAMD\u2019s Client segment, which includes revenue from the sale of laptop and desktop chips, is expected to generate $2 billion in revenue, up from $1.3 billion in Q1 last year. There\u2019s the potential that the company could report that it saw a pull forward in sales leading up to Trump\u2019s April 2 tariff announcements.\n\nFrom what I've read, the core PC business appears to be exposed to channel effects (client shipments last quarter were higher than the peak of the COVID bubble already).\n\nAMD\u2019s gaming business, which includes sales of GPUs and semi-custom chips for video game consoles, is expected to bring in $540 million, a 41% year-over-year decline from the same quarter last year. It's only recently that the Ryzen biz has pivoted from hardcore HPC parts, such as the Instinct MI250-series used in the United States' first exascale supercomputer at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, to parts competitive with Nvidia for lower-precision AI applications. When it launched, the MI300X boasted up to 32 percent higher performance in certain AI workloads compared to Nvidia's then-flagship the H100, along with more than double the memory and significantly greater bandwidth. \n\nSony's (SONY) and Microsoft\u2019s (MSFT) consoles are approaching the second half of their life cycles, which generally means sales slide versus when they initially hit the market. Companies are also raising prices on the systems to contend with tariffs. Sony has increased the price of its PlayStation in Europe, but not in the US. Consoles aren\u2019t exempt from duties like laptops and desktops. As a result, Microsoft announced it is raising the price of its Xbox Series X by $100 to $599. The company also said it\u2019s raising the price of some of its first-party games to $79 from $69.\n\nI usually like to sit out earnings, but am strongly considering puts (a put spread to avoid IV crush).

    "selftext": "[DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/?f=flair_name%3A%22DD%22)\n\nIn their latest earnings call, while they had revenue from research collaborations, both IONQ and RGTI do not have a commercially viable product, nor do they even have a realistic timeline to one. Both claim, maybe 2030...and quantum computers have always been \"5 more years!\"\n\nSome facts - The RGTI CEO is focused on fidelity - improving accuracy a projected 2x this year! To be commercially viable \"like an NVIDIA GPU\" requires 100,000,000 X accuracy gains...\n\nQuantum Advantage is not a given at lower fidelity rates either.\n\nThe commercial TAMS they claim Quantum will help are not limited by compute (drug discovery, networking, crypto, NFTs, AI, etc.)\n\nAnd now we get to the event coming up; NVIDIA's Quantum Day.\n\nThese stocks went into free fall when Jensen and Zuckerberg admitted quantum tech is many decades out from relevance.\n\nJensen then saved them by stating he was going to host quantum day; MSFT the same day announced for companies to be \"quantum ready for 2025!\" in a blog post.\n\nWe have to ask ourselves why? And what is happening at quantum day?\n\nThe WHY behind NVDA and MSFT is simple - right after this hype marketing on quantum, MSFT reported dissapointing cloud sales to enterprise. MSFT cap-ex on NVIDIA GPUS is dependent on these units sales. MSFT offers the ability to play around with these quantum computers on their cloud for research purposes - though they are typically down and worthless but they do consume a TON of compute.\n\nThis not only marked the top of the market because why would MSFT and NVDA need to pump quantum if AI is going HAM? It's an act of desperation by their marketing teams, simple as.\n\nFinally the coup de grace - QUANTUM DAY (RED WEDDING)\n\nWho is the guest on the same level as NVDA? Crowdstrike. Why? Because the only real application for quantum computers long term is encryption breaking...important for security. The only issue here is; Crowdstrike is invested in avoiding that for their customers so they will DEFINITELY outline how they will invalidate this technology.\n\nWhen the market realizes the only potential use for quantum in decades will be invalidated by tech from players like CRWD, its a headshot.\n\nTo add insult to injury, IONQ's CEO who is attending the NVDIA conference has been comparing themselves to 2015 NVIDIA...claiming Jensen is afraid of them...lol\n\nThis CEO is a serial SPACer and midwit.\n\nEnjoy shorting this or buy puts. I think all will work out. Not financial advice. Maybe buy some short term calls to hedge.\n\nShort with April hedges.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xogflhef73oe1.png?width=548&format=png&auto=webp&s=383fd6222262a6237633e591b712a9a6a90975b8\n\n",

    "selftext": "As is usual before NVDA earnings, FUD is being spread about the \u2018AI trade.\u2019 I find this situation again reminiscent of the DeepSeek panic which NVDA and other AI plays quickly rebounded from in about a week (see my previous [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1icdu1d/deepseek_training_cost_the_95_mil_difference/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) highlighting the blatant misunderstanding of renting GPUs for $5.6m vs. total cost of ownership for AI infrastructure in $100s of billions).\n\n**The FUD: \u2018data center oversupply\u2019**\n\nHeadlines have been coming out that Microsoft walking away from a \u201ccouple hundred MWs\u201d of datacenter leases (note, this would likely represent <5% of their overall estimated 5 GW installed capacity). Analysts are also insinuating this means there is a larger \u2018oversupply\u2019 and therefore AI capital expenditures will be slowing down.\n\n[The Register - Microsoft's drawback on datacenter investment may signal AI demand concerns](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=newssearch&cd=&ved=2ahUKEwj8jtzHg9-LAxXol-4BHfCRJ4cQxfQBKAB6BAgPEAE&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theregister.com%2F2025%2F02%2F24%2Fdoes_microsoft_pull_back_on%2F&usg=AOvVaw3nXfbntonLATxN5KnPWAzG&opi=89978449)\n\n*\u201cTD Investment bank claims software giant ditched 'at least' 5 land parcels due to potential 'oversupply'\u201d*\n\n\u00a0\n\n**The Critique: Dip Buying Opp?**\n\nFirst off, it is not clear if these MSFT leases are for high-performance compute (GPUs for AI workloads) or traditional non-AI cloud (for things like storage, where demand has been waning). For the sake of argument, let\u2019s assume this was for AI compute.\n\n**Point 1** \\- Overall, Microsoft is not slowing down. After the TD report on Friday, Microsoft [reiterated they are not cutting their $80bil capital spending plan for this year](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/24/microsoft-reiterates-plan-to-invest-80-billion-in-ai-.html). So, as they are walking away from a couple hundred MWs of leased capacity, meanwhile they will be building several GWs.\n\n**Point 2** \\- In Q4, Microsoft missed cloud revenue targets. On the earnings call, CFO Amy hood noted shortfalls in Q4 performance was due to supply constraints, and the larger capex spend is expected to drive stronger Azure growth. In other words, the revenue miss was a *capacity problem*, not a *demand problem*. So why slow down now? Doesn\u2019t add up.\n\n**Point 3** \u2013 Open AI is adding more compute capacity with other partners (Oracle and Softbank). This would represent a ***shift*** in capital spending from Microsoft to others, i.e. this does not indicate an oversupply.\n\n[Microsoft and OpenAI evolve partnership to drive the next phase of AI - The Official Microsoft Blog](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2025/01/21/microsoft-and-openai-evolve-partnership-to-drive-the-next-phase-of-ai/)\n\n\u201cMicrosoft has **approved OpenAI\u2019s ability to build additional capacity**, primarily for research and training of models.\u201d\n\n[OpenAI Stargate Joint Venture Demystified | Microsoft Sore Loser, Does Softbank Have The Capital?, Texas GigaCampus, Winners & Losers \u2013 SemiAnalysis](https://semianalysis.com/2025/01/23/openai-stargate-joint-venture-demystified/#microsoft-is-the-biggest-loser)\n\n\u201c**Microsoft is largely left on the sidelines as OpenAI utilizes another infrastructure partner.** As Satya Nadella\u00a0[stated](https://x.com/ns123abc/status/1882085592135237737?s=19), \u201call I know is, I\u2019m good for my $80B.\u201d Microsoft\u2019s recent\u00a0[blog post](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2025/01/21/microsoft-and-openai-evolve-partnership-to-drive-the-next-phase-of-ai/)\u00a0stated the facts of the partnership and how Microsoft has a ROFR, but the reality is this is\u00a0incrementally negative for\u00a0Microsoft long-term since they were **afraid to take on the risk of this investment.**\u00a0\u201c\n\n\u201c**Microsoft is shifting some of the capital intensity of its AI initiatives on to Oracle**, but we don\u2019t think this short-term benefit outweighs the long-run potential harm of losing the revenue and control over OpenAI.\u201d\n\n**AI continues advancements:**\n\nAnthropic\u2019s [Claude 3.7](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/anthropics-claude-3-7-sonnet-the-first-hybrid-reasoning-model-is-now-available-in-amazon-bedrock/) was released Monday and is quickly approaching professional human-level coding abilities (70% on SWE bench, which measures agentic coding ability vs. 80% avg. score for a human professional). Open AI\u2019s ChatGPT 4.5 is rumored to be released in the coming weeks as well. These are/will be tangible results in the advancement of these models towards agentic use with addressable markets in the trillions (think remote \u2018drop-in\u2019 AI coworker). Further, continued investment in U.S. AI infrastructure will be of paramount importance to national security (maintaining AI supremacy over China). \u00a0\n\n**TLDR:** I see this as a dip buying opportunity on AI names & energy. Overreaction from MSFT news. (NVDA, TSM, VRT\\*\\*, AVGO, MRVL, ANET, CIEN, NBIS, APLD, VST, OKLO, ET, KMI)\n\n\\*\\*See UBS 11:27 AM ET, 02/25/2025 note on Vertiv: \u201cOur conclusion is the recent sell-off is way overdone, as it implies >30% reduction in data center capacity growth vs. what was priced in just 30 days ago.\"\n\n  \nDisclaimer: Not financial advice, blah, blah, blah.  I'm probably just a delusional perma-bull.",

As the holiday season approaches, technology procurement leaders at major enterprises are busy prioritizing their technology spending plans for 2025. These budget adjustments could signal potential changes in market share and spending direction.\n\n\n\nWhile OpenAI and Microsoft are getting a lot of attention in the AI space, a new CIO (chief information officer) survey shows that Alphabet (GOOGL.O) is rapidly coming into its own in the enterprise AI spending race.\n\n\n\nPiper Sandler's 2025 CIO Survey, which was released over the weekend, interviewed 81 CIOs about their budget priorities for different vendors and technology areas.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe tech industry will be dynamic in 2025,\u201d Piper Sandler's analyst team writes, \u201dwith generative AI transitioning from the testing/planning phase to implementation and driving growth in cloud spending.\u201d\n\n\n\nAnalysts noted that 87 percent of CIOs expect their IT budgets to increase in 2025, the highest percentage since the survey began in 2020.\n\n\n\nThe popularity of Google Cloud increased significantly compared to the previous two surveys. In the \u201cmost strategic\u201d AI vendor category, Google Cloud received 27 percent support, up from 15 percent six months ago. Meanwhile, Microsoft, the former leader, saw its support drop from 33% to 24%.\n\n\n\nGoogle Cloud also topped the ranking of AI infrastructure providers. When asked which cloud company they plan to test or implement AI projects with next year, 50 percent of respondents chose Google Cloud.\n\n\n\nOverall, this is good news for the major cloud infrastructure providers.The uptick in interest in AI applications and projects has led to higher spending intentions than six months ago for all providers, including Microsoft Azure, Amazon AWS, Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI).\n\n\n\nThe trend has been equally favorable to the parent companies of these cloud companies - Microsoft, Amazon (AMZN.O), Alphabet and Oracle (ORCL.N).\n\n\n\nIt's also a big plus for NVIDIA (NVDA.O), according to Harsh Kumar, a semiconductor analyst at Piper.\n\n\n\nAll cloud companies are big customers of NVIDIA's AI chips. NVIDIA holds more than 70 percent of the AI GPU (graphics processing unit) market, according to analysts.Kumar expects the AI chip market to exceed $500 billion by 2028.\n\n\n\nIf CIOs' budget plans come to fruition, 2025 will be a major growth year for AI. Investors are already picking up on the trend, with Alphabet's shares having risen nearly 15 percent this month.\n\nPersonally, I think the short-term risk is high and the better strategy in the long run is to buy low\n\n",

Google owns 90%+ of search traffic (when did you ever hear \u201cyahoo it\u201d or \u201cask duck duck go\u201d?) and monetizes it like a legal cartel.

    "selftext": "Let's face it, $SNOW has been one of the most disappointing-performing stocks of the year. While $NVDA is riding the AI wave, and $MSTR is riding the BTC boom, $SNOW has been sitting here like a fat child eating cake and shitting himself in the process.\n\nBut this is all about to change, and let's discuss why:\n\n1. Winter is coming, and people will associate $SNOW with warm fuzzy feelings while drinking hot cocoa by the fireplace. This is inherently bullish.\n2. $SNOW has historically always beaten revenue estimates (bullish), and 88% of the time it beats EPS estimates. I expect this time to be no different (beat both revenue and EPS), however this is never enough to rally this stock (more below).\n3. $SNOW has been hiring like crazy. I know because I've applied twice so far and been rejected both times (smart choice on their part - bullish), which means they're being picky and likely receiving a lot of strong candidates to improve their offering (extra bullish). I've been keeping an eye on all open positions, along with how long they're open for, and new ones that pop up. Everything I've seen indicates a hiring frenzy to expand into more markets, take on new clients, etc.\n4. $SNOW tends to retain their customers and strengthen existing relationships. Just today they announced a stronger partnership with $MSFT by releasing a new platform to work with $MSFT Power Platform (bullish AF)\n5. In May, $SNOW appointed Sridhar Ramaswamy as the new CEO, who is expected to focus on enhancing the company's AI (bullish) product strategy.\n6. Going off the point above, the actual real-world numbers of customers using their AI product is genuinely exploding, and we all know how bullish AI is in today's market. \n\n**Q**: Ok, but why is THIS time different than all the other earnings reports when $SNOW crashed and burned?\n\n**A**: Like I said in Point 2 above, we Snowflakians always beat revenue and EPS predictions, but for some reason the stock always goes down. The reason behind this - as is the consensus of analysts - is that investors are cautious against how much money $SNOW is pouring into their products, R&D, and operating costs. This quarter we should start to actually see the results of these investments, returning strong usage statistics and a healthy increase in overall adoption from the industry.\n\n**Q**: Ok, but what about, like, Databricks and stuff?\n\n**A**: Databricks can suck my nuts (they also haven't hired me yet - I'm trying to get in before they go public for those sweet stock gainz)\n\n**My Positions** (Screenshot below):\n\n200 Shares $SNOW @ $127.95\n\n10x 128C Exp 12/06/24 @ $8.36\n\n5x 160C Exp 06/20/25 @ $10.47\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t40qeg1d5x1e1.jpg?width=1226&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=983664d9a5f3edd36636d54711c56d8d63a75620\n\nThis is not financial advice.

    "title": "$BABA - The Azure of Asia-Pacific: Cloud Growth Could Send This Rocket to the Moon\u00a0\ud83d\ude80",
    "selftext": "TL;DR\n\nAlibaba ($BABA) is more than just an e-commerce behemoth; its cloud computing division, Alibaba Cloud, is leading the charge in Asia\u2019s explosive cloud growth. With Asia\u2019s cloud market expected to grow at a CAGR of 17.4% by 2028, this sleeping dragon might be your ticket to big gains. Let me break it down.\n\n\n\n1.\u00a0**Alibaba Cloud: The Azure of Asia-Pacific**\n\nIf Amazon has AWS and Microsoft has Azure, then Asia has Alibaba Cloud. It\u2019s already the #1 cloud provider in Asia-Pacific, with close to 40% market share. The division isn\u2019t just following Western models\u2014it\u2019s adapting to local markets and dominating. Countries like China, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand are leveraging Alibaba Cloud as their backbone for digital transformation. **A key differentiator is that unlike Amazon and Microsoft, Alibaba has proprietary GenAI in QWEN that rivals OpenAIs GPT offerings.**\n\nRecent milestones:\n\n\u2022 +7% YoY growth in cloud revenue last quarter, and triple-digit growth in AI\n\n\u2022 Launched Tongyi Qianwen, their ChatGPT competitor, tailored for enterprise solutions, giving them an AI edge. QWEN is ahead of GPT/OpenAI in several categories ([https://venturebeat.com/ai/alibaba-claims-no-1-spot-in-ai-math-models-with-qwen2-math/](https://venturebeat.com/ai/alibaba-claims-no-1-spot-in-ai-math-models-with-qwen2-math/))\u00a0 ([https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/25/technology/china-open-source-ai.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/25/technology/china-open-source-ai.html))\n\n\u2022 Collaboration with ByteDance, NIO, and other Asian giants.\n\nBy aligning with governments and enterprises,\u00a0**Alibaba Cloud is becoming indispensable in Asia\u2019s growing digital economy.**\n\n\n\n2.\u00a0**Asia\u2019s Cloud Market Is on Fire \ud83d\udd25**\n\nAsia-Pacific\u2019s cloud market is expected to grow from $120 billion in 2023 to $264 billion by 2028 (CAGR: 17.4%; this is greater than the US market at \\~12%). Alibaba\u2019s dominance in the region positions it to capture a lion\u2019s share of this pie. Here\u2019s why this is huge:\n\n\u2022 Cloud penetration is still low in Asia compared to the West. With increasing internet adoption, 5G expansion, and government incentives, the growth runway is long.\n\n\u2022 Alibaba\u2019s infrastructure covers 28 global regions and 90+ availability zones, but its home-field advantage in Asia gives it an edge Western competitors can\u2019t match.\n\n\n\n3.\u00a0**The Cloud Is Becoming Alibaba\u2019s Profit Engine**\n\nE-commerce might have built Alibaba, but cloud computing will carry it into the future. This is exactly what happened with Amazon and AWS. Let\u2019s connect the dots:\n\n\u2022\u00a0AWS accounts for 70%+ of Amazon\u2019s operating income.\n\nAlibaba Cloud isn\u2019t there yet, but it\u2019s trending in the same direction. Margins are improving as it scales, and with increased AI adoption, demand for compute resources will only grow.\n\n\u2022\u00a0China\u2019s e-commerce regulation hit BABA hard, but cloud revenue is regulation-light and critical for economic growth. The Chinese government even promotes Alibaba\u2019s cloud adoption for its national digital strategy and helps develop new contracts abroad ([https://www.asiafinancial.com/china-indonesia-sign-10bn-in-deals-on-evs-batteries-solar](https://www.asiafinancial.com/china-indonesia-sign-10bn-in-deals-on-evs-batteries-solar)).\n\n\n\n4.\u00a0**Dirt Cheap Valuation Compared to Western Cloud Giants**\n\nBABA is severely undervalued compared to its US counterparts. Look at this:\n\n|Metric|Alibaba ($BABA)|Microsoft ($MSFT)|Amazon ($AMZN)|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|P/E|10x|34x|62x|\n|Cloud Revenue CAGR|\\~30% in Asia|\\~20% globally|\\~25% globally|\n\nWhy? China FUD. But if you believe in the secular growth trend of cloud computing in Asia, this valuation gap screams opportunity. Also, aside from Asia, Alibaba is constructing a new data center in Mexico ([https://www.theregister.com/2024/05/24/alibaba\\_cloud\\_mexico\\_asia\\_expansion/](https://www.theregister.com/2024/05/24/alibaba_cloud_mexico_asia_expansion/))\n\n\n\n5.\u00a0**The Macro Tailwinds Are Strong**\n\nLet\u2019s not ignore the China reopening play and China\u2019s commitment to stimulate the economy. Add in Beijing\u2019s recent pro-business rhetoric, and $BABA could see significant upside. Plus:\n\n\u2022\u00a0Alibaba\u2019s $25 billion buyback program means it\u2019s returning value to shareholders at an aggressive pace.\n\n\u2022\u00a0Spin-offs on the horizon: The cloud division could IPO in the future, unlocking massive shareholder value. Think AWS spin-off rumors but real. Let\u2019s not forget that ANT \ud83d\udc1c is back!! ([https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jack-ma-backed-ant-profit-121522222.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jack-ma-backed-ant-profit-121522222.html)); ([https://www.scmp.com/tech/big-tech/article/3286177/ant-backed-credit-rating-firm-gets-central-bank-approval-china-after-3-year-wait](https://www.scmp.com/tech/big-tech/article/3286177/ant-backed-credit-rating-firm-gets-central-bank-approval-china-after-3-year-wait))\n\n\n\n6.\u00a0**Price Targets and Risks**\n\n\u2022\u00a0Base case: $150 in 12 months (30% upside).\n\n\u2022\u00a0Bull case: $200+ if cloud growth accelerates (70%+ upside).\n\n\u2022\u00a0Bear case: Regulatory crackdowns re-emerge, though unlikely given current trends. \n\n\n\n**Final Thoughts:**\n\nAlibaba is a rare mix of value and growth with a transformative cloud business that\u2019s only scratching the surface of its potential. The Asian cloud market is exploding, and BABA\u2019s position as the \u201cAzure of Asia\u201d gives it an unbeatable edge. Don\u2019t sleep on this one\u2014when the market realizes the true potential of Alibaba Cloud, $BABA will soar.\n\nOne more thing, it\u2019s chairman Joe Tsai is on a winning-streak. He invested $150M of his family fund into more shares of $BABA, and let\u2019s not forget that the NY Liberty just won the WNBA title. The Brooklyn Nets aren\u2019t there yet, but that doesn\u2019t change that Joe Tsai is one very smart China bull! His strategic vision as chairman is up there with the top CEOs we look-up to today ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8znIj2ML\\_Vo&t=11s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8znIj2ML_Vo&t=11s))\n\n\n\n**P.S. for Key Concerns:**\n\n1. Many of you Apes \ud83e\udd8d fear Chinese investments because of regulatory concerns and the Republic overstepping. We saw what happened after Jack Ma criticized the financial infrastructure and compared it to a pawn shop. Over the years, China realized that they would benefit from leveraging Alibaba\u2019s technology and have shifted their tone and relationship. Here is a recent article from Summer 2024 in China shared that Alibaba is in harmony with the republic ([https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Companies/Alibaba-s-3-year-antitrust-rectification-is-over-Beijing-says](https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Companies/Alibaba-s-3-year-antitrust-rectification-is-over-Beijing-says))\n\n1. Another key China concern since the election are US tariffs moving to 60%. Aside from this being a negotiation tactic that will likely not come to fruition, international e-Commerce is growing for Alibaba and it is not attributed to the US (\\~9% of Alibaba\u2019s international ecommerce is attributed to the US). With news of the Chinese megaport in Peru, South America is going to become a huge importer of Chinese goods TAX-FREE [https://www.wsj.com/world/china-xi-jinping-latin-america-acf6dbc1](https://www.wsj.com/world/china-xi-jinping-latin-america-acf6dbc1)\n\n\n\n  \n**Positions:**\n\nAfter earnings on Friday, I loaded 420 shares of $BABA and 120 $100 calls for 12/6. Across all accounts, I have about 700 shares and am considering leaps into late 2025.",

    "title": "Stocks that are going to go nuclear, no, literally.",
    "selftext": "You have seen in recent news that lots of data centers and AI fueled companies are looking for sustainable carbon free energy. That still isn't enough for the likes of amzn, and msft. They need sustainable STABLE energy. Nuclear is the only real option to hit this. Wind and solar energy are not feasible and if we are honest to ourselves, they simply aren't efficient enough. This is why nuclear is needed. \n\nMany disasters have occured: chernobyl, three mile island, and fukushima to name a few. This has caused the public to have a negative outlook on the technology. Many people believe wrongly that these reactors will destroy the world, when in fact post construction they are some of the safest forms of energy production.\n\nThe issue in the past with traditional reactors are that these projects are super fund sites. BILLIONS of dollars, government regulations bloat the cost and balloon the build time. In order to get a new design, the government is the only source. A lengthy billion+ dollar gamble so most build off the last approved design making small improvements. \n\nEnter SMR's , small modular nuclear reactors. They are extremely small sites in comparison to traditional monstrosities. The safety zone surrounding a SMR set up is limited to the bounds of the actual generator site. This is a big deal because with traditional reactors you have to build out a secured zone 10+ miles around the actual sites perimeter. The costs continuously add up for traditional economies. \n\nWho is designing SMRS? Tons of people are attempting but it no longer matters. As of 2020, the company NuScale is the only company in the united states with an approved reactor design. Other companies attempting to design and theorize have already gained support from the private industry in most recent history Amazon did so. They are giving money to start ups who are 10+ YEARS behind NuScale in hopes of getting in early.\n\n  \nNuScale has lost money year over year but have done amazing at cutting down on costs and bloat reducing their year over year expenses drastically. They have received government assistance already in 2014 (https://www.energy.gov/ne/articles/doe-approves-award-carbon-free-power-project), to the tune of 1.4b USD from the DOE which means government relations have already been built. \n\nThey went to deploy and test the reactors by building a 12 module reactor but fear of extra costs and hitting deadlines drove off private investors causing a halt on the project. AND YET NuScale performed relatively well in sustaining its value for a startup that's never made money. They continue to strive for a mid 2025 start to selling and commercializing their product to prove to the world it is safe and possible. I don't really think I need to explain in depth how AI data super centers, mass surveillance, quantum computing, and the general virtualization of everything will continue to drive the demand for stable sustainable energy and how that relates to NuScale.\n\n  \nYou may ask the following: \"How is this a small risk investment if you're claiming such higher performance?\", \"How are you sure we are going to go nuclear? The coming administration in the US wont be favorable to renewables!\", \"How do you think even if we are it will happen on a short time span?\"\n\n  \nI have answers. \n\n  \nEven if NuScale goes tits up in debt, has no way of securing contracts, gets beat out my competitors (impossible lol), IT STILL HAS ITS APPROVED DESIGN. That is their (for lack of a better term) trump card. It is worth the 24$ alone depending on who scoops them up to finish the mission. This leads me into the second nuclear stock. To supply this industry uranium will be needed. The government has been looking for a domestic supplier of fuel grade uranium that is ready for enrichment. Sadly, the enrichment game is mostly private holdings can't get in on that public goodness. But Uranium Energy Corp. has been making money moves, aquiring LIQUIDATABLE uranium and hodling it as hard as they can. Increasing mining, storage, and infrastructure capacities. They are ready for the next move. The united states is already trying to bid on BOTH A GenIII+ nuclear reactor(https://www.energy.gov/oced/generation-iii-small-modular-reactor-program), as well as a domestic supplier and enricher of fuel grade uranium(https://www.energy.gov/articles/biden-harris-administration-announces-four-contracts-boost-domestic-haleu-supply-and) <-- they have one for Low enriched as well.\n\nThe government is cheap and wants to save money. They have made a report investigating the savings made per killowat compared to the incentives given. They found they gave out 50+ billions and made jack shit return. They equated to do the same garbage return rate they'd only have to use 10 billion for the SMR tech coming out if they support the role out. \n\nEven with trump in office these stocks make sense to invest in for both hodling potential and short term options gamba. The government is already in favor of this, they will do whatever they need to change the public perception Hell, they don't even care., They will executive order whatever they need.  The following are reasons a trump office will help nuclear.\n\nHe has already stated that he will slash 4 or however many regulations per passed regulation. This will benefit all industries regardless of how you feel about it on an emotional level. Furthermore he wants a stronger American offense and defense. Putting SMRs into most states after commercial shows its viability will make for an invasion insurance, solar flare insurance, EMP insurance, supernova insurance, etc. SMRs are off grid capable. They can provide direct power hence the stability for data centers. If the grid goes down SMR's keep pumping. The steam they produce in the next generation will be more efficiently harvested for chemical manufacturing of ammonia and other reagents.\n\nEven with a strong want to continue using fossil fuels for trump, all the fossil fuel industries benefit. With the minimal space requirements needed essentially anywhere near any industry center a nuclear reactor could be built. And on the same page, lets talk about the building of this reactor(s) and its module(s).\n\n  \nIt is a modular system and NuScale has already put thought and money into fabrication plants to create the modular components, as well as invested in what they call E2 centers across the globe to train professionals to work at NuScale reactor sites. They aren't a tech bullshit startup with false promises they are actively confident and preparing for a 3 year explosion into the industry. They have made talks and contracts and centers in eastern europe namely romania, they have done the same in the middle east, they have done the same in africa specifically full blown university support from Ghana(https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/ghana-signs-agreement-build-small-nuscale-nuclear-reactor-2024-08-29/). This shit is happening but retail regards still have their head in the sand. I think the big boys are waiting to blow this shit up over night in the coming few years.\n\n  \nI bought in at 22 something and it hit almost 26 the other day. UEC is a bit more volatile but in the exact same boat. This isnt a source of uncorrelated returns, these markets are both going online. And if tariffs happen, these people are MOONING. The signs are right in our faces.\n\nFINAL KEY POINTS AND WRAP UP FOR THE TLDREGARDS:\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Nuclear energy is happening short term and already has DOE support.\n\n\\*\\*\\*ONLY ENTITY THAT HAS AN APPROVED SMR DESIGN BY THE NUKE COMITEE IN THE US\\*\\*\\*\n\n\\*\\*TRUMP SLASHING REGS ++ TARIFFS??\\*\\*\n\n\\*\\*UEC MEETS DOE FUTURE GOALS AS DOMESTIC URANIUM SUPPLY\\*\n\n\\*US ALLIES URANIUM SUPPLIES FACE UNCERTAINTIES WHICH MEANS $$$$ FOR US SALES\\*\\*\n\n\\*\\*MINIMAL RISK LONG TERM AS THEY BOTH HAVE AN EXTREMELY VALUABLE INTRINSIC ASSET REPSECITVELY\\*\\*\n\n\\*\\*EVERYTHING IS ON SCHEDULE ACCORDING TO NUSCALE SMR Q3 REPORT\\*\\*\\*\n\n  \nSOURCES::\n\n  \n[https://www.energy.gov/ne/articles/doe-approves-award-carbon-free-power-project](https://www.energy.gov/ne/articles/doe-approves-award-carbon-free-power-project)\n\nhttps://www.energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2018/11/f57/Examination%20of%20Federal%20Financial%20Assistance%20in%20the%20Renewable%20Energy%20Mark...\\_1.pdf\n\n[https://www.energy.gov/oced/generation-iii-small-modular-reactor-program](https://www.energy.gov/oced/generation-iii-small-modular-reactor-program)\n\n[https://www.energy.gov/articles/biden-harris-administration-announces-four-contracts-boost-domestic-haleu-supply-and](https://www.energy.gov/articles/biden-harris-administration-announces-four-contracts-boost-domestic-haleu-supply-and)\n\n[https://www.nuscalepower.com/en/news/press-releases/2024/nuscale-power-reports-third-quarter-2024-results](https://www.nuscalepower.com/en/news/press-releases/2024/nuscale-power-reports-third-quarter-2024-results)\n\n[https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/ghana-signs-agreement-build-small-nuscale-nuclear-reactor-2024-08-29/](https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/ghana-signs-agreement-build-small-nuscale-nuclear-reactor-2024-08-29/)\n\n",

    "title": "MSFT Pre-Earnings Analysis: AI Arms Race and Channel Check - AI Number May Show Double Digit Growth in Q1 2025 - Monster Quarter Growth",
    "selftext": "This might be one of Microsoft's most influential quarters in quite some time. The main argument for my thesis is OpenAI and recent AI model upgrades from in the form of GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, GPT-o1, and GPT-o1-mini. As well, I don't know if anyone noticed their Uranium portfolio's going through the roof but if not check out SMR, OKLO and others to see more. AI needs so much power that they are opening up defunct nuclear power plants on 3-mile island in Pennsylvania for new energy sources.\n\nWhat most media types don't have a window into, mostly I assume this because they keep saying the same silly thing over and over again, is that enterprise is using AI. AI is not going to come in the form of a \"killer app\". The killer app is ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, Mistral. Those are the killer apps but those are also not important things in the AI arms race. AI in and of in itself is the killer app. The reason for this is that it commoditized intelligence in the form of tokens that can be literally bought and sold through the cloud.\n\nWhen certain media types keep railing on the notion that \"who's making money with this\" they are missing the reality in that people are making money with this each and every day. The enterprise is creating applications that are simply not understood by everyday people or analysts because there not the \"killer apps\" that people think of which represents mostly something popular that teenagers and young adults are into. Is Venmo a killer app? Is Facebook a killer apps still? I don't know maybe I'm just not with the times. What i do know is that is that AI is so large and so democratized that the use cases, while not killer, are becoming increasingly ubiquitous in the enterprise setting.\n\nThis is the fast and steady drum beat of GAI increasingly taking over all human cognitive tasks.  It won't happen overnight but it is happening. I think what is happening with the media is that they can't put a metric to it so I will attempt to.\n\nAI adoption and penetration into everyday processes and tasks for enterprise is probably at 0.6%-1%. If you include the backlog of potential AI penetration it is probably 2 - 5% of all enterprise tasks and processes. The immediate 1 - 2 year outlook of AI penetration is probably 1 - 3% with a backlog of 6-9%. To be clear, I am not considering productivity gains because who the hell cares about any of that.  I am specifically speaking about cold hard ROI of implementing an AI automation system and having that AI do the work that was once a human task now offloading to an AI automation task.\n\nI don't know how you feel about the above numbers but in my interpretation it is incredibly slow but growth can be incredibly exponential in relatively a short amount of time. The reason, I've written about this many times before, is because the data is not ready, the talent is not there to reconstruct and rebuild what needs to be in place to make efficient data process that are specific to AI, and many many other factors.\n\nThis is why consulting through the likes of Accenture, Palantir, IBM and others will be very important in the coming years. It's my opinion that companies now matter how large or small won't be able to put in the right processes without proven practices that will foster from consultancy groups rather than at home grown talent. However, there will be clues of how well the progress is going. An AI channel check if you will.\n\n**AI Channel Check through Microsoft Azure:**\n\nMicrosoft provides this channel check for us. Alphabet just completed their channel check and the news on AI was good. Continued spending for all things AI and healthy numbers in their core businesses to justify the continued spend. I look for Microsoft to report much in the same way in terms of AI CapEx/Spend.\n\n2 quarters ago Microsoft started reporting the AI portion of their Azure Cloud revenues. 2 quarters ago it was 6%, and the previous quarter it rose to 7%. For their earnings report tomorrow the AI revenue should be in the 10-12% range. In my opinion 8% is not going to cut it. 1% quarterly gain seems slow. The number in aggregate should be 2%+ quarter to quarter growth. In this way, 1% isn't going to cut it for Wall Street. Perhaps we do see 8%-9% next quarter and that wouldn't be a horrible thing but if Microsoft wants to blow the doors off of earnings and reestablish a healthy growth pattern it is of my opinion that number of percent AI revenue shares needs a meaningful bps up.\n\nI believe that in this earnings there will be that meaningful click upwards of AI percentage growth for Microsoft in the 10%+ range. 11% would be a bust out surprise and 12% would be significantly positive. So where is this possible 3% rise in AI revenue growth coming from? Look no further than GPT-4o.\n\n**GPT-4o and the AI Number**\n\nGpt-4o was initially released on May 13, 2024. For reference, Microsoft's last quarter was, Q4 2024, ended on June 30, 2024, with earnings reported on July 30, 2024. **AI number 7%**. There was no way for GPT-4o to significantly penetrate into their earnings with only roughly 30 days of usage. If you take into account the iterations of 4o itself the model initially was met with skepticism (compared to GPT-4-Turbo) and apprehension until subsequent versions of 4o were released. All-in-all, there is no way GPT-4o was going to be in the previous quarters (Q4) earnings report.\n\nHowever, what's even more interesting is the increase in quota and throughput of GPT-4 to GPT-4o. This is where I believe the AI number from Microsoft will materially increase. Let's take a look.\n\nFirst, let's start with **GPT-4-Turbo** which was released November 6, 2023.\n\n**Git Commit** [e477326](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-ai-docs/blob/e4773268e4e732aefff0f4e3e448568dd4ed998a/articles/ai-services/openai/concepts/models.md):\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dxrpcow7nsxd1.png?width=1447&format=png&auto=webp&s=f549e4934fca8eea2c699aac19bf3792539297f9\n\nCommit **e477326** was dated to Nov 22, 2023. A preview was available, 1106, as of Nov 17, 2023. Using this as a ground truth you can see that the token limit is 134k per minute with a max of 2.7 K requests per minute. this and surely prior to this was hell on enterprises to do any meaningful work with the models. It was great for experimenting and getting started but not for meaningful production work.\n\n**GPT-4o** was released on May 13, 2024.\n\n**Git Commit** [431bb24](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-ai-docs/blob/431bb24aadae464afbeb46a522cf613dc9418025/articles/ai-services/openai/quotas-limits.md):\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wyyz8h6sosxd1.png?width=1020&format=png&auto=webp&s=d91756d0d138410a1bbc5e007bccb147828aac74\n\nCommit **431bb24** was dated to May 20, 2024. As you can see from previous GPT-4 capacity limitations GPT-4o introduced a massive improvement for quota limit TPM and requests per minute RPM. This is a significant release for enterprise customers as they can now begin to plan, develop, and execute AI software stacks into production environments. 60 K RPM's is a 22X upgrade towards production throughput.\n\n**Git Commit** [30084ae](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-ai-docs/blob/30084aee1f0f82335490af8b4b7bd8912cc02af0/articles/ai-services/openai/quotas-limits.md):\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0wa2vvvarsxd1.png?width=1026&format=png&auto=webp&s=c2126f42a5a765364f75e5eace23c250d2e6fb7c\n\nCommit **30084ae** was dated July 24, 2024. In this update the quota TPM was raised from 10M to 30M tokens per minute.\n\n[**Current Quota Limits**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/quotas-limits):\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/l2ah831essxd1.png?width=1153&format=png&auto=webp&s=6f59ee5eb421e81d5eb40afb16147f11b3b0c293\n\nIn the current quota limits there is a 180 K RPM increase from 60 K. At this point and earlier in the quarter OpenAI's GPT-4o models became capacity unlocked. There is nothing you cannot do or plan for in terms of AI model integrations, TPM's, or RPM throughput. At this moment, intelligence is untethered from any api constraints. What you can imagine building in terms of AI and LLMs and the delivery of those products and services can be fully realized without constraint.\n\nIf you go from the beginning analysis of GPT-4-Turbo until today there is a **223X tokens per minute (TPM) increase and a 66.66X request per minute (RPM) increase.**\n\nThis is a massive throughput gain that cannot be expressed enough of how significant this is in terms of AI advancements regarding enterprise adoption.\n\nThis is why I believe the AI Number finally breaks the double digits in this quarter of 10%+. Ever since the last quarter ended, June 30, 2024, there has been a steady stream of AI model improvements and api throughput improvements that are significant in scope. If you couple this with Google's continued AI spend and quality quarter, AI hardware channel checks that verify the AI hardware spend, and a github repo commit history that shows nothing but blazing improvements for Microsoft Azure intelligence; It could not be more clear to me that Microsoft is executing on all levels and should deliver a potentially monster quarter.\n\nNot that it needs it but here is the plug for NVDA as well. All of those github commits and throughput improvements are directly related to Microsoft bringing data centers online all over the world.\n\nThis is insane! I don't have to tell you the git commits for this graph are absolutely bonkers too.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n01g254dvsxd1.png?width=2358&format=png&auto=webp&s=1db8cf408db9ca4c4b02a247f644190f21211587\n\nI have shares in MSFT, NVDA, ARM, VRT, and 1 share of SMCI.

Now I'm seeing the same thing with Crocs. People don\u2019t care that they look like shit anymore; they think it's fashion now. You know those charms you put in the holes of Crocs? Every kid wants them these days. They don\u2019t realize you can get the exact same charms from China for 5% of the price. That\u2019s what I did, and I\u2019ve been rocking the same Crocs for 6 years now. Those crocodiles know how to make shoes man...... Also McDonalds put mini Crocs toys in their happy meals.

    "title": "UWMC DD and Unusual Options Activity",
    "selftext": "Alright, here's the lowdown on UWMC, a wholesale mortgage giant and one of America's largest with an 8% or so market share, which makes them a huge player in the wholesale mortgage game. They\u2019re basically the middleman, partnering with brokers rather than going directly to customers. They\u2019re fast and handle a crazy volume of loans. Their bread and butter is refinancing and new home loans, so the company\u2019s health ties closely to what\u2019s happening with interest rates and the housing market. They repackage said loans into MBS products and sell them to Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae which took on 93% of their loans last year. Usually they have a minimum 30 day holding period, and then these mortgages are off their books for good. UWMC\u2019s last earnings were solid. They reported a\u00a017% revenue increase YoY. Keep in mind this is with interest rates being higher in Q2 this year than they were in Q2 last year. Their price per book ratio is around 6 and their price per cash flow ratio is 28, down from a whopping 185 a year ago. This steep drop means UWMC\u2019s getting its cash flow game together, which makes it more attractive if they keep cash flowing like this. Rates will continue to cut, revenue continues to explode, it becomes a really good interest rate play, especially if Daddy JPow keeps lowering rates. I think this makes a fantastic stock play if you're looking for at least medium term growth, especially since it's trading at under 7 dollars, makes it a value play.\n\nTop institutions are continuing to buy this stock as well, just take a look at some of these listings.\u00a0\n\n* Citadel Advisors: 10.18 Million Shares\n* Vanguard Group: 8.61 Million Shares\n* Fidelity: 8.20 Million Shares\n* Platinum Equity: 4.50 Million Shares\n* BlackRock: 4.82 Million Shares\n* Northern Trust: 4.35 Million Shares\n* Renaissance Technologies: 1.71 Million Shares\n\nI\u2019m usually not one to think about who owns the company, but if Citadel owns about 1/7^(th)\u00a0of the shares of your company\u2019s open float in non-fund shares, it must mean they really fucking like you. But that\u2019s not the main reason why I\u2019m bringing this up. The total float is about 95 million shares, and 26 million of those shares are closely held. 26 million in closely held shares and 65 million in fund ownership really leave roughly 3-5 million shares left available for purchase. Hold on to this thought, I\u2019ll come back to this later.\u00a0\n\nDuring looking this over, I also took a look at their job listings. Everything looked normal\u00a0 until I came across this\u00a0[job listing](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/rpa-developer-iii-at-united-wholesale-mortgage-4034330446/)\u00a0that\u2019s looking at Robotics Process Automation Development. In short, they want to automate some tasks at the organization and improve efficiency. This lead to ask myself why would a mortgage underwriter go out and hire AI developers to automate tasks? I think the answer is pretty simple. The individual underwriters at this organization take a MASSIVE chunk out of variable costs because they are the ones doing the work. What if the automation is for them to underwrite the mortgages themselves? If they can achieve this in totality, it would cut out over 20% of their expenses, and insane amount, not even counting the general and administrative costs they have to cover as well. My guess is that they are going to announce something with regards to AI and Automation of tasks at the next earnings meeting, and we all know how much Wall Street loves AI.\n\nThis is where things get fucking crazy. I wanted to buy options and I started looking at their volume and open interest. I started cataloging the Total Options Volume and Open Interest which is over 170,000. A MASSIVE, MASSIVE amount for a company of this size. Ok, but what if a lot of them are put options trying to sell it off? Nope.\u00a0**The P/CR is at 0.20 or lower. A P/CR this low means there are way more calls than puts.**\u00a0It\u2019s a sign that these people are heavy, heavy, on the bull side. The other part is the distribution upon which these calls are bought. Before new expiration dates were added and new strikes, the heaviest were concentrated around the 8, 9, and 10 dollar strikes for November 15^(th), the week after their earnings report. This past week they added strikes for the week of their ER, but there hasn\u2019t been any volume or OI at these strikes on this expiration. The next concertation of open interest and volume is actually for January/February of next year. And the funny part is they aren\u2019t arbitrary amounts like 736 or 643 or something like that.\u00a0**These buys are done in hundreds or thousands of contracts to a rounded amount. Today alone, 7,500+ contracts were bought TODAY at the 7c for 12/20 of this year. 15,000+ were bought TODAY for 8c, 11/15 the week after ER.**\u00a0\u00a0\n\nIf we were dealing with NVDA or MSFT or some other company, it probably would be some run of the mill type thing. But this is a company with 3 million shares left on the float. If UWMC reports strong earnings and we see a rate cut, People will buy up UWMC and those call options will go in-the-money, and there won\u2019t be any more shares left for purchase. Stock will likely go through the ROOF.\u00a0\u00a0think the hedges are planning something big on this one.\n\n\u00a0UWMC has a decent short interest with\u00a014.8 million shares\u00a0shorted with 6.7 days to cover. This is relatively high. If there\u2019s a squeeze, which is possible because of the gamma spike, the price might go to the moon. \n\n\n\nMy positions so far:\n\n11/15 8c 40\n\n11/15 9c 30\n\n11/15 10c 75\n\nAnd I\u2019m buying more.\n\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\u00a0\n\nTLDR: Buy UWMC, it's gonna moon\n\n\u00a0(This is not financial advice)",

After a sector has been on fire for weeks week, the question becomes what is left that still has juice?\n\n**The answer: Large Reactors. Specifically Brookfield Renewable Corp (BEPC)**\n\n  \n**LARGE REACTORS**\n\nSMRs have been getting all the attention in the media. When Mag7 talks about nuclear - they talk about SMR. Why? Small is beautiful. And less intimidating. This is more about optics that strategy.\n\nLets get into the data: *Altman wants multiple 5 GW AI centers built across the countr*y.\n\nSMRs produce yield 10 MW to 300 MW. And that upper end is theoretical, because none are in production. Even assuming a 300 Mwe output, that is 15 reactors per data center.\n\nLet's take a step back. Is the gov really going to start building dozens of SMRs at once - before a single one is up and running and established with a proven performance and safety record? Especially after decades of building scarcely any reactors at all?\n\nFar, far too much risk. Yes, there will be a handful of SMRs built to prove out the technology. This may take around a decade. *And then* those need to for a number of years (and likely be iterated upon) before these is the confidence to deploy these widely.\n\n**In sum, to go from 0 to many SMRs will take decades.**\n\n**We don\u2019t have decades. AI is a military horserace between the US and the rest of the world \u2013 particularly china \u2013 and in two decades the winner of that will already be decided.**\n\n  \nThe US needs to scale up nuclear energy production NOW. There is only one path to do that. And in sweeping report by the DOE - with industry and government as a target (i.e. no incentive to whitewash things by playing up SMRs) - the DOE outlines that plan:\n\n[https://liftoff.energy.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/LIFTOFF\\_DOE\\_AdvNuclear-vX7.pdf](https://liftoff.energy.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/LIFTOFF_DOE_AdvNuclear-vX7.pdf)\n\n  \nThe main parts of the report. \n\n- SMRs won't cut it for scaling out nuclear\n\n- They need \\*a single design of a large nuclear reactor\\*. \n\nIt must be a single design because of the realities of our national nuclear workforce. We don\u2019t have the technical expertise to have folks going around being one type of nuclear plant, re-tooling, re-trained \u2013 and then building a different design.\n\n- They want to run with something tried and true. Something we know from many years already that gets the job done. That people in our nation already have experience building and maintaining. **That friends is the AP1000.**\n\n**-\u00a0They want 5-10 new nuclear reactors \\*of that single design\\***\n\n**- They want that order to be placed before 2025**\n\n\n\nRelevant snips from the report:\n\n[Large Reactors are Will be The Bulk of Energy Production](https://preview.redd.it/9aektshonbwd1.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=367e220243be46d8185a744958e9818530fb68a5)\n\n[They Want to Order 5-10 Reactors in One Go](https://preview.redd.it/fcwok020obwd1.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=30c98e1c063e85c5f6b6c215f5d822713908a6f2)\n\n[AP1000 is the Design they Want](https://preview.redd.it/r01x3841obwd1.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=9c867e8ca8f5977fa0e704161e495ca6c102ebde)\n\n[They Want to Place these Orders Now](https://preview.redd.it/f37nrri9xbwd1.png?width=1053&format=png&auto=webp&s=b41798db75ddff864ceeb2d90d2c4984e0cba595)\n\n\n\n**INTERMISSION: PROJECT VOGTLE**\n\nWe are unambiguously on the eve on a nuclear renaissance. Yet there has basically only one major nuclear project in the US in the past four decades. *That project is Votgle.*\n\nLet that sink in.\n\nIf you happened to be a young buck in the 70s working on nuclear, maybe you have some experience on another major project. Odds are you are retired now, and it\u2019s a long distant memory at best.\u00a0 For absolutely everyone else \u2013 you only experience of a major reactor build is Votgle.\n\nProject Votgle was a beauty of a project. And what did they use? Westinghouse. In the 80s Westinghouse PWRs. And as recently as 2023, Westinghouse AP1000s.\n\nEveryone in the country has the same single reference for a major successful nuclear build-out. And it was built on the AP1000s\u2026You now have to build 5-10 nuclear plants of a single design asap.\n\nWhat are you going to pick?\n\nUnderstanding Vogtle makes it very clear while the DOE is so bullish on AP1000s in the report.\n\nNow onto BEPC...  \n\n\n**BEPC: THE WESTINGHOUSE STAKE**\n\nWestinghouse builds the AP1000s. And Westinghouse was bought out a few years ago by a consortium including BEPC. Hence BEPC is basically only one of two ways you can get exposure to Westinghouse. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/752veemapbwd1.png?width=1340&format=png&auto=webp&s=6bb8b0209a2eb693b873e9262b9975df933a881d\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/adwnem3hpbwd1.png?width=1050&format=png&auto=webp&s=99d40940a008486e0a3eff7aca09db83670019e4\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ruu2z75kpbwd1.png?width=1098&format=png&auto=webp&s=dbcfc93de40acb905f169b370058d5e542e23690\n\n\n\n**BEPC: THE MICROSOFT DEAL**\n\nYou may be familiar with CORZ, a bitcoin miner that has been running 300% on a deal for 200 MW of power. BEPC has a deal with MSFT for 50W. **That is 50x the power.** Let it sink in - \"largest ever corporate partnership\" and \"key enable of potentially one of the most significant technology innovations in history.\" This is not hyperbole. BEPC is a major player here.\n\n[https:\\/\\/bep.brookfield.com\\/sites\\/bep-brookfield-ir\\/files\\/Brookfield-BEP-IR-V2\\/2024\\/brookfield-renewable-corporate-profile-may-2024.pdf](https://preview.redd.it/n6ib4ccopbwd1.png?width=1070&format=png&auto=webp&s=8810295447003dc26912325356b808ef7a53ea0f)\n\n\n\n**BEPC: VALUATION AND CHART**\n\nWhat else is it important to know? The company is trading with a PE of \\~17 and dividend of 4%. This seems shockingly cheap compared to nearly every other nuclear trade. Or an energy supplier of any kind with key partnerships to the big AI players.\n\nThe chart to me is pure poetry. \n\nMy read - BEPC has seen very little of the froth hitting nuclear or energy in the past month - but over the past week the market is starting to wake up.\n\nMore or less the same setup when I picked up LEU calls that 10x'd once it rapidly re-rated. In that case I saw something that was starting to inflect, did a deep dive, liked what I saw and figured it had plenty more to run, and levered the fuck up.\n\nI think this could happen here as well. And on 30% move - which every nuclear play seems obligated to make, though at different times - the contracts are going to outright print.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ib52jc15vbwd1.png?width=1395&format=png&auto=webp&s=ab8fbc11ff885279491b1d8dc02e3da8bd22ff9b\n\nIn sum, long af BEPC calls of various strikes and expiries.  \n",

    "selftext": "\nTL;DR - Dad got cancer - so I went ham on investing \n\nI've been a long time lurker of this sub (and I never really post on reddit in general), but I didn't know where else to post this. I don't do options so maybe this is the wrong place lmao.\n\nI moved back home to my parents place when my dad was diagnosed with terminal brain cancer. Truthfully this has been the worst year of my life (and his obviously) in a lot of ways, but I've been investing since I was 16 (I'm 25 now). My dad worked in equities, so when he lost his ability to communicate effectively with me (and since I had significantly more income because I'm not paying rent) - I truthfully went ballistic on investing.\n\nPretty much said fuck it, I'm living at home I don't need a 6 month emergency fund till I move out and went all-in. Granted 40% of my portfolio not listed here is in a 401k account entirely in the S&P 500 (set & forget just in case my equities went to hell as with the rest of my life lol).\n\nI believe in the margin of safety when investing. I like to invest in high-quality companies that generate lots of cash as the backbone of my portfolio. Since 2021 (before my dad got this cancer shit), I spoke with him and he basically said just look at the fundamentals of a company and invest in growth companies that you think will be around in 5-10 years. I look for value within growth stocks (i know paradoxical). Some of my icons in investing are David Tepper & Michael Burry. Again below is all my own experience and reflects **only** my own views and are not a recommendation of my company (corporate. disclaimer).\n\n* My portfolio is heavily weighted (85%) between several stocks: AAPL, META, MSFT, GOOGL (So fucking cheap r u kidding me sorry), NVDA, AMZN, AMD, CRM, COST, RIVN (RIP), AVGO, VOO (ik not a stock) <-- I know semi(s) are very cyclical but i believe in holding all of these companies for 5-10 years, so I don't have to worry about temp. earnings beats/misses etc. Much easier to pick a stock and hold it for a while then it is to get the timing right. Roughly at 175% return in the past 3 years. (hammered META at $100's, NVDA at $200 both in 2022)\n* Roughly 15% of my bets are moonshots (note the word bet hehe) with promise but objectively could be overvalued/bad investments: CCL/RCL (both are crushing it and between them own 75% of the cruise line market), LCID/RIVN (going to 0 bc they can't scale profitably or will make u a very happy person 3 years down the line bc R2/Atlas at 45k/50k should capture a significant portion of model y demand), TTD, DKNG/FLUT - gambling hasn't even been legalized in Cali/Texas (the biggest markets in the U.S. come on), RBLX (feels like betting against youtube in the early innings w/o realizing how much rev. they're actually recognizing), PYPL (value - cheap af (bought at $60) should turn around in a couple years)\n\nI joke I allocate like google's budget where it's 90% bread&butter and the rest are moonshots.\n\nWas very depressed (still reasonably depressed) because I'm not sure how much time my dad has. I hope in a way I can pass some of these stocks to my kid in a better place than I found it. I don't know I'm crying as I write this. Fuck my life. It is what it is. \n\nCheers\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j8ym4lkamdvd1.png?width=1198&format=png&auto=webp&s=70c707919d6301944c8ff8cbbcb33ed03c9e6837",

    "title": "AI chipmaker Cerebras files for IPO to take on Nvidia - But 87% of its revenues have come from the UAE-G42 and U.S. Now Allows Nvidia Chips",
    "selftext": "The Middle East wants chips badly but US restrictions prevent the US most powerful chips entering into certain geographical areas such as China and the Middle East; this entails the UAE. Nevertheless, the UAE wants in on the GPU chips craze and is apparently willing to pay anything to enter into the chip bonanza. \n\nThe UAE can't get Nvidia's, AMD's, or Intel's best GPU chips so instead they are investing heavily into alternatives such as Cerebras. There is nothing inherently wrong with this but it's also the biggest red flag as an investment opportunity. If the agreements for Nvidia chips open up in the Middle East and specifically with the UAE that could be a crushing blow to this aspiring startup. \n\nSpecifically, Cerebras Systems reported a net loss of $66.6 million for the first six months of 2024, on $136.4 million in revenue. For the same period in 2023 it has a net loss of $77.8 million on just $8.7 million in sales. 87% of this revenue for the first half of 2024 was directly from the UAE G42. \n\nThe other red flag from this startup is the way in which they promote their business. It's all seemingly smoke and mirrors and conveniently based on outdated GPU pricing and throughput information; which is very publically available. \n\nFor some reason, Groq and Cerebras love to keep using memory to unlock speeds on small/tiny models which is impractical and inefficient for a scaled system; or a system that is a large foundational LLM. As well, they have no clue what models will do next so it's a major after the fact architecture that uses llama because they have access to it. [https://cerebras.ai/blog/introducing-cerebras-inference-ai-at-instant-speed.](https://cerebras.ai/blog/introducing-cerebras-inference-ai-at-instant-speed) A prime example of this is OpenAI's GPT-o1 model that uses reasoning in coordination with its model capabilities. Because they are not being used on the forefront of this technology they don't know how or when a model's size, function, or needs will evolve into the future. \n\nAll of this plus the pricing from OpenAI and Microsoft is coming down exponentially. \n\n**For Example**:\n\n1. They are referring to a 70b param model that shoves an entire model onto memory.\n2. They are going up against h100's which is a very old technology at this point. They make no reference to h200's let alone blackwell\n3. Because they are referencing such a small model the pricing model they suggest would be radically different for a 400b param model and forget about trillion param models which are coming next.\n4. They're not being truthful about tokens per s. As of today this is Azure GPT 4o and GPT 4 mini tokens per minute\n\n# gpt-4o & GPT-4 Turbo global standard\n\n|Model|Tier|Quota Limit in tokens per minute (TPM)|Requests per minute|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|`gpt-4o`|Enterprise agreement|30 M|180 K|\n|`gpt-4o-mini`|Enterprise agreement|50 M|300|\n\nAs you can clearly see 30 million tokens per minute is 500k tokens per second and mini is 833,333 tokens per second. So i don't know why they are referring to 20 tokens per second or their 450 tokens per second seems way off. maybe they mean million. Even if that is the case and 70 b would be more like mini it is way higher than their limit.\n\nOn pricing which they lay out a 3:1 input versus output is fine the price would be for mini which is a comparable model is roughly .10 cents (input) +  .20 cents = .30 cents. Per million.\n\nfor regular 4o it would be higher and let's face it GPT 4o is a far superior model than llama 3.1\n\n3.33 dollar + 5 = $8.33\n\n**Source:**\n\n[https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/cognitive-services/openai-service/](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/cognitive-services/openai-service/)\n\nFrom this information what I can tell you is that what we just went over is pricing. it is not some guarantee for what a model produces per second. That shit is very random. What I can tell you is from GPT 4 to GPT 4 turbo to Gpt 4o the speed is dramatically better. GPT 4o mini is damn near real time. Take that for what it's worth.\n\nI am not saying they're being dishonest here but I am saying they are being very cheeky with how they advertise things. \n\nThe company is currently being primarily supported by the UAE, with investments worth roughly $900 million for new AI supercomputers known as the Condor Galaxy series. Any growth here is singular to this source of investment and not driven by organic growth or usage. This is not a competitor to Nvidia but rather a temporary solution in the Middle East until chip embargoes are alleviated.\n\nThe media here loves to use sexy headlines on non-technical verifications of what it is they are actually comparing. I.e. H100's are now old, or The fact an entity may need to serve millions of clients... No they are instead reporting self-prompting headlines from Cerebras that say things like our chips are 20x faster than Nvidia. \n\n**Live Update:**\n\nAs I am writing and researching this topic it has just been reported by Reuters that the U.S. is setting a new rule to allow chip shipments to the Middle East including the UAE which is a boon to Nvidia and Microsoft. \n\n# [US sets new rule that could spur AI chip shipments to the Middle East](https://www.reuters.com/technology/us-sets-new-rule-that-could-spur-ai-chips-middle-east-2024-09-30/#:~:text=Public%20Policy-,US%20sets%20new%20rule%20that%20could%20spur,shipments%20to%20the%20Middle%20East&text=WASHINGTON%2C%20Sept%2030%20(Reuters),centers%20in%20the%20Middle%20East)\n\n**Here are couple excerpts:**\n\n>WASHINGTON, Sept 30 (Reuters) - The U.S. Commerce Department on Monday unveiled a rule that could ease shipments of artificial intelligence chips like those from Nvidia Corp\u00a0(NVDA.O),\u00a0to data centers in the Middle East.\n\n>G42, a UAE-based AI company with historic ties to China, has been a focus of those concerns. In April, Microsoft Corp.\u00a0[(MSFT.O), opens new tab](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/MSFT.O)\u00a0announced that it would invest $1.5 billion in the company, with plans to provide G42 with chips and model weights, sophisticated data that improves an AI model's ability to emulate human reasoning.The deal drew scrutiny from China hardliners in Congress, even though G42 said in February that it had divested from China and was accepting constraints imposed on it by the United States to work with American companies.\n\nLOL you can't make this up. Literally this just got reported by Reuters today 9/30/2024. This completely aligns with my argument above regarding the UAE-G42. \n\nWith chips now entering into the Middle East from Nvidia and potentially others I don't know how this startup IPO makes it off the ground. I don't mean to be bearish but I don't think this is the time for them to raise an IPO without showing more progress. I could be wrong. As of now, I don't plan on buying any shares. \n\nInstead, I will be adding more shares into Nvidia because now this is bullish news for Nvidia.  ",

Here\u2019s why:\n\n-\u00a0LEU is the only American company that enriches uranium today.\n\n-\u00a0It currently trades at 2.2x enterprise value / sales. It reported 189m of revenues last quarter.\n\nLets compare that valuation to the uranium miners. Of the one\u2019s producing revenue, they average \\~97x. If we reduce the comparison to the lowest, it is 10x. If you want to compare to the largest and most well-known, it is CCJ at 11x. Suffice to say, nuclear-related companies trade at very high multiples.\n\nMaybe they should be trading more in like with utilities with nuclear exposure. Well even here, the average is 5x.\n\n\u00a0The basic metrics for LEU and comparisons are below.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8lff6y73tzrd1.png?width=933&format=png&auto=webp&s=14eb43fc2ce5763e231a34873cd3699ce9869a58\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qgxfjb9kszrd1.png?width=433&format=png&auto=webp&s=9193bcfeba5278761e75ed692d49d9ca20da72d6\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jrbs7jkoszrd1.png?width=437&format=png&auto=webp&s=99de7d1637a38361112ecfc18f62687a2f246afe\n\n**Potential for Outsized Returns**\n\nIf LEU simply re-rates to \\~5x \u2013 which to me, would still be very conservatively valued \u2013 it would be \\~123 / share. January 80 strikes currently trade at \\~1.7. If that re-rate happened before then, the return would be \\~25x. I.e. (123 \u2013 80) / 1.7.\n\nThose kind of potential returns are exceptionally rare, even among contracts.\n\nI am not aware of any other nuclear related trades that could offer such an enormous return. Never mind such an enormous return on a relatively conservative premise, i.e. re-rating from \\~2.2 ev / sales to 5x.\n\nSo now that we have the most important elements out of the way, here is why I think Nuclear will be super hot, and more details on LEU specifically.\n\n\u00a0\n\n**US Nuclear Bull Thesis**\n\nAI is viewed by the Mag7-Military-Inudustial complex as being central to US political and economic hegemony. As such, they have pulled out all stops in terms expenditures. And the feds have operated at breakneck spread to buttress US advantage in AI via regulation. I.e. they have acted swiftly and aggressively to being as much of the supply chain within US national borders or control.\n\nAs AI has progressed, anything that has been revealed to be a bottleneck \u2013 whether semis, or data centers with ready powers supplies, or electrical companies, etc. has re-rated, often doubling, tripling, or more in breakneck speed.\n\nThe latest revealed bottleneck is energy. And apparently nuclear power is the only source that can viably satiate the projected energy needs. Hence the MSFT big for three mile island. I view this as the opening salvo. The other big AI players will need to secure nuclear sites in short order \u2013 perhaps they will be bidding against one another \u2013 given the limited number of existing nuclear sites. The news cycle for Nuclear is primed to get wild, and fast.\n\n[From Centrus Investor Presentation](https://preview.redd.it/h324mgwptzrd1.png?width=1523&format=png&auto=webp&s=e41640e6343ace47c1ead089327134cee30923ee)\n\n**LEUs role**\n\nThe US\u2019s largest vulnerability with respect to nuclear is that much of the supply chain is controlled by Russia. Given that (a) we are engaged with a proxy war with Russia, and (b) rapidly expanding nuclear power is now a major national security issue \u2013 I expect the Feds to act rapidly and decisively to remedy this issue.\n\nThe most obvious step to remedy this would be to provide substantial funding to support LEU\u2019s expansion of enrichment facilities within the US. When it comes to acting decisively and rapidly \u2013 the Feds almost always bet big on the most established players with the longest history. That is unambiguously LEU.\n\nBeyond the feds taking action, I think the Mag7 / utilities are going to be placing massive orders to secure future enriched uranium, as it becomes evident the number of active nuclear sites in the US is set to expand. LEU should be a recipient of much of these orders and see their backlog increase substantially. In sum, I think LEU is primed for a series of very positive press releases and generally a very bullish news cycle with respect to nuclear energy.\n\n[From Centrus Investor Presentation](https://preview.redd.it/nqfpuftktzrd1.png?width=1521&format=png&auto=webp&s=2589d749e180e841a56e128b814bb86fea259545)\n\n**Further Info**\n\nThere is plenty of other reasons to be bullish LEU, e.g. their strong relationships with SMR developers and the work they are doing with HALEU. However, I will end it here. If there is interest, I'll do a follow-up post. In the meantime if you want to dive further\n\nI suggest this video or a presentation the CEO just gave in DC.\n\n[https://x.com/centrus\\_energy/status/1838732746962743484](https://x.com/centrus_energy/status/1838732746962743484)\n\nTheir investor presentation is here\n\n[https://investors.centrusenergy.com/static-files/058b474a-c135-4600-a84b-e9908864a7a](https://investors.centrusenergy.com/static-files/058b474a-c135-4600-a84b-e9908864a7a)\n\n**Disclosure**  \nIn sum, I think conditions are perfect for the re-rate I described above.\n\nI am long LEU commons and calls of various strikes and expiry dates.",

    "title": "First DD: Bullish on Delta (DAL) through both technical and fundamental analysis in the medium term",
    "selftext": "**Overview**\u00a0\n\nThe airline industry is known for being highly competitive, with fuel prices exposure, high customer power, and sector overcrowding driving downward pressure on margins as well as shareholder returns. Airlines are also extremely capital-intensive and require large amounts of debt to finance their Boeing and Airbus fleets. This leads to large interest payments that further narrow margins. The large amount of debt also increases equity volatility, causing airline stocks to be more volatile. Therefore, it is no surprise that the airline industry underperforms the broader market significantly; since its inception in August 2014, the US JETS ETF has returned a total of \u201321% to shareholders over 10 years, or about \u20132% per year. \u00a0\u00a0\n\nDelta is a leader in this industry. In the past 4 months, Delta has dropped from its high of 54 to a low of around 38, a 30% drop characteristic of this volatile sector. This drop can be attributed to three key factors: 1) rising jet fuel prices and declining margins, 2) lower expectations for consumer confidence and air travel growth, and 3)\u00a0the CrowdStrike outage that wiped out 380 million in direct revenue for DAL. Delta currently hovers around 42 with a trailing PE of 6.1 and a forward PE of 5.9. In comparison, the broader airline industry trades at a median PE of 6.9 and forward PE of 5.6.\u00a0\n\nIt is empirically true that good companies in weak sectors can still generate strong returns; this is the case for Delta, a large company with strong FCF that many ignore or overlook due to the airline sector performance as a whole. My favorite long plays are on stocks with high volatility, attractive valuation, strong cash flows, and recent negative press that fails to fundamentally change its value proposition. Unfortunately, DAL fits all these criteria, and as a result I have come forth with a long thesis. \u00a0\n\n**Technical Analysis**\u00a0\n\n[20, 50, 200 MA for Delta on the daily chart from 2022-2024; signals 1, 2, 3 labeled](https://preview.redd.it/opj7jg4u33nd1.png?width=1433&format=png&auto=webp&s=e89e90d67a5cf9d1fc7f7934ccc65246100c162f)\n\nLooking at the past 3 years (post-COVID) graph of Delta, it becomes clear that airlines are volatile but also momentous in the longer term. The graph has long stretches of both bullish and bearish runs; to be profitable a trader will seek to time entries into long and shorts within the transition period between bearish and bullish, maximizing\u00a0exposure to\u00a0the longer-term trend. My thesis is that we are currently in one of these transition periods.\u00a0\n\nThe red, blue, and gold lines represent the 20, 50, and 200 MA on the daily chart, respectively. We use a combination of three bullish signals to propose a long entry:\u00a0\n\n* Signal 1: A downward trending 20MA crosses upward trending DAL on the daily chart\u00a0\n   * Out of the 11 occurrences in the past 3 years (red events), DAL has continued a bullish trend 10/11 (91%) times\u00a0\n   * Red event 4 is the only event that fails this signal, while red event 8 lead the bullish run by 1-2 months\u00a0\n   * In the past year, there has been 3 such occurrences, and DAL has continued a bullish trend 100% of the time\u00a0\n   * The last occurrence was 2 weeks ago\u00a0\n* Signal 2: A downward trending 50MA crosses upward trending DAL on the daily chart, typically following signal 2 after 1-3 weeks\u00a0\n   * Out of the 7 occurrences in the past 3 years (blue events), DAL has continued a bullish trend 7/7 (100%) times\u00a0\n   * The 8th occurrence was yesterday\u00a0\n* Signal 3: An upward trending 200MA crosses a faster, upward trending DAL on the daily chart, typically following signal 2 after 1-3 weeks\u00a0\n   * Out of the 2 occurrences in the past 2 years (yellow events), DAL has continued a long bullish trend 2/2 (100%) times\u00a0\n   * The 200MA has begun trending upward post COVID since April 2023 and continues its momentum\u00a0\n   * The 3^(rd) occurrence will likely be within the next 2 weeks\n\nThese three signals consecutively have signaled strong bullish trends lasting 2-5 months representing 46% and 40% returns, respectively (34-50 and (34-50 and 38-53). We are now sitting at 42, with these three signals poised to align again. The current RSI14 is not high or low but rising, indicating growing momentum. However, we may be cautionary due to the lower-than-average trading volume during the past 2-3 weeks.\u00a0\n\nTaken together, we project a conservative price target of 56, representing 34% return, within the next 4 months.\u00a0\n\nNow, before we lose our entire portfolio, let's turn to the fundamentals, as just looking at technical signals is like driving a car by only looking through the rear-view mirror.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n**Fundamental Analysis**\u00a0\n\nDespite the underperforming and highly competitive airlines industry, Delta is well positioned in the industry. Competition and strategic differentiation by price currently favor premium airlines (see: [Budget Airlines Want to Go Premium. That\u2019s Easier Said Than Done.](https://www.wsj.com/business/airlines/budget-airlines-premium-perks-245a1d61)) As other airlines struggle to compete, Delta can capture a larger percentage of the total market in the short term. As a premium airline with brand strength, Delta\u2019s pricing power will remain until its competitors can effectively compete on quality and experience.\u00a0\n\nFurthermore, the airline industry has excess capacity as airlines were overly optimistic about demand forecasts post-COVID. As volume players correct overexpansion of routes while shifting away from volume towards quality, we can expect more rational price discipline and subsequent price premiums (and margins) to increase. While 90% of corporations do not expect corporate air travel demand to soften ([Delta Air Lines, Inc. - Delta Air Lines Announces June Quarter 2024 Financial Results)](https://ir.delta.com/news/news-details/2024/Delta-Air-Lines-Announces-June-Quarter-2024-Financial-Results/default.aspx), slowing growth coupled with higher ROIC is preferable to value destruction; Delta\u2019s key ratios ([DAL (Delta Air Lines) 1-Year ROIIC % (gurufocus.com),](https://www.gurufocus.com/term/roiic-1y/DAL) [DAL | Overview (valueinvesting.io)](https://valueinvesting.io/DAL/overview)) show ROIC strength compared to industry peers, as well as ROIC higher than cost of capital.\u00a0\n\nFuel cost impacts on margin may also trend favorably for airlines, as oil prices drop in the short term. With the markets potentially pricing in a Trump presidency, we may see fuel-cost tailwinds for Delta.\u00a0\n\nAnother short-term consideration has been the CrowdStrike outage; while investors have been pricing in the revenue hit, the scale and timeline of Delta\u2019s recovery is still in speculation.\u00a0Known for their operational prowess, this one-time, one-week fiasco is unlikely to have changed much except for the direct revenue hit. This event may have led to DAL being oversold in the short term (2 weeks ago). \u00a0\n\nA 5-year growth-exit DCF valuation gives a fair value of 64, well above our price target of 56 from earlier:\u00a0[Delta DCF Valuation | Delta Air Lines Inc (DAL) (valueinvesting.io)](https://valueinvesting.io/DAL/valuation/dcf-growth-exit-5y)\u00a0\n\n* Above model makes reasonable revenue growth assumptions\u00a0\n   * Model projects DAL revenue CAGR of 4.77%\u00a0\n      * Past 15 years, DAL revenue CAGR is 5.75%, or 6.24% removing COVID years\u00a0\n      * Growth projection supported by DAL 200MA\u00a0\n   * CAPEX assumptions are reasonable (11% consistent with historical)\u00a0\n   * Terminal growth rate of 0.5%, Terminal Value 75% of EV \u2013 reasonable\u00a0\n      * US population growth of 0.4% but trending downward\u00a0\n      * US GDP growth 2-3%\u00a0\n   * Airline industry unlikely to be replaced in the next decades\u00a0\n* Note: if you check out the other valuation models at the above link, all but the earnings power value model forecasts a much higher fair value than the current price of 42\u00a0\n   * This is due to the earnings power value model being reliant on historical earnings, which are heavily skewed due to COVID in 2020 and 2021\u00a0\n\nOther notes:\u00a0\n\n* Delta\u2019s fleet is 40% airbus, making it less exposed to Boeing than other airlines\u00a0\n* Recent US Dept. Of Transportation inquiry may impact share price(airlines including DAL must submit a report within 90 days: [Federal probe targets airline frequent flyer programs | CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/05/travel/airline-loyalty-frequent-flyer-dot-probe/index.html)\u00a0\n* Ongoing litigation with CRWD and MSFT, burden of proof\u00a0\n\nOur fundamental analysis reaches the conclusion that DAL is undervalued, with the reason for lower multiplies possibly being attributable to the competitiveness of the industry, macroeconomic and consumer spend caution in the short term,\u00a0jet fuel price uncertainty, and negative events in the short term. DAL should continue to enjoy strong cash flows as it reduces debt,\u00a0strengthens its\u00a0brand, and diversifies cash flows (56% of revenue from premium, loyalty, and other streams) in the unattractive airline industry. \u00a0\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nCombining technical and fundamental, we can confidently enter long on DAL with a time horizon of the next two quarters; I am looking to trade DAL at a good time, not a long time. Given this timeframe, here are my (updated) positions:\u00a0\n\n* 30 Dec20-24 50 calls at 1.07 -> 3210\n* 20 Jan17-25 50 calls at 1.4 -> 3800\n* 40 Jan17-25 55 calls at 0.67 -> 2680\n\nThese positions represent a net cost value of 9.69k. May add on more.\n\ntldr; bullish Delta (DAL) through both a fundamental and technical perspective, currently at a cheap valuation with technical momentum\u00a0",

I think this month provides clarity if this is a longer term market correction, or if we are about to rebound. If it's a broader correction, big boys should pivot out of US equities, into bonds.

    "selftext": "The problem areas in the USA: --------------------------\n\n\\*- The Schiller PE is at a very high level.  Only higher in 2021 and the Dot Com bubble.  So stocks are highly expensive.\n\n\\*- ISM manufacturing index has been in contraction since mid 2022!  We are more of a service economy than a goods economy,  but still when you have stocks priced for perfection this isn't what you want happening if you are a bull.\n\n\\*-  World's #2 economy, China is no longer growing to the point that it can move the global needle.  That is, global sales growing to the point where a company's local USA sales declines are offset.  Additionally the trade war hampers both sides.\n\n\\*- The consumer's savings have dropped back to 2022 levels.\n\n\\*- NVidia's leadership of the gainers was not sustainable and my one man's opinion is because their valuation is ten times the cash in the bank of all of their AI customers.  You have price to sales of 10 for all the money your customers could possibly spend on anything AI that NVidia sells in the short term.  People have said on this point that future earnings will be available and that customers can go to a bank.  However, clearly the price is high when you compare to say MKS Instruments and Applied Materials.  AMAT has more cash in the bank than MKSI is worth.  AMAT is MKSI's biggest customer, having a disproportionately large percentage of its sales.  So this means that in the short term, there is monetary potential energy for MKSI without loans nor future earnings, but it is not the same potential energy for NVidia.  This is not a marketing of MKSI stock BTW.  I don't own any MKSI.  This point applies to NVidia's AI GPUs that certainly the average person is not affording.  So the cash on hand is from MSFT, GOOG, META, AMZN.\n\nGood areas: --------------------------------------\n\n\\*- Labor productivity is up consistently since Q3 2022.  one can see \n\ntradingeconomics dot com USA productivity\n\n\\*- Gasoline is lower than last year\n\n\\*- Retail sales are going fine, \\[ per  a recent NPR radio article \\]\n\nNuetral ----------------------------------------\n\n\\*- Labor force participation is not higher than Sept 2023.  No more sales growth from people returning to work.  Participation is up recently. tradingeconomics has this info.\n\n\\*- Consumer confidence is still down since January 2020.\n\nMy one man's take ----------------\n\nThe problem areas are serious.  There is enough weight in the bear issues to cause the stock market to give up most of its gains this year.",

    "title": "NVDA will hit 5T market cap in 2026, and 10T market cap before 2032.",
    "selftext": "Hi regards,\n\nThis is not a \"copium\" post about the recent stock price drops.\n\nI am a 3rd world country regard who is a Software Engineer and I will share my insights into the industry with my broken ass English, if you want to join me on this journey, be my guest.\n\nThe problem with NVDA is that they are \"overhyped\" not \"overpriced\". Some of you regards might say that \"OH THEIR STOCK PRICE INCREASED 150% YOY HOW IS THAT NOT OVERPRICED\", I will kindly ask you to check their income growth, which sits at 122% YOY.\n\nFirst of all, lets compare some other tech giants earnings to NVDA earnings to see what they are \"worth now\".\n\n|Name|Stock price|EPS|SP/EPS ratio|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|AAPL|230|1,4|164|\n|MSFT|413|2,95|140|\n|AMD|145|0,16|1.035|\n|META|516|5,16|100|\n|AMZN|171|1,26|135|\n|NVDA|116|0,68|170|\n\nAs you can see above, they are not overpriced related to their current earnings. And I think that them going back to 110 will set them good for later improvements. But them getting hyped beyond recognition was the sole reason for them being priced at 130 per price.\n\nBut before jumping into the NVDA analysis, lets go over every single tech stock in that list.\n\n## AAPL\n\nLatest thing they achieved was M1 chip, converting old and worthless Macbook Pro hardware into a performing machine with great battery life. This was also accompanied by the fact that they can charge a premium for small hardware upgrades (200$ for a simple 256GB storage?), which helped them to sell new computers to their old customers and gain huge profits.\n\nHow do I know this? Because after 2021, when M1 chip proved to be powerful and resourceful, most of our Macbook stack got renewed. I was using a 6 years old work Macbook before that, because newer Intel Macbooks did not promise anything new.\n\nBut this was 3 years ago. Now, they are pretty much failing to create new income markets. Their latest tech demo \"Vision Pro\" failed miserably. Their only means to increase their income is to sell more hardware to push their services (AppStore and stuff), but this is also under investigation and they probably will have to open up their ecosystem more.\n\n## MSFT\n\nThey did suck tits before Nadella became a CEO. They tried to be a \"everything\" company but everything they did suck. Then Nadella came and transformed the rotting corpse of MSFT on the Golden Throne into the Cloud giant they are.\n\nThey are platformless. Their services are used everywhere. They are bringing Windows into ARM devices (again) and it does not suck this time. New ARM platform seems to outperform M series Macbooks in battery performance, which will end years of Macbook supremacy.\n\nThey are agile. They set and integrate trends easier. Game Pass? Azure? Cloud Office?\n\n## AMD\n\nI am a fellow AMD user (7900XTX gang?) and oh boy they are at least a few years behind in datacenter solutions. Also given their driver problem history on Desktop, power draw problems and other bugs, they need more resources to fix their problems first.\n\nAlso, sadly, they do not have CUDA. Personally, I am training some neural networks on my 7900XTX and it is 5 to 10 times faster than my CPU but also 5 to 10 times slower than NVDA counterpart. And also, I have to put in the extra work to find that specific framework that works with AMD and make the very specific adjustments before even I can start using the hardware.\n\nEven if their hardware can match NVDA, it is like having a really fast fighter jet without any software assistance, yeah you can MAYBE safely take off if you work hard enough, but you will never win against the jest with a strong software.\n\nAnd no one is buying their data center products (Other than their CPU's). I will get on this in NVDA's section.\n\n## META\n\nThey are a \"AD\" company, just like Google. They have some \"long game\" products (Metaverse and Google Self Driving as much as you joke them), but they are far from ALPHA phase. If they can show the world that this is the future, they might get a 60% to 90% increase in their value.\n\nALSO THEY ARE BUYING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF WORTH NVDA PRODUCTS.\n\n## AMZN\n\nThe \"everything company\". They are big. But not as much profitable as the rest. For me, their biggest product is AWS. If they can create a new income source they will be the next 3T company, may be even earlier than GOOGL.\n\n# NVDA\n\nAND OUR STAR CHILD.\nHOT TOPIC OF 2024.\nTHE FUTURE OF THE WORLD.\n\nDo you remember when they wanted to acquire ARM? This was back in 2020, when their market cap was around 145 BILLION. Do you know how much they were willing to spend on ARM? 40 BILLION DOLLARS. This was before the AI craze and boom in their revenue.\n\nSo why did NVDA wanted to acquire ARM? For their CPU's of course. They are going to create the Apple way of Datacenters. Soft spot of H100 series was their lack of integration between CPU and GPU. Blackwell aims to solve this. Finally, they are creating a whole SOC, with their new CPU, Grace.\n\nRemember what I told you in AAPL's section? The way their tight integration of M series chips with rest of the system made their profits skyrocket? Do you see what will Blackwell do for NVDA now?\n\nH100 users will have a clear path to upgrade, and with their newest technology, they will get MORE OF THE PIE on the single server rack. If NVDA made X thousand dollars of profits from a single server rack from H100 users, this will definitely go beyond 4X mark with Blackwell.\n\nAnd I previously mentioned no one was buying AMD. This was because in our company, we have bought A MILLION DOLLARS worth of NVDA datacenter products. There was a discussion in our team, if we should buy AMD datacenter GPU's because it was WAY cheaper, I mean 4-5 times cheaper. Everyone disagreed and we went with the NVDA GPU and AMD CPU, and we are just one team in a huge company.\n\nRemember when I told you I was a THIRD WORLD REGARD? Yeah. NVDA technologies are just spreading to this part of the world. Even we are spending MILLIONS of dollars for NVDA. And we are just starting to build up our NVDA datacenters. What do you think in 5 years, when it is time to upgrade, do you think that we will switch our provider and ditch all the work? Or do you think that we will go with NVDA and make them rich?\n\nLet the bears win some battles, so NVDA can win the war.\n\nEDIT: forgor some words",

    "title": "The next tech giant. Why $HOOD, $PLTR and $DKNG are the investment opportunities of a lifetime. (Part 1)",
    "selftext": "I believe the story of the last 20 years of stock market is that one tech startup can disrupt an entire sector and join the tech giant club. For many sectors, information is king and turns out a company with a few 1000 people who have studied the science of information can outperform millions of people who aren't so scientifically rigorous. Now some sectors are not so prone to be disrupted by these information science experts. And if you asked me 20 years ago which sectors will be disrupted in what order, I would've guessed wrong.\n\n$AMZN Turns out the value of millions of retail stores across the west was not in their inventory, their brand or their location. Amazon proved their value was in knowing who wants what item when and where. Information. How can millions of retail shop compete with amazon when they already have my payment information (how) my location (where) and all amazon has to figure out is what do I want, which I'm happy to tell them by typing one word or expression in a search bar instead of walking around Home Depot trying to find a employee who's not too busy and has every reason to avoid me. Sentences and social interactions just can't compete with 1s and 0s. Now I wish I figured this all out 20 years ago when amazon still a great investment opportunity, but how could I have known Jeff would overcome all the hurdles by building this impossible network of warehouses and delivery. I won't make the same mistake twice.\n\n$NFLX (movies). $SPOT (music) $GOOG,$META(ads, communication, media), $AAPL, $MSFT etc... These are 100% information sectors that I would've guessed would be disrupted. But these were winner takes all. How could I know Facebook wouldn't fail like MySpace and Friendster? That iphones would be better than blackberry and nokia? How could I know Yahoo would become a total failure when they had such a commanding lead in the early internet era. These stocks will keep going up but they're not the 100 baggers they once were.\n\nAnd so in true\u00a0wsb\u00a0fashion, the question becomes, what tech startup is poised to do the same thing to their respective sector. Let's assume no company can be worth over $5T in the next 10 years. We need a company worth less than $50B whose sector is still ripe for the taking, and whose in the business of information. A sector whose legal hurdles have kept the incumbents safe from the efficiency of tech startups. A sector who created legal barriers that could resist a decade longer than taxi drivers could resist $Uber, or hotels vs $ABNB.\n\nThere are 3 answers : Finance, defense and gambling. These sectors have the highest barrier to entry of any. Their regulatory agencies are basically just a revolving door between government and industry. They are the most regulated sectors out there but they are finally starting to crack. Crony capitalism only works for so long.\n\nFrom a pure computer science perspective, overtaking these sectors is not technical challenge, in the same way Unity is failing at becoming the universal game engine. There's no legal barrier to become a game engine. Activison, Take two interactive, Ubisoft, etc.. everyone wants $U to succeed but they're now years behind on their promised revolutionary Data oriented technology stack. Everyone wants $TSLA Full self driving to succeed, but they're years behind Musk's first promises of success by what? 2017?. But those are technically hard challenges, maybe impossible with current hardware limitations. Now if you want to bet on their success, good luck to you but I'm not interested in those investments. Only someone at the cutting-edge of those technologies can make well-informed decisions. Only someone at the cutting-edge of semi conducters could've guessed $NVDA would obliterate intel and amd. I won't pretend to have any such knowledge about the future as I make these observations about the past. This is not what this tech investment thesis is about.\n\nAnd so in conclusion, three stocks stand out in their positioning and the state of their respective industry :\n\nIf you are under 40 years old, $HOOD (Finance), $PLTR (Defense) and $DKNG (gambling) will 100x during your investment horizon. Part 2 tomorrow as I dive deeper on all 3.",

They are frequently gamers, so they need to buy NVDA GPUs and AMD CPUs. They often buy these at AMZN.\n\nThey buy YouTube Premium and YouTube TV, so they can skip the ads of their fellow influencers (GOOGL)\n\nThey spent most of their waking hours at META's Instagram website.\n\nThey drive a TSLA or RIVN.\n\nThey're on the GLP-1 drug (LLY) to impress their SOs.\n\nThey're churning their credit cards with AXP Platinum and Gold, JPM's Chase Sapphire Preffered (no, NOT Reserve), some younger ones need to rely on COF's Venture and Venture X cards that gave nice \"subs\".\n\nThey use these cards frequently to eat out and earn those points at CMG, SHAK and SG.\n\nThey're flying a lot on DAL, and they need their free wifi that is often sponsored by their preferred choice of mobile carrier, TMUS.\n\nTo get to the airport they need to use UBER or LYFT, since they don't want to drive their sweet electric ride. When they arrive at their destination airport, they pick up their rental car, and of course they prefer AVIS (CAR), but their credit cards give them presential circle status on HTZ, so they are ok with that too.\n\nThey check into their hotel room at Marriott (MAR) to impress their friends, but really they are using all their Chase points to book Hyatt (H) hotels. The slightly less premium young ones will have to go Hilton (HLT) and fly on UAL.\n\nThey often booked all this travel on EXPE or BKNG. Sometimes they use ABNB.\n\nWhen they check in they need to get some food, so they use their DASH gift card they bought at COST every two weeks because they get 20% off.\n\nWhen they go to Vegas, they prefer to stay in WYNN, because it's where all the hot ones stay.\n\nAfter they're done with their holidaying which they do basically 4 months out of the year, they're going to ULTA or LULU to buy their beauty products or Khakis.\n\nThey are drop shipping on SHOP and sometimes they need to use ZM to conduct \"business\" for their \"coaching classes\" that they teach. A lot of times they get paid using Venmo (PYPL).\n\nWhatever money they make, they buy call options on HOOD.\n\nAt the end of the day their sugar daddy's give them a $1m deposit so they can buy those nice suburban homes built by TOL and furnished by WSM.\n\nAnd of course, they spend their entire day on RDDT.",

    "title": "NVDA will beat earnings again this month!",
    "selftext": "Just to be clear this is not financial advice, and there are more factors than an earnings beat that affect stock price, but this is why I think NVDA will beat revenue predictions of $28B on Aug 28th 2024.\n\nThis article https://observer.com/2024/06/nvidia-largest-ai-chip-customers/ lists MSFT and META as the 2 biggest customers of NVDA chips last year (they spent $9B in 2023). Their total capex for 2023 is $55.3B combined. Which means that they spent 16.2% of their total Capex spending in 2023 on NVDA chips alone. So I looked at their Capex for this last quarter, which is $22.04B combined, up from $15.17B combined in Q2 2023 (up 45% YoY). The article also states that these 2 along with AMZN, and GOOGL make up a little less than 40% of all NVDA chip sales in 2023. So, I looked at their numbers as well. AMZN and GOOGL in Q2-2024 spent $30.80B on Capex, up from $18.33B in Q2 2023 (up 68% YoY). If we use the 16.2% of their capex rule on NVDA from 2023 then combined the 4 companies spent $8.56B in Q2 alone this quarter on NVDA chips.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fw6ulcq1nhhd1.png?width=606&format=png&auto=webp&s=c5f045bd5d7c8d10238567c37837319ed8ca71e3\n\nBut I think with such a huge increase YoY on Capex spending that the total % spent of capex on NVDA chips is closer to 30% at least. Which would mean they spent $15.82B on NVDA chips last quarter. Looking at NVDA\u2019s Q1 earnings they reported $22.5B in datacenter chip sales Q1. Meaning potentially 40% of their customer base has already purchased 75% of their total revenue in chip sales from Q1 2024 in Q2 2024. NVDA in their first quarter presentation is expecting $28.0B in total revenue for Q2 2024, which is 7.52% higher than what they reported in Q1 ($26.04B). Yet their biggest customers are reporting an avg increase in Capex spending of 19.33% from Q1 to Q2 in 2024. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ezyilod4ohhd1.png?width=846&format=png&auto=webp&s=e0db445fd539a08346afa26a840fd2253e9e0140\n\nI think this is a no brainer beat of the predicted $28B in revenue. Yet impacts to profit margins, chip shortages, and guidance changes of 2025 that are unknown mean the price action can't be accurately predicted. Invest at your own risk. I would love to hear others opinions on this upcoming earnings for NVDA and what they think could be reported.",

    "selftext": "The overwhelming sentiment I see here and from financial analysts regarding AI is that it's this hugely speculative new tech that has yet to yield any substantive fruit. \"What's the use case?\" \"Where are the giant growth numbers?\"\n\nAnd yet, in the early days of using generative AI, if the low-hanging fruit is simply increases in efficiency and easy-to-automate processes being automated, what we'd expect to see is not ballooning growth, but similar productivity with fewer human workers, wouldn't we? And don't the numbers support exactly that?\n\nThe sector with the [highest unemployment rate is IT](https://www.statista.com/statistics/217787/unemployment-rate-in-the-united-states-by-industry-and-class-of-worker/).\n\nFrom the newest [Jobs Report](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm):\n\n>Employment continued to trend up in health care, in construction, and in transportation and warehousing, **while information lost jobs**.\n\nThere are other possible explanations for this trend. There could still be a surplus of IT workers even with high demand. Tech companies over-hired.\n\nBut a completely consistent narrative that many people seem to be ignoring is that the payoff from AI investment is already happening in the form of significant efficiency gains in the IT sector.\n\nTake [Meta's recent earnings call](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/31/meta-advertising-growth-proof-that-hefty-ai-spending-is-paying-off.html).\n\n>After the company\u2019s better-than-expected\u00a0[second-quarter earnings report](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/31/meta-earnings-q2-2024.html)\u00a0on Wednesday, Zuckerberg and finance chief Susan Li rattled off all the ways that AI has helped the company grow faster than the competition in the digital advertising market, Meta\u2019s core business.\n\n\u201cThe ways that it\u2019s improving recommendations and helping people find better content, as well as making the advertising experiences more effective, I think there\u2019s a lot of upside there,\u201d Zuckerberg said on the earnings call. \u201cThose are already products that are at scale. The AI work that we\u2019re doing is going to improve that.\u201d\n\nand\n\n>Meta reported revenue growth of 22% from a year earlier to $39.07 billion, with 98% of its sales coming from advertising, primarily on Facebook and Instagram. **Its growth rate was double that of Google\u2019s ad business**\n\nNow Zuck could be full of shit, and the increase is not attributable to AI, but to other factors. Or. Or. He's correct, and Meta has already done a very good job of figuring out how to leverage AI to increase profits, even after multiple rounds of layoffs in the last few years.\n\nGotta admit, the last couple of weeks have been scary. And I'm not 100% on this thesis (I'm sure many of you will find joy in poking holes in it). But I'm still predominantly bullish on AI. Not just as a long-term play, but as a near and long term play. I've still got 2/3rds of my stocks in NVDA/AMZN/GOOG/MSFT, with a handful of calls on these stocks and META with expiries 1-2 months out.\n\nTLDR: Declining jobs numbers, especially in IT, are completely consistent with what we'd expect to see if AI investment was already starting to pay off. Bears should maybe mull this over instead of screaming 'AI BUBBLE' every fucking chance they get.",

Only then, will the insane articles that read blatant idiocracy stop printing.

Keep thinking this.\n* Nobody is making money from AI\n   * Not true\n* Google is building their own chips\n   * And they buy hella Nvidia chips\n* AMD is competition\n   * Cuda\n* We are building our own chips\n   * Where?\n* We can't afford the chips because our car company isn't profitable so I'd rather invest in Dojo with Broadcom\n   * Ok - good for you\n* ChatGPT lost 5 billion (but made 5 billion itself)\n   * Do you think they are just going to be buying chips forever? At some point the ROI will fully kick in. It is going to take 1 or perhaps 2 more foundational models to enter into the system before that happens.\n* A Google search query uses 10x less energy than a GPT query\n   * Here is the thing. When I GPT something I don't need to browse 100 websites to get one answer. Has anyone thought of that? I bet if you redid the study and actually included the practicality of asking something and getting a direct answer they would tell you that is a large cost savings.\n* AI is a bubble - My personal favorite\n   * Terminator say no\n\nThe list goes on folks.\n\nWhat are we even doing here?\n\nIt's time to pack up and go home.

And then there is the constant barrage of media stories moving people's perceptions. Don't be fooled by the noise. That is your alpha. \n\n**So what is true?** \n\nComputers can now read and write.

You can't have this kind of transformation without people getting overexcited for a few years. But we aren't at that stage yet. Look at how long the dotcom bubble took, and more importantly, look how the late stage was characterized - explosion of IPOs. Until we get a flood of IPOs, we aren't in the late stage. Until we see an IPO for SexRobots Inc, we aren't in the late stage.  \n\n  \nAt the moment we've got a handful of companies beating expectations because of AI revenue (good for Nvidia, long-term), and some beating CapEx expectations because of AI spending (good for Nvidia, short-term)\n\n  \n**The current situation**\n\nLook at Nvidia P/E compared to its share price. We're halfway through the year. At the end of this fiscal year, Nvidia will be worth $180 at the midline of this trend. It is currently $113. That is a 57% return, 157% on an annualized basis. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i4tguqzn8yed1.png?width=2324&format=png&auto=webp&s=d0e0112355ff9ff89dac811c03202050eadf34a6\n\nNvidia is down 17% from its peak. Its hard to call the bottom, but yesterday we saw a major flash crash followed by a v back up. Much like the opposite of the \"blow-off\" tops that we see when the bull runs peak. \n\nBig volume selling, big volume buying. Big down, big up. \n\nI expect the fast bears used that to get out. The slow ones will watch their profits start eroding before also bailing and taking their gains. The slower ones will hit their stop losses, and the slowest will drift back into the red.\n\nIf you're a bear in the green, take the W and get out\n\n\n\n**Upcoming catalysts**\n\nOther company earnings next week - MSFT, META, SNAP, AMD, ARM  \n\n\n**Upcoming earnings**\n\nWhat are the market expectations for next earnings? They say they are expecting $0.59  per share. But last quarter Nvidia made that, on the back of 26B in revenue. For this quarter, Nvidia predicted 28B revenue. If they hit that, we're looking at $0.66. But of course they're being conservative. Why wouldn't they? When your growth is 262% you have plenty of room to estimate conservatively. \n\nHow conservative are they usually? Last time they predicted 24B and hit 26B. If roughly that amount extra happens again, we're looking at 30B in revenue and $0.70 in profit. \n\n  \n**My positions**\n\n$100 call 8/16 expiration (bought +20 for $32,000) \n\nDon't do what I do.

On top of that its a bootable driver, so it loads as soon as you turn on the computer. I cant speak for all drivers, but at least in the case of NVDA driver updates to graphics cards, they have to go through Microsoft testing, which is done by Microsoft to determine it is functional and doesnt cause any issues before providing a certificate to let that driver be published. \n\nAs for Crowdstrike, being the incredibly fast and up to the minute protection, they dont have time to do a certificate test to get an approval from microsoft, so they change 1 text file, and push it to all of the machines using their driver. Well on friday, we all saw that driver failed to boot due to an error in the text file. I believe it was a file full of 0's?\n\nBlame the EU for allowing Kernel access in the first place, as they didnt want MSFT to have a monopoly on a virus protector. \n\nWhat could very well happen in the long term is Crowdstrike will get their kernel access removed, or be required to update their certificate every time they have an update. **Getting their kernel access removed, would make the an average run of the mill virus scanner, and if they are required to update their certificate every time, they would then be behind the ball in terms of protection as a threat would potentially have days/weeks to infiltrate before Crowdstrike gets to update.** \n\nIn the short term, I also believe customers will break their contracts and move to competitors.

    "selftext": "Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) plans to almost double its capital expenditures from $32B in fiscal year 2023 to $63B in fiscal year 2025, according to a forecast by Morgan Stanley.\n\nMuch of the new capex is devoted to generative artificial intelligence, but some investors question how much return on investment this spend will produce.\n\nMorgan Stanley expects capex to increase from $16B to $23B for data center capacity to support expanding GenAI revenue streams from Azure AI Services, M365 Copilot and GitHub Copilot.\n\n\"This supports a ramp in GenAI revenues from $5.3B in FY24 to $37.9B in FY27, with an implied assumption of GenAI gross margins of ~50% in FY27,\" said Morgan Stanley analysts Keith Weiss, Josh Baer and Theodor Thun, in a research note on Wednesday.\n\nMicrosoft's non-GenAI related data center spend is forecasts to rise from $32B to $48B from fiscal year 2024 to fiscal year 2027.\n\n\"This supports a ramp in non-GenAI Cloud revenues from $132B in FY24 to $215B in FY27, with capex intensity modestly improving from 24% to 19% during that period,\" Weiss noted.\n\nCapex growth outside of data center build outs is much less extensive. Morgan Stanley forecasts this area to grow modestly from $3.7B during fiscal year 2024 to $4.8B by fiscal year 2027.\n\n\"While the analysis does suggest Microsoft's GenAI market share exceeds its current software share, our survey work is very supportive of Microsoft accruing additional IT Wallet Share as investment in GenAI ramps,\" Weiss added. \"That said, the limited implied growth in GenAI capex seems at odds with the broader industry discussion on ramping data center build outs and highlights several components necessitating future analysis.\"\n\nOne key variable in the analysis is the expense of expanding computing platforms for OpenAI's training models.\n\n\"With little detail on the magnitude of these efforts, we assume figures smaller relative to those speculated within OpenAI,\" Weiss said",

    "selftext": "I got to try Microsoft's copilot this week and i have to say i was underwhelmed by what it had to offer. It just felt like an enhancement for windows with more features, nothing ground breaking. This wasn't a major leap in technology like going from fax's to email. Tech companies releasing new (free)upgrades and new (free)products is like Nike releasing a new pair of shoes, just something else to add to the lineup. Will it make SOME peoples jobs more efficient, yes. Is it applicable for most people, i have to say no. Nike makes shoes for athletes but maybe 1-2% actually use them for what its intended for. Lets say a company has 20,000 employees, of those employees how many need it for their role or will using it on a daily basis? Maybe 90 % wont. If that's accurate a company will only pay for the 10% that need a user license.\n\nIf chat GPT was never released all the mag 7 earnings would still be about the same without it.\n\nNow for the overvalued and overbought. MSFT has a PE of 40, one of the highest of all the mag 7. You're paying $40 for every dollar they earn. Based on their current AI stack im not sure they will be able to beat the current expectations in a big way consistently. MSFT is not NVDA. NVDA chips cost $30k+ each, as much as a low end Tesla. Copilot has a free version and the pro version is $20-$30 per user. Most people at companies are not using this and im not sure this will add to the bottom line very much. That means most of the earnings growth will have to come from the cloud business, admittedly the cloud business has been growing at double digits for a long time but there is also a lot of competition in cloud space, at some point growth will slow as cap ex spending slows. The other thing to consider is what AI costs for these companies. The GPU's are expensive, Data storage is expensive and the energy demand from AI use is very very expensive. At some point AI use, especially from free users is going to eat into the profit margins.\n\nMSFT right now is like buying a over priced Cadillac, yeah it drives nice but its overpriced.\n\nAAPL is also overvalued at 35x earnings. Adding chatGPT to a smartphone and enhancing siri isn't worth the current valuation. The goggles were a bust. No new products on the horizon just same stuff just newer versions. Apple isn't the glamorous high growth tech company it once was. Iphones sales are falling off in China and this will definitely show in the next couple quarters of earnings. Its the Nike of tech stocks. People aren't spending $100 for shoes they certainly wont spend $900+ for a phone. I wouldn't be surprised if Buffet starts to offload shares at this PE ratio.\n\nThat fourth industrial revolution is not happening today or tomorrow, we are too early. This is going to take some time.\n\nI agree with Ken Griffin on this, the current AI products on the market are not the revolution many are hoping for, they're mediocre at best. There's too much spending and too much free products for this to add to any company's bottom line. The real winners are semi's, data storage and anything surrounding it.\n\n[https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/01/ken-griffin-says-hes-not-convinced-ai-will-replace-human-jobs-in-near-future.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/01/ken-griffin-says-hes-not-convinced-ai-will-replace-human-jobs-in-near-future.html)\n\nThere is one area that will benefit astronomically from AI but that will come a bit later.",

    "selftext": "I have been a lurker on WSB for some time *(ignore the account age)*, despite my lack of activity, and I\u2019ve noticed a recent uptick in posts discussing AI hype and how it\u2019s surely a bubble ready to pop. This is obviously due in large part to the recent NVDA explosion, but there\u2019s more to consider.\n\nWhile you guys spend most of your time focused on the money and investments side of AI, I spend my time focused on the technology itself \u2013 and the beliefs that seem to emanate from it.\n\nLet\u2019s look at NVDA. Right now, NVDA is making its mark on the world almost entirely due to its ability to produce and supply cutting edge GPUs for companies looking to fashion larger and larger clusters and have more compute than any reasonable person could possibly fathom. Surely, this ends at some point, right? Surely, the people in charge realize that they\u2019ve built large enough GPU clusters *(never mind the hundreds of billions recently committed to building the largest datacenters on the planet by the likes of Google and Microsoft)* and Jensen stops getting orders. Surely, this ends.\n\nA lot of people have been comparing AI hype to the dot com bubble of the early 2000s, which seems to be a fair comparison on a surface level. However, this misses something so fundamentally different about AI today that it almost entirely invalidates it.\n\nWhether you think AI is real or a scam or a stochastic parrot or whatever, the people in charge *(Sam Altman, Elon Musk, Bill Gates, Sundar Pichai, Tim Cook, etc)* believe 100% that this is one of the final pieces of technology mankind will ever create. They believe that the first company that creates AGI *(artificial general intelligence \u2013 typically defined as an AI that can do any task as well as the average person)* will be the first company to create ASI *(artificial superintelligence \u2013 typically defined as an AI that is smarter than every single living human being put together)* and will end up deciding the future. And they believe this is going to happen in ten to fifteen years.\n\nIf this seems silly to you, I don\u2019t blame you. Technology typically doesn\u2019t move especially fast or change too much over short amounts of time. It\u2019s not like a refrigerator purchased today is a wildly different beast than one purchased fifty years ago. Sure, it might be more efficient and have more room, but fundamentally it\u2019s the same technology.\n\nThis is how life has been ever since the industrial revolution: a new technology is invented, distributed, and then refined over the next 50 years until it basically asymptotes.\n\nThat is not what is happening with AI, and it isn\u2019t what is going to happen in the future. Progress is being made at a blistering rate. People who aren't constantly paying attention to every single development and published paper have no idea what's going on. They just wake up one day and go \"Oh wow look at that, AI can just make videos and music out of nowhere. This must be something that was developed overnight and is a magical thing that can only happen once or twice in my life. Any discussion about further development is silly and just hype!\"\n\nWhether you like it, believe it, or even choose to acknowledge it, AI isn\u2019t in a hype bubble this time. It\u2019s easy enough to look back at the last half-century and see AI\u2019s previous bubble bursts, but those were due in large part to the technology itself being substandard. It\u2019s hard to make ASI when your supercomputer has less computing power than the first iPhone in 2007. This is why today\u2019s companies are pouring what seems like an unreasonable and unjustifiable amount of money into buying GPUs \u2013 and why they will continue to. Everyone has realized that compute is all you need.\n\nWhether or not this ends up making \u201cgod in a box\u201d isn\u2019t especially important. What is important is that the companies trying to do it aren\u2019t going to stop anytime soon. The risk/reward on trying to build the final thing mankind will ever build is so astronomically skewed that it\u2019s hardly even a consideration. The reward for success is so vast that it makes the cost of failure *(a few hundred billion dollars)* seem insignificant.\n\nI\u2019m not trying to sell you on NVDA or MSFT or anything like that, I\u2019m just trying to let you know what\u2019s actually going on. You can\u2019t sit there and say \u201cI looked on the internet and saw a tech bubble from before I was born, that must mean this is the same thing!\u201d because that makes you wrong. You fundamentally misunderstand what\u2019s happening in tech right now if you think this is going to follow conventional patterns. This is a once in a lifetime event, and it might very well succeed.",

I figured I'd drop a DD post to help you all have some context around $NVDA's stock split that will go live on Monday & what has historically happened to Tech Co's after executing a stock split.\n\n**NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE.**\n\n**TL;DR - The $NVDA stock split is BEARISH given the historical performance of tech co. stock splits.**\u00a0Scroll to the bottom for positions\n\nLet's start by looking at a list of recent stock splits, how they performed over the next couple sessions:\n\nI. $AAPL 4 for 1 stock split announced on 7/30/20 (w/ earnings), went active on 8/28/20:\n\n* Performance after\u00a0**announcement**\u00a0of stock split to stock split actual date:\n   * Opened at $100.48/share on 7/31/20, closed at $122.11/share on 8/28/20 for a gain of +21.5%\n* AFTER STOCK SPLIT GOES LIVE PERFORMANCE: reference $122.11/share closing price\n   * 3-day: +5.3%\n   * 6-day: -9.6%\n   * Got to as low as $107.7/share within 1-month for a drawdown of -11.8% after stock split was announced before bouncing\n\nII. $AMZN 20 for 1 stock split announced 3/9/22, went active on 6/3/22:\n\n* AFTER STOCK SPLIT GOES LIVE PERFORMANCE: reference on 6/3/22 of $122.35/share closing price\n   * 3-day: -1.0%\n   * 6-day: -15.3%\n\nIII. $TSLA 3 for 1 stock split announced on 8/5/22, went active on 8/24/22 at close:\n\n* AFTER STOCK SPLIT GOES LIVE PERFORMANCE: reference on 8/24/22 of $297.10/share closing price\n   * 3-day: -4.1%\n   * 6-day: -6.7%\n\nIV. $NVDA 4 for 1 stock split announced on 5/21/21, went active on 7/20/21 (a rare bullish stock split):\n\n* AFTER STOCK SPLIT GOES LIVE PERFORMANCE: reference on 7/20/21 of $185.80/share closing price\n   * 3-day: +5.1%\n   * 6-day: +4.8%\n      * $NVDA actually was selling off prior to the stock split date here where it reached as high as $203.37/share before closing at the near-term bottom of $187.47/share (-7.8%) the day RIGHT before the stock split date (7/19/21)\n\nThere are many other examples like Tesla's 5 for 1 stock split on 8/28/20, $GOOG 20 for 1 stock split on 7/15/22, & others. I've compiled a database of tech company stock splits from $CSCO to $MSFT back to 1991 to obtain the following stats:\n\nAverage 3-day performance after a stock split:\u00a0***-0.8%***\n\n% of times negative 3-days:\u00a0***52.0%***\n\nAverage 6-day performance after a stock split:\u00a0***-3.4%***\n\n% of times negative 6-days:\u00a0***72.0%***\n\n*\\*\\*days measured as next 3/6 trading days, not calendar days*\n\n*---*\n\nI like my odds here on a bearish play on $NVDA following the stock split on Monday.\n\n**POSITIONS**: July 5 $1140P. If it gets to \\~$1000 (or $100/share split adjusted), my plan is to buy the dip.\n\nHappy tendie hunting you regards",

They are in the sweet spot of massive demand, sky high profit margins, and massive media attention combined with rock solid guidance. Will they hold the top spot forever? No, but who cares.

Where Gitlab might be at a disadvantage is storage, since I'm pretty sure Azure has the cheapest storage options around right now.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5989lla7k24d1.png?width=1554&format=png&auto=webp&s=4017e45ed52f5a39c1ff50ba3876396fb1833513",

    "selftext": "Someone recently posted their $BB yolo yesterday, and that piqued my interest again in the stock. Most people remember BB as the dominant cellphone of the 2000s before Steve Jobs and his pancreas released the iPhone. BB phones were practical, resilient, and most importantly *secure* for a device of that era.\n\nSo like a bitch in heat, I passionately purchased calls earlier today. But soon thereafter, buyer's regret took a hold of me after sifting through $BB 10-Ks and old DD. I compared some data between competitors, and **soon realized how much of a shitshow this stock currently is.**\n\n**2021: Bad - No offense to the guys that made $BB DD in the past, but it was all pure speculation, probably so that the highly esteemed** ***ritards*** **of WSB would buy their bags.**\n\n* Pros: Very high short interest, nice lemon squeezy; plus tons of business potential with their tech in the EV sectors, IOT, and Cybersecurity.\n* Cons: BB had practically no revenue growth; bad financials; an exciting deal with Amazon whittled away to nothing. \n\n**2024: Slightly less bad, still not worth buying without chance of short squeeze**\n\n* Pros: Less debt, stronger sales and resilience in cybersecurity; sales strategies starting to look promising; meme buzz\n* Cons: Flat revenue growth, difficult financials; **much less short interest, 8% so no squeeze likely**; customer dissatisfaction/stronger competition\n\n**Financial:** I created a spreadsheet to calculate data pulled manually from 10-Ks to compare past years numbers, but figured this would be too much to add to the post and frankly it's a lot of extra work than needed. I know most of you would just skip over the numbers.\n\nBB been spending tons in R&D in past years, and this has taken chunks of what would be juicy profits. Now in what seems like a move to gain interest from investors, they are making cost cuts to improve financials. This could mean falling behind in tech advantage to larger companies like MSFT.\n\n* Total revenue was up $853mil (2024) vs. $656mil (2023) from last year, but still down from 2020 and 2021\n* Net income (money that you take home) was negative 3 out of the 4 last years (due to very high operating expenses)\n\n|YEAR|2021|2022|2023|2024|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|**Net income**|**-$1.1bil**|**$12mil**|**-$130mil**|**-$734mil**|\n\n* Debt slashed by 45%, and traded for longer term repayment, but with higher interest rates.\n\n**Technology:** Competition in this sector is *ROUGH*... tons of different endpoint management and security products out there... including Microsoft, Cisco, and Google. Cybersecurity companies such as CrowdStrike, Palo Alto and IBM, make it difficult for BB to get their foot in the door. Not to mention there's tons of posts from actual IT/Security folk on reddit that have moved away or avoided using Cyclance, BB's security platform.\n\n[Why is Cylance doing so poorly Business Wise compared to Crowdstrike, Palo Alto, Microsoft etc. : ](https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/18o9ksn/why_is_cylance_doing_so_poorly_business_wise/)\n\n[Is Cylance I\u2019m still a thing in 2021+? : ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cylance/comments/kbj08e/is_cylance_im_still_a_thing_in_2021/)\n\n[Endpoint protection options : ](https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/ps2yeh/endpoint_protection_options/)\n\n**Buzz:** Only way in short term that BB price will drive up is if retail buys a fuck ton, and while the cheap price is appealing, the other meme stocks are more attractive.\n\nIn conclusion, I regret my financial decision to buy calls and hope this will help others make better decisions than me.\n\n# TL;DR: $BB is not worth your money unless you like pain.",

    "selftext": "Is anyone seeing this or is it just me. Are we talking about TSMC here or...\n\nMorgan Stanley analysts hiked their price target on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TW:2330) (NYSE:TSM) (TSMC), citing improved prospects for the world\u2019s biggest contract chipmaker from artificial intelligence-geared processors based on **Arm technology**.\u00a0\n\nTSMC\u2019s price target was raised to T$928.0 from T$860.0, while Morgan Stanley analysts also maintained their overweight rating on the stock.

    "selftext": "I think TSLA might be (or become) the American Honda. Good products, occasionally cool stuff - and a name everyone knows.\n\nI think TSLA will eventually be something like Honda. Tesla is American, born and supported in primarily in the US.\n\nHonda is a great company. They make lots of great products. Honda makes vehicles, cars, aircraft, motorcycles, boat motors, lawn mowers, and a Robot (ASIMO the humanoid robot) and a motor that competes well in Formula-1 racing. So, I see parallels to TSLA.\n\nTesla has great products: Vehicles, Solar and battery products, and charging. Eventually maybe taxis that drive themselves and/or a robot.\n\nThat said, adoption can be slow and competition is often stiff. Tesla will do a good job of competition, but I can't see where they have a monopoly or even close. Even if Cathie Wood bases her TSLA predictions on monopoly or near cornered market estimates.\n\nI read on this reddit and post reply here and there.\n\nI have small put options on both TSLA. I think the auto industry is headed for a slower clip in the near future.\n\nI maintain that TSLA will be priced like a car company with some tech in the mix. Like Honda, but with more automation. Clearly with the number of people being cut from the company management knows things are slowing down. My opinion leans on the P/E ratio. The S&P 500 P/E ratio has roughly been between 15 and 25 for the last 15 years. I think TSLA is headed for a 25-35 x P/E. It is where tech some companies which make things are sitting. AAPL 28x, MSFT 35x, GOOG 26x, META 26x, TM (Toyota) is at 10x, Honda is at about 9x or 10x. TSLA is a vehicle company right now. The charging stations are a real business that seems to have longevity. And I think down the road TSLA will have material products for automation. The automatons \u2013 cars and robots are neat, but having a real product for market seems way off. And TSLA won\u2019t be the only one.\n\nReal products to market have often been slow to Musk and TSLA. Musk said the Cybertruck would go into production in late 2021 back when the vehicle was revealed in 2019. A small number of deliveries were made in late 2023. This was 4 to 5 years after announced. It is clear that planned products do happen, but often years after announced.\n\nAs the markets where TSLA has products become more mature, the growth prospects for the company become smaller. Sure TSLA could release a windmill, robot, something closer to real FSD, or Model X that tweets various videos of things that happen while driving, but things look like TSLA is maturing. Right now things are pivoting to a more stable and mature TSLA. And with a new product maybe it gets into the 40s maybe even the 50s. But this good company looks like the stock is overvalued. For my investments, I see TSLA headed to a PE between 25 and 35. And I think its going to get there this year and stay in that range for a while. The market had it there a few weeks back, and not much has changed other than job cuts.",

    "title": "Why I'm getting AMZN calls for today's earnings",
    "selftext": "Amazon (AMZN) is scheduled to report its fiscal Q1 2024 results **today.** I expect amazon to do well today on both earnings and revenues, and I'll explain why here. The company outperformed the street expectations in the last quarter, with net revenues increasing by 14% to $170 billion. It was driven by a 13% rise in the North America and Amazon web services segments, followed by a 17% gain in the International division. We expect the first quarter result to follow the same trend. I also am anticipating Amazon will release a dividend like META and GOOG, which I'll go into a lot of detail later. \n\nLet's talk about AMZN's ride over the past few years\u2014it's been a bit of a roller coaster, especially when you stack it up against the S&P 500. Back in early 2021, AMZN was hovering around $165. Fast forward to now, and it's ticked up to about $180. Sounds decent, right? But hold up, because that's nothing compared to the S&P, which has shot up by roughly 35% in the same period.\n\nLooking at the yearly breakdown: AMZN only inched up by 2% in 2021, then took a massive 50% dive in 2022, but bounced back hard with an 81% surge in 2023. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 had its own drama but less extreme, posting a 27% gain in 2021, dropping 19% in 2022, and climbing back up by 24% in 2023.\n\nThe takeaway? While AMZN did outperform the S&P in 2023, it lagged behind in the previous years. And this isn't just an AMZN thing\u2014other big names in the Consumer Discretionary sector like TSLA, TM, and HD, and even tech giants like GOOG, MSFT, and AAPL have also found it tough to consistently beat the S&P, in both up and down markets. So, what's next for AMZN? Let's keep our eyes peeled for their upcoming earnings report.\n\n# Revenue Beat\n\nAmazon\u2019s revenues grew 12% y-o-y to $574.8 billion in FY2023. All major categories posted growth in the year \u2013 online stores (5%), physical stores (6%), third-party seller services (19%), subscription services (14%), advertising services (24%), and AWS (13%). We expect the same trend to continue in Q1. Overall, we forecast Amazon\u2019s revenues to touch $641.4 billion for the full-year 2024.\n\n# EPS Beat \n\nAmazon Q1 2024 adjusted earnings per share is expected to be $0.85 per Trefis analysis, 2% above the consensus estimate of $0.83. The adjusted net income increased from -$2.7 billion to $30.4 billion in FY 2023. It was primarily because of lower operating expenses as a % of revenues, higher revenues, and a significant jump in the total non-operating income from -$18.2 billion to $705 million. Notably, the non-operating income was down in 2022 due to a marketable equity securities valuation loss. Further, the same trend was witnessed in Q4 2023. We expect the Q1 results to be on similar lines. Overall, Amazon is likely to report an annual GAAP EPS of $4.12 and revenue per share of $61.48 for the full-year 2024.\n\n# Possible Dividend Announcement\n\nMeta threw out its first dividend this March, and Google's parent company Alphabet isn't far behind, announcing a 20 cent dividend set for mid-June. This leaves us wondering about Amazon\u2014when are they joining the dividend party?\n\nBy the numbers, it seems like it\u2019s about time Amazon starts giving back some quarterly cash to its shareholders. Over the last decade, Amazon has racked up a cool $90 billion in free cash flow. Out of that giant pot, it only used about $6 billion for share buybacks in 2022, which is roughly a 7% capital return.\n\nIn comparison, other trillion-dollar behemoths have been way more generous, returning about 75% of their free cash flow over the past year\u2014though most of that was through share repurchases rather than dividends. Together, these non-Amazon trillion-dollar companies generated around $323 billion in cash flow over the last year, paid out $38 billion in dividends, and snapped up about $240 billion in their own stock.\n\nFor Amazon, cash flow isn't the issue. Wall Street's looking at a projected free cash flow of about $62 billion for 2024, which is expected to jump to $82 billion by 2025, per Bloomberg. So, the big question remains: when will Amazon start sending some of that cash flow back to shareholders in the form of dividends? Let's stay tuned and see if they'll open up their wallet.\n\nBut what would this look like? If Amazon decided to payout 75% of its projected 2024 free cash flow, we're talking about a dividend yield of around 2.4%. That actually beats the average 2.2% yield from other dividend-paying companies in the S&P.\n\nThis 2.4% isn't just dividends\u2014it includes any buybacks Amazon might throw into the mix. To give you a benchmark, the total shareholder yield for S&P 500 dividend payers has been about 3.3% over the past year. With Amazon\u2019s hefty cash flow, it\u2019s looking more and more like they\u2019re due to start sharing the wealth.\n\nJust for context, consider a bit of history. Microsoft went public back in 1986, and it took them 17 years and a revenue climb from less than $200 million to $32 billion before they started paying dividends in 2003. Since then, Microsoft\u2019s sales have been growing at a steady 10% yearly, with around $28 in dividends per share dished out to date. Fast forward to 2024, Microsoft\u2019s expected to hit sales around $260 billion.\n\nAmazon, on the other hand, went public in 1997 and has exploded from $600 million to nearly $600 billion in annual sales. With projections showing a growth rate of about 12% over the next few years, Amazon is well-positioned to both fuel further growth and start paying dividends.\n\nCurrently, Microsoft\u2019s stock yields about 0.8%. If Amazon wanted to match this, they\u2019d need to allocate roughly 20% of their forecasted free cash flow for the next two years to dividends\u2014totally doable since S&P 500 dividend payers typically spend about half their free cash flow on dividends.\n\nBottom line: Amazon doesn\u2019t need to aim for a 0.8% yield right off the bat. Kicking things off with literally any dividend would be a solid move. And if they do so, the stock will PUMP. This is why I'm getting calls for earnings. A call spread would be good, for those who can't get a call spread, AMZN 5/3 190c @ 3.20 doesn't look too bad. I'm picking 190c because the stock has *on average* moved about 7% up or down with earnings. A 7% push up today would bring the stock to about 192ish. Not enough for the calls to profit, so getting a call spread is deal. To do this, I'll just sell the 200c @ 1.19. So the cost of the whole position becomes 2.01/share. Not too bad. Good luck guys.",

This move essentially signals confidence in MSFT's continued collaboration with OpenAI and AI-driven growth and presumably means that they'll use MSFT products like Azure for their cloud compute. This happened afterhours yesterday, and moved the stock 2%.  MSFT has moved back slightly, not so interested in this unless we have a huge surge of volume off the open.\n\n[**OPEN (OpenDoor)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=OPEN&p=d) \\- Stock price has gone gangbusters since the appointment of Kaz Nejatian, Shopify\u2019s former COO, as the new CEO. We moved from 6->10 in the past 2 days, not interested in a long, maybe a short if the stock price goes parabolic to something like 15/20. Stock is pretty liquid (millions of shares every minute) so no concern with getting size if needed. It's also a meme stock, so we'll see how this turns out.\n\n[**ORCL (Oracle)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=ORCL&p=d) \\- ORCL is selling off after one of the craziest earnings moves I've ever seen, but it's retraced back significantly from the $345 high. Mainly interested in the $300 and what that looks like if we reach it. Need to assess what the box looks like at that price.\n\n**IPOs Today:** [**GEMI**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=GEMI&p=d)",

    "selftext": "The question has to be asked, who is funding OpenAI moving forward? \n\n$300 billion to Oracle. Projected cash burn through 2029 is $115 billion (as of a few days ago). And now this comes out:   OPENAI, NVIDIA TO ANNOUNCE BILLIONS IN UK DATA CENTER PROJECTS\n\nSo that lands them in the realm of needing maybe $500+ billion in the next 4 years? They don\u2019t make money, they burn money, so it\u2019s not coming out of pocket. Maybe they go public and aim for a 1 trillion starting valuation? I know there are changes with their MSFT deal happening right now, not sure if listing is on the table. Or is the US government just giving them a blank check? None of these options seem overly likely.\n\n$ wise none of this adds up, and it\u2019s really starting to look like a giant scam to me. Yes ai has great uses, yes it is not going anywhere. But it\u2019s also not profitable, at all. Not even close. All of the mega caps are burning huge amounts of money getting this all set up, with the plan to monetize it down the road. META had its panic moment when they started overpaying to poach talent, probably because they realized that llm\u2019s hit a wall that would result in ai not being as profitable as projected. \n\nI think we may be in the stage where all companies start lying about future capex and revenue streams. At this point they have to. Just look at NVDA, renting back its own products lol, clever, but not actually a good thing. \n\nIf the mega caps admit they need to scale back the ai roll out or drastically extend the timelines to complete these data center projects, then bye bye stock price. But it is hard for public companies to just straight up lie. OpenAI has less public eyeballs on their books. Can they really afford all of this? They are saying they can, and ORCL had an amazing day thanks to that. So maybe that is the play now. As the music gets closer to stopping, we will see more and more projects get announced from OpenAI and possibly some of the other non-publicly traded ai companies. \n\nThese lies buy the industry time, which will allow the publicly traded companies to do offerings, maybe sell some stock, and just generally prepare for the coming market downturn. In turn, they agree to support the companies that are helping them fake these expansion / future revenue numbers right now. Because when the ball drops, and the capex bonfire is still burning hot, it\u2019s going to get ugly. \n\nWhen will this finally fall apart? Who knows. Maybe 3 months. Maybe 1 year. Maybe 2 years if the government drops rates to zero and hands out blank checks to all ai companies. But it will hit, and it won\u2019t be pretty. The warning signs are already showing. ",

    "title": "CENTENE (CNC) is a good long term opportunity at this level",
    "selftext": "Like every self-respecting Value investor, I've been looking for opportunities to divest from my tech-heavy portfolio. AI Stocks like NVDA, PLTR, MSFT, AMZN, TSLA have done great, but some of these valuations just don't make sense and I don't think now is a good time to buy into them anymore.\n\nThat brings me to look for other opportunities. I don't think there's a better opportunity right now than the Healthcare sector.\n\nHistorically, Healthcare has outperformed the S&P, thanks to relatively stable stocks like CNC.\n\nLet's take a step back. What the f\\*%# happened to this stock in the past 2 months ?\n\nThey came out and :\n\n1. Said that their Medical Loss Ratio(MLR) will be much higher because claims are getting expensive\n2. Pulled guidance for 2025\n\nSince then, they've had their Q2 Earnings call. They've revised guidance to a EPS of 1.75 for 2025 (from 7.5 previously, ouch). Given that their Q1 2025 EPS was 2.9, and their Q2 EPS was -0.16, this is pricing in a combined -1$ EPS for Q3 and Q4.\n\nThe bar is very low. Even a small sign of life from the CEO, could send this stock easily back to the 40 - 50 range, as a path to profitability is starting to be priced into the stock.\n\nThe recent headwind, albeit very impactful in the short to medium-term, is temporary. the CEO has said that they have already completed rate re-filings in the 29 states by now, and that the rate decision for each states will be expected in September. The new rates that determine the amount of premiums received, will take into account the high cost for behavioral health(therapists, psychiatric meds etc...),  home health services, and expensive drugs (Wegovy, Ozempic...) .\n\nCompared to the giant UNH, CNC has a much better reputation, isn't under DOJ Investigation, and Ambetter, their Health Insurance Marketplace, has a claims denial rate of 14%, more than half that of UNH.\n\n# Path back to profitability :\n\nCEO and the team are now laser focused on restoring profitability by pulling the necessary levers :\n\n\\- identifying and reducing areas where claims have been too \"costly\"\n\n\\- increasing premium rates, to account for the challenging environment, and with a worst case scenario in mind (continued high morbidity and utilization rate)\n\n\\- hinting at a stock buyback in the Earnings call\n\n\\- Immune from tariff BS and TACO\n\n# Possible risks\n\n\\- The trend of high morbidity and drug use continues to escalate, leading to more people needing expensive surgeries and drugs ==> unlikely, as people who fear that their benefits are being taken away with OBBBA, have already stocked up on drugs/done surgeries\n\n\\- continued political pressure on healthcare costs with bills like the OBBBA ==> unlikely, as this bill seems to be a one-and-done on healthcare, and now the Administration will focus on other more pressing matters (Russia - Ukraine conflict, Inflation, crypto, tax bills for the rich etc ...).\n\nAlso, this is speculation, but I think the full impact of the OBBBA are wayyy overstated. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that by 2034, 16 million people will lose coverage, but that's a decade away. This will be accounted for in the rate re-pricing.\n\n\\- Risks of people changing Insurers because of higher rates ==> given that every Health insurer will be increasing rates, among them: Elevance, UNH, Molina, Blue Cross Blue Shield, CNC will be no exception. People won't switch because none of the other options are better. Centene's health plan is pretty competitive, and compared to Molina health who's the most affordable, Centene's has much better coverage(available across 29 states vs 8 for Molina)\n\nOverall, I think this is a compelling buy, not just for CNC, but for the Health care sector overall, as the benefits greatly outweigh the risk at this point. Historically, the Healthcare Sector has outperformed the S&P, and this is the perfect time to buy in.",

    "selftext": "Okay guys, so Amazon is set to release its Q2 earnings after the market closes today with an analyst call at 5 pm. This is gonna be a big one. Did anyone catch META yesterday? Fuck. \n\nFor Amazon, analysts expect revenue around $162 billion (up 10%) and EPS between $1.32 and $1.33, with operating income projected at $16.7 to $16.87 billion. And during this sesh, the key areas to watch will include AWS growth (estimated at $30.77 billion, up 17%), AI investments (over $100 billion capex planned), and advertising revenue (up 17% to $14.99 billion). Considering the stock performance, it's up 5% year-to-date, with bullish analyst sentiments (e.g., UBS raised price target to $271), but some valuation concerns exist (GF Value at $189.47). External factors like tariffs and Prime Day success could influence outcomes, with potential for significant stock movement based on guidance. I know that people are going to be playing AMZN earnings so I wanted to do a little write up for /r/Stocks so you guys are well informed. And I'll even post what I plan on getting at the end. \n\n**Analyst Expectations and Financial Projections**\n\nAnalysts have provided a range of estimates for Amazon's Q2 performance, showing a lot of optimism. \n\nRevenue: Expected to be around $162 billion, with variations such as $162.1 billion and $162.19 billion, representing a 9.5% to 10% year-over-year increase.  \n\nEarnings Per Share (EPS): Forecasted at $1.32 to $1.33, up from $1.26 last year, with Amazon having beaten EPS estimates for nine consecutive quarters.  \n\nOperating Income: Projected between $16.7 billion and $16.87 billion, a 13.8% to 15% increase, with an operating margin expected at 10.6% (up from 9.9% last year).  \n\nThese projections suggest strong growth, and I honestly think Amazon can exceed these figures and provide robust forward guidance. Especially given its historical \"beat and raise\" pattern, which may not suffice in the current up cycle.\n\n**Key Business Segments and Growth Drivers**\n\nAmazon's diverse operations are expected to drive its Q2 results, with several segments highlighted as critical:  \n\n1) AWS (Amazon Web Services)  \n\nAWS remains a cornerstone of Amazon's profitability, with Q1 2025 revenue up 17% to $29.3 billion. For Q2, net sales are estimated at $30.77 billion, with growth of 17% excluding foreign exchange effects. However, operating margins are expected to drop to 35% due to significant investments in AI and infrastructure, part of a $100+ billion capex plan for 2025. This segment contributed 17% of revenue and 58% of operating income last year, making it a focal point for me.\n\n2) Advertising Revenue  \n\nAdvertising is another growth engine, with Q1 2025 revenue up 18%. For Q2, it's projected to rise 17% to $14.99 billion, reflecting increased monetization of Amazon's platform as more businesses leverage its advertising ecosystem.\n\n3) Prime Membership  \n\nPrime membership grew 9% year-over-year to 220 million globally, providing a stable revenue stream through subscription fees. This growth, driven by benefits like free shipping and streaming, is expected to continue supporting Amazon's financials.\n\n4) Operational Efficiency  \n\nAmazon has improved operational efficiency, reducing fulfillment costs and increasing delivery speeds, which should enhance margins. These efforts are part of a broader strategy to balance growth investments with profitability.\n\n5) Investments in AI and Other Areas  \n\nAmazon's commitment to AI is a major theme, with a $100+ billion capital expenditure plan for 2025, primarily focused on AWS and AI services. This includes developing proprietary chips like Trainium2 and partnering with Nvidia to enhance AI capabilities. While these investments may pressure short-term margins, they position Amazon for long-term growth in the expanding AI market. Additionally, Project Kuiper, a satellite initiative, is noted as an area of rising expense, alongside e-commerce and content/advertising investments.\n\n**Analyst sentiments are generally bullish**\n\nUBS raised its price target from $249 to $271, calling Amazon the \"most coiled\" Big Tech name, implying an 18% upside and highlighting extensive investments across e-commerce, AWS, content/advertising, and Kuiper. Other analysts, including Wedbush, William Blair, and Stifel, reiterated \"outperform\" or \"buy\" ratings, with an average price target of $252.66 (range: $195 to $305). \n\n**External Factors and Market Context**\n\nSeveral external factors could influence Amazon's earnings and stock reaction:  \n\nConsider the Tariffs. Earlier this year, tariff concerns, particularly on Chinese goods, weighed on the stock, but recovery followed eased U.S. tariffs. Analysts are parsing impacts on e-commerce, with Amazon benefiting from stockpiling ahead of potential tariff hikes.\n\nAlso, think about the Prime Day Success. Held in July, Prime Day's performance could lift revenue guidance for the September-ending quarter, providing a positive signal for us.  \n\nAnd finally, with any earnings post, we need to consider macroeconomic events such as inflation, interest rates, and consumer spending trends could affect retail sales, particularly in online stores and third-party seller revenue, expected to grow 6.5% to $58.99 billion and 7% to $38.74 billion, respectively.\n\n**Potential Catalysts**\n\nI'm expecting accelerating AWS growth, better-than-expected margins, new AI announcements, and strong Q3 guidance. UBS expects upward revisions to operating profit and free-cash-flow as revenue grows, potentially more dramatic than peers.  \n\n\n**Comparisons**\n\nMicrosoft's recent Q2 results, where cloud growth was a significant driver, boosts my confidence in Amazon's cloud business, with MSFT stock jumping 4.47% in after-hours trading. This really does show how important AWS performance will be, as Amazon faces a high bar following Microsoft's strong showing.\n\n**So what to do?**\n\nAmazon's Q2 earnings are poised to be a major event, with strong growth expected across key segments like AWS, advertising, and Prime, supported by significant AI investments. This will be a great opportunity to get a call spread. For those who don't know anything about option trading, you don't need to continue reading. But for those who do, I'll be buying the 8/1 245c (@ 2.67) and selling the 252.5c (@ 1.11). This means I can get the spread for $156, with a potential max gain of 4.8x if AMZN can go up about 7.8% with earnings. Considering the stock moves on average about \u00b18% with earnings, there's a good chance it'll go up 4-8% today. \n\nNext week tho, we have a ton more earnings so I think I'll be doing a post on PLTR and AMD.",

It would seem to me, their investment in OpenAI and Azure will be big for the AI industry moving forward, but there is the risk that AI doesn't find the profitability compared to spending people think it will. They clearly have the money to buy smaller players, and are still an industry leader for a reason.\n\nRight now, I have positions in SNOW and GOOGL for cloud. Do you guys have any pure cloud plays that you are hot on right now?",

    "selftext": "With the recent macro situation, this could have a knock-on effect on equities and risk assets:\n\nThis morning, the EURUSD fell to its lowest since early July and is currently hovering around 1.0800. That's not a small drop, and a few days ago we were near the top of 1.09.\n\nThere are probably a few reasons at the heart of this decline: \n\nUS economic data was too strong \n\nQ2 GDP was revised upwards to 2.8% (previously 2.3%).\n\nCore PCE (the Fed's most watched inflation indicator) was higher than expected.\n\nThese data strengthened the market's expectations that the Fed will \u201ckeep interest rates high for longer\u201d and made the dollar stronger.\n\nECB releases dovish signals \n\nEurozone inflation data showed some easing.\n\nGermany's latest PMI data is very weak, recession fears are rising again.\n\nSome ECB officials are starting to sound cautious, and the market expects that rate cuts could start in early 2026 (and there are even suggestions that they could be possible by the end of 2025).\n\nSafe-haven capital is pouring into the dollar \n\nGeopolitical situations are heating up (e.g. Ukraine, global trade tensions), allowing the dollar to attract a lot of capital as a safe-haven asset.\n\nMeanwhile, U.S. bond yields remain firm 10-year U.S. bonds are close to 4.3%.\n\nWhat does this mean for the markets?\n\nLarge tech stocks and those companies that are heavily influenced by the dollar (e.g., $AAPL, $MSFT, $META) could be under pressure, especially since a good portion of their revenue comes from Europe.\n\nMultinationals (e.g., $PG, $KO, $JNJ) could take a loss in Q3 earnings due to exchange rate losses.\n\nEurozone stocks (which can be followed via the $EZU or $FEZ ETFs) could be pressured by economic weakness, but a weak euro favors German exporters, such as automakers.\n\nDollar-denominated commodities (e.g., gold, crude oil) could come under pressure in the short term due to a stronger dollar, unless macro risks push up safe-haven demand, such as gold.\n\nMy take?\n\nShort-term weakness in the euro is justified, but the next thing to watch is whether US inflation continues to \u201cstick\u201d, and the Fed's attitude at its annual meeting in Jackson Hole at the end of August. If Powell is hawkish again, we could see EUR/USD fall to 1.07 or even 1.06.\n\nIs anyone hedging their exchange rate risk with forex manipulation, long DXY (dollar index) options, or in company earnings reports? Would love to hear how people are laying it out.",

Today's pre-market index gains, especially in Nasdaq futures, reflect the market's expectations for tech stocks. Here are four stock moves I'm watching:\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udd39 Microsoft (MSFT): down 0.3% premarket as SharePoint software was revealed to be under \u201cactive attack\u201d. The software is widely used within government and business. Microsoft has issued a security patch, but the incident may have a short-term impact on customer confidence.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udd39 Verizon (VZ): Shares up 4.6% premarket after Q2 results beat estimates and raised the lower end of its full-year profit estimate range to 1%-3%. Strong wireless service revenue growth and healthy customer base expansion. Adjusted EPS of $1.22 beat estimates.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udd39 Alaska Airlines (ALK): up 0.9% premarket. Operations have now resumed despite a nationwide flight suspension due to an IT outage. Both the company and its subsidiaries have suffered recent cybersecurity incidents, which may prompt them to step up their IT investments in the future.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udd39 Equinix (EQIX): 2.5% pre-market gain after activist investor Elliott adds stake. Elliott has reportedly become one of the top 10 shareholders in EQIX. The company is a data center REIT with potential long-term upside in AI data processing needs.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udcca Personal view:\n\n\n\nFor Microsoft, this security incident may be a stock price disruptor in the short term, but the long term still needs to look at its cloud services and AI deployment capabilities.\n\n\n\nVerizon's fundamentals are solid and its valuation remains attractive, especially against the backdrop of a high dividend yield.\n\n\n\nStructural revaluation opportunities may exist in EQIX if it continues to get a boost from activist investors.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udcac Position Disclosure: There are currently no positions in any of the above stocks; consider taking a position in EQIX or VZ in the coming week.",

Oracle's free cash flow could increase by $3.3 billion, or $1.12 per share.\n\nMateen said, \"The average return for software companies that pay cash taxes is about 9%, largely due to more favourable R&D treatment ...... It's also worth noting that these are tax accounting changes, not financial accounting, and are largely based on the fact that tax benefits related to R&D and bonus depreciation are being brought forward .\"\n\nThe bill includes the reinstatement of domestic R&D expensing. In addition, the bill provides for a 100 per cent rebate of bonus depreciation for qualified capital expenditures placed in service between 2025 and 2029.\n\nEvercore noted, \u2018The net impact is an additional 80% cash tax savings on 2025 R&D expenses.\u2019 \"On the capital expenditure side, \u201cbonus depreciation\u201d on capital expenditure is gradually reduced from 2022 onwards, meaning that by 2025, 40 per cent of capital expenditure is immediately deductible for cash tax purposes, with the remaining 60 per cent amortised over the useful life of the asset. As a result of OBBB, all capital expenditures will receive 100 per cent \u201cbonus depreciation\u201d in the first year.\"\n\nMicrosoft and Oracle are among the software companies benefiting from high capital expenditures. evercore estimates that the companies will spend $69.7 billion and $23.6 billion on capital expenditures in 2025. Much of this capex is related to artificial intelligence and data centre construction.\n\nEvercore rates Microsoft Outperform and raised its price target to $515 from $500. Oracle is also rated Outperform and its price target was raised to $215 from $180.\n\nAdditionally, Evercore expects investment in artificial intelligence and the technology sector in general to increase as companies in a variety of industries reap the benefits.",

    "selftext": "Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)-backed OpenAI has no active plans to use Alphabet unit Google's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) tensor processing units, or TPUs, the company said following media reports that the AI startup was planning to use rival Google's chips to meet growing demand, Reuters reported.\n\nA spokesperson for OpenAI told the news agency that OpenAI is in early testing with some of Google's TPUs, but it has no plans to deploy them at scale right now, the report added.\n\nOpenAI is actively using Nvidia's graphics processing units, or GPUs, and AMD's (NASDAQ:AMD) AI chips to power its growing demand, the report noted.\n\nA potential deal for Google's TPUs could have marked a supplier diversification for OpenAI, which has relied on Nvidia's (NASDAQ:NVDA) chips in the past to train its AI models and for inference computing. On Monday, analysts from Morgan Stanley said in a research note that potential usage of Google's chips for inferencing OpenAI's AI workloads would have been a significant endorsement of Google's hardware.\n\nOver the weekend, it was reported that OpenAI has started using Google-made AI chips to build its products. However, it was noted that Google was not providing the most powerful TPUs to OpenAI, signaling its plans to use its most advanced versions to power the company's internal projects, including its own large language model Gemini.\n\nLast month, OpenAI, reportedly, signed a deal with Google Cloud for the AI company's computing needs.",

Pension funds in turn will lessen in influx of capital, so they have less to invest. The circle gets worse and worse. \n\nI've heard many-a-person tell me: \"Remember the internet? Remember how many people said jobs would be lost because of that, and how they came back?\", but my biggest question is this: What will the job landscape look like around the world if AI is killing everything around it? \n\nDo we expect college-aged kids to go and work in the cornfields and do cleaning jobs because they can't find work after leaving college. More's the case, we're also going to see unpaid student debt rise beyond all measure....and the death of many-a-college.\n\nThe other side of it is that there will be a limit to how much can be cut, and unions stop AI killing every job in the world, leading to a more socialist world but one that sees more people employed. \n\nOr am I missing something?",

    "selftext": "As we head into the final week of June,\u00a0**Qualcomm**\u00a0continues to test investors\u2019 patience. Even with a fundamentally solid earnings report in April and a tidy 25% gains since then, the tech giant is failing to ignite the kind of sustained uptrend seen in bigger peers like\u00a0**NVIDIA**\u00a0or\u00a0**Broadcom**. Shares have been drifting downwards for nearly two weeks, though Monday\u2019s 1% gain showed some welcome strength. The uptrend that began in April is technically still intact, but only just.\n\nThis lack of momentum has been especially frustrating given Qualcomm\u2019s healthy diversification across handsets, automotive, and the Internet of Things (IoT), not to mention its recent M&A activity.\n\nAnd yet, analyst coverage has been sparse in comparison to other major chipmakers. That\u2019s why last week\u2019s update from Bank of America can\u2019t be ignored.\n\n# Bank of America Sees at Least 30% Upside\n\nBank of America\u2019s research team, led by Tal Liani,reiterated its Buy rating on Qualcomm, though it trimmed its price target from $245 to $200. It\u2019s a noteworthy move, while they\u2019ve tempered expectations, they still see roughly 30% upside from where the stock closed on Monday.\n\nTheir reasoning was clear. As we mentioned above, Qualcomm\u2019s Q2 earnings were solid, with the numbers coming in ahead of analyst expectations pretty much across the board. Its QCT segment, which includes the company\u2019s core chip business, and its Handsets did especially well, while Automotive and IOT were both impressive too.\n\n# Potential Headwinds for Qualcomm\n\nThe problem, though, according to Bank of America, is that some of its sales trends are showing signs of stagnation. As\u00a0**Apple** , one of Qualcomm\u2019s key customers, continues to bring more and more of its manufacturing in-house, Bank of America now expects its contribution to headset sales to fall sharply and potentially disappear altogether. That\u2019s a huge headwind for a company still heavily dependent on smartphone cycles.\n\nStill, they believe Qualcomm\u2019s AI PCs and data center growth can offset some of the drag, though the company is lacking any near-term catalysts that could spark renewed bullishness. All that being said, however, their updated $200 target reflects a 15x multiple on their 2026 earnings estimate, which keeps Qualcomm looking extremely cheap relative to the sector. The stock\u2019s current forward P/E sits below 14, in stark contrast to NVIDIA\u2019s 46.\n\nThese risks aren\u2019t new, but taken together, they help explain why the stock has struggled to build lasting momentum. The Bank of America team could easily have downgraded the stock to a Hold, but they didn\u2019t, and investors should take confidence from that.\n\nAnd with the stock trading at a highly unusual discount to its peers from a valuation standpoint, you can\u2019t help but feel there\u2019s a bargain to be had here - you might just have to wait a little longer than is ideal for the payoff.\n\n# Watch the Chart\n\nFrom a technical standpoint, Qualcomm is approaching an inflection point. Last week\u2019s update would have helped spur some bullish interest, but the stock has been effectively trending down for the past fortnight. Crucially, the MACD just completed a bearish crossover, and momentum could turn negative if shares don\u2019t start rallying north soon.\n\nGiven the\u00a0S&P 500 index\u00a0is on the verge of an all-time record close, bulls will want to see Qualcomm move back towards $160 this week, which would mean it avoids setting a lower low and risking a breakdown of the uptrend.\n\nAs AI and edge computing continue to drive long-term demand, stocks like QCOM, AVGO, MAAS, MSFT, MU, and TXN could benefit from renewed infrastructure and device-side innovation, especially in areas like IoT and automotive connectivity.\n\nFor investors willing to stomach some near-term volatility, Qualcomm offers an intriguing mix of value, optionality, and a long-term AI tailwind. The latest analyst commentary should serve as a reminder that while the potential mightn\u2019t be as bright as some others out there, it\u2019s far from lost. But unless shares can shake off the lethargy and recapture momentum soon, it may take another upside surprise to get the stock firing again.",

Thune and Senate leadership basically shrugged him off. They\u2019re pushing this thing through  and fast\n\nHere\u2019s where it gets interesting from a market angle:\n\nThey're talking about cutting back the $40K SALT deduction to save money. But whatever they save might immediately get canceled out because there's also strong pressure to make temporary business tax breaks permanent  stuff like R&D deductions, bonus depreciation, and interest expensing\n\nThat\u2019s a huge deal if you're long big-cap tech, industrials, or healthcare. These tax breaks boost reported earnings pretty directly. If they go permanent, EPS estimates probably move higher without companies having to do anything operationally. Think MSFT, LMT, UNH  names like that\n\nBut here\u2019s the tradeoff: the bill\u2019s already inflationary. If they don\u2019t pay for it, bond yields are going to feel it. So while stocks might get an earnings tailwind, valuations could stay capped or even compress further if the 10Y starts creeping above 5% again\n\nAnd the AI provision buried in the bill? Wild. Originally it said states couldn\u2019t regulate AI for 10 years \u2014 a total federal preemption. Now they\u2019re walking that back to a softer \u201cyou lose broadband funding if you pass certain laws\u201d version. Doesn\u2019t matter much fiscally, but for megacaps like NVDA and GOOG, this is one less regulatory headache. The moat just got a little deeper\n\nOne curveball that could raise the cost: Section 899. It lets the president slap taxes on foreign countries seen as \"discriminatory.\" Some senators want to remove it, which could limit future revenue and geopolitical leverage. Not a today problem, but if you're watching defense and energy stocks tied to foreign trade, it matters\n\nAnd now there's infighting about Medicaid cuts. Josh Hawley\u2019s out here writing NYT op-eds saying this bill punishes working-class voters while handing corporate tax cuts. He\u2019s not totally wrong. If the GOP starts shifting back toward economic populism, how long do these business-friendly tax policies actually last?\n\nSo here\u2019s the real market question buried in all this: Are we about to get an earnings boost that the bond market completely wipes out?Because if you\u2019re buying the earnings upgrade but ignoring the debt story  you might be trading the right trend with the wrong multiple",

    "selftext": "Alright, looked into **CoreWeave (CRWV)**. It's an \"AI Hyperscaler\".. gives GPU (Nvidia) for AI stuff. Stock went nuts since IPO (like 300% up) \u00a0\n\n**Quick Take:** CRWV: Big AI growth, Nvidia likes them. BUT huge debt, only 2 big clients (MSFT, OpenAI), and weird deals with Nvidia & Applied Digital where they invest in each other.\n\n**The Good:**\n\n* **AI Demand:** Selling GPU power for AI. Revenue shot up: $229M (2023) to maybe $8B (2025 est).Q1 2025 rev $981.6M, +420% YoY.\u00a0\n* **Nvidia Favored?** Gets Nvidia's new GPUs (GB200s) early. Nvidia invested, owns \\~7%.\u00a0\n* **Huge Contracts:** $10B Microsoft deal (MSFT is 72% of Q1 rev!).\\~$16B from OpenAI.\u00a0\n* **Stock Surge:** Stock jumped big after IPO from AI hype & news.\u00a0\n\n**The Bad:**\n\n* **Massive Debt:** Over $12.7B raised (equity/debt) by end 2024, liabilities >$18.8B Q1 2025. Interest could be $2B+/year.S-1 said \"material weaknesses in internal control\". Not great. \u00a0\n* **No Profit:** Big revenue, still big losses. Net loss $863M (2024), $314.6M (Q1 2025).\u00a0\n* **Few Customers:** MSFT is 72% of revenue. OpenAI other main one. Risky. \u00a0\n* **Nvidia Reliance:** All GPUs from Nvidia. If Nvidia has issues, CRWV does too. \u00a0\n\n**The Weird Loops:**\n\n* **Nvidia:**\n   * Nvidia investor (\\~7% stake).\u00a0\n   * CRWV buys all GPUs from Nvidia. So NVDA invests, CRWV buys NVDA chips. \u00a0\n   * NVDA *did* pay CRWV for services ($320M deal 2023).Now NVDA says not a customer, and Q1 rev from them <10%. So NVDA invests -> CRWV buys NVDA GPUs -> NVDA *used to* pay CRWV. Circular. \u00a0\n* **Applied Digital (APLD):**\n   * CRWV has \\~$7B, 15yr lease deal with APLD for data centers.\u00a0\n   * CRWV also has warrants for \\~5.5% of APLD. So CRWV is big APLD customer AND investor. \u00a0\n\n**So?**\n\nIs CRWV a smart play with AI giants, or a debt bomb waiting to go off if partners, debt, or AI hype fails? They're racing to make cash from contracts to pay debt & upgrade GPUs before tech gets old.\u00a0\n\nWhat u think? Big win or big fail?\n\n*(NFA, my summary, do ur own DD.)*",

But for a company that is firing on so many cylinders, I\u2019m sanguine about the Q1-FY2026 results, and am absolutely positive about the long-term prospects \u2013 it\u2019s business as usual for the best of the best. This is a once-in-a-lifetime**\u00a0opportunity, and for once it\u2019s not a cliche.\n\nThe momentum around inferencing, and the computing power needs for inferencing and reasoning models suggest that Nvidia\u2019s is a supply problem \u2013 and even if the $ 200 Bn revenue estimate for FY Jan 2026 is off by a small percent, FY 2027 to FY 2030, will more than make up for it.\u00a0\n\nMorgan Stanley\u2019s Joseph Moore, who has an Overweight rating and $160 price target on Nvidia, said the Jensen Huang-led company is likely to be fine if it can show investors that rack supply has accelerated.\n\n**\u201cOur data points would suggest that in recent weeks, the full year rack forecasts have started to be revised upwards by 50 %+,\u201d Moore added, citing recent channel checks that suggest the issues have been resolved and are now starting to show up in numbers.**\n\n**Additionally, investors appear to be underestimating the \u201cunprecedented explosive token growth\u201d commentary coming from Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN) and Google (GOOG) (GOOGL), Moore posited.**\n\n**\u201cEvery hyperscaler has reported unanticipated strong token growth,\u201d Moore explained. \u201cBut our conviction is not driven by that, it\u2019s driven by the fact that literally everyone we talk to in the space is telling us that they have been surprised by inference demand, and there is a scramble to add GPUs.\u201d**\n\nMoore continued: \u201cThis is not driven by the limitless aspirations for training megaclusters fueled by highly speculative venture capitalists;\u00a0**this is proof that the models are being used, and driving revenue,**\u00a0which mitigates the biggest overhang on NVIDIA stock that this is all driven by venture funding that will dry up.\u00a0**The strength we highlight here is driven by usage, by the revenue-generating part of the business, and provides proof points that the scaling of inference as we move to reasoning-oriented models is a real thing.**\u00a0We are seeing this spanning geographies, as well, so published concerns about China having stockpiled H20s seem inaccurate.\u201d\n\n**I think Nvidia will have a similar overwhelming market share and growth in inference GPUs and their 1 year product roadmap ensures that they remain ahead of the competition\u2013 this is just the beginning.**",

    "selftext": "I know this may contradict prevailing sentiment but I hope you can at least hear me out. I\u2019ve been buying the tariff dip on margin, with $1.4 million invested in blue chip stocks. I\u2019m up 46% in the past month. My largest buys have been in TSM, NVDA, ORCL, CAVA, AMZN, MSFT, META & SMH.\n\n1. Largest tax cut in history is coming. Republicans own the house and senate, and Trump is deadset on cutting taxes by $5 trillion. Obviously not good for the national debt but that will juice the economy big time. \n\n2. Midterms are coming in 2026, and Trump will not want to have a recession on his hands which would risk him loosing the house and senate. I am fully convinced he launched this tariff war so early on, so he could get it over with before midterms. Trump has pivoted extremely quickly on all reciprocal tariffs aside from china. And he is desperate to start negotiations with china. China and the U.S have both entered a de escalatatory tone, with both sides  making exemptions to tariffs, china expressing willingness to deal with fentanyl, and acknowledging the desire to negotiate- along side acknowledging that the U.S has reached out to them. They are BOTH eager to water down these tariffs and deep down, when both parties want the same thing (reduced tariffs) they will find a way to get it despite all the public bluster. Even if a deal could take months, they will likely have a pause either during or before negotiations. \n\n\n3. Rate cuts are coming later this year. It\u2019s likely there will be at least 2 rate cuts before year\u2019s end assuming tariff inflation does not cause extreme inflation. Rate cuts will boost the ability to borrow capital, increase liquidity and stimulating the economy. \n\n4. We are at the dawn of the largest productivity revolution in history. Everyone has seemed to forget about AI despite big tech earnings and guidance blowing it out of the park. MSFT, GOOG, and META are printing money, and AI is showing incredible returns in the semiconductor and data center space. We are still in the early stages of AI, the smarter it gets the more productivity will increase. \n\n5. The economy is currently strong. Jobs numbers in April (not a lagging indicator) were impressive. At the end of the day, so long as people are not losing their jobs the U.S consumer will stay resilient. Tariff effects could disrupt that if they stay in effect long term. However I think it\u2019s pretty obvious the worst of the tariffs are temporary. \n\n6. U.S exceptionalism is nowhere close to ending. We are miles ahead of every other economy in terms of innovation and technology. We lead in services, and nobody is boycotting GOOG, META, MSFT etc in a significant way. These innovative tech companies exist nowhere else in scale and success. Our consumer is 30% of the global economy and nowhere do they have such a wealthy large pool of consumers. We are still the world reserve currency with 59% of currency held abroad is dollars. And nobody, even Trump will let us lose that reserve currency status.",

This news initially broke overnight yesterday and the stock saw a 6 point drop. I personally had the bias that it would actually be bullish for the company, so I'll likely trade a second move rather than the first if I'm at the computer for the trade. Moved down to around 270 overnight, will watch for additional confirmation. As most of you know, Musk's political involvement has made him controversial, and by extension, TSLA as well.\n\n[**RBLX (Roblox)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=RBLX&p=d)\\- Reported Q1 results with a loss of $0.32 per share vs. $0.40 expected and bookings of $1.21B vs. $1.14B expected. Raised 2025 bookings guidance to $5.285B\u2013$5.36B, above analyst consensus of $5.27B. Interested in $74 level, other than that not too interested in the stock. No new risks beyond whatever has been said before (slower user growth, regulatory risks, platform outages, problems with minors, etc). Buy your kids some Robux!\n\n[**MSFT (Microsoft)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=MSFT&p=d)\\- EPS of $3.46 vs. $3.22 expected and revenue of $70.07B vs. $68.42B expected. Capex surged to $16.75B, up 53% YoY, as it ramps up AI infrastructure, noting expected AI capacity constraints beyond June. Interested in seeing if it holds above $430 at market open. Its outsized AI investment was of huge interest to me- this moved a lot of Mag 7 names higher, especially NVDA. It signaled that there's still room for growth for these chip-makers. Companies that rent out computing space such as CRWV also moved higher on this as well. (It signals that they'll do better on earnings). \n\n[**META (Meta)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=META&p=d)\\- Reported stronger-than-expected Q1 revenue; Q2 sales guided to $42.5B\u2013$45.5B. Increased 2025 capex forecast to $64B\u2013$72B, citing heightened infrastructure and AI investments. Also a huge mover, interested in it if it breaks the $600 level.

I was a complete rookie and an idiot, thinking that I was good at choosing companies when it was just a ridiculous bull market, and after coming out on a small plus side, I let go of the market for a very long time.\n\nIn February of this year, my father suddenly passed away. As we were going through his accounts and our family assets, we realized he was quite good with money, and alongside his monthly pension that will be given to my mother, we learned that we were going to be well off. After careful calculation, my mother decided to keep the pension, and one third of my father's assets. I was given around two thirds of the assets, which came out to roughly 280,000$.\n\nI'm from Korea, and for my entire life, always dreamed of moving to the States for a high paying job, but never had the money to get the education in order to do so. Now I do.\n\nAfter crunching the numbers, I've decided to put aside 80,000$ to pay for my living costs, tuition costs to prepare for my education in the States, and for some traveling. This will keep me fairly comfortable until the end of 2028. Which leaves 200,000$ for me to invest in, in order to build up my net worth for my time studying in America, before finally getting a job.\n\nThen Trump announced the tariffs, and I started to reconsider everything.\n\nThankfully, I was mostly cash when the market went down, and afterwards I had invested  up to 50,000$ back into the market. Mostly focusing on either dividend heavy companies or ETF's like VOO, SCHD, KO, PEPCO, and powerhouse tech companies like NVDA, AMZN, MSFT, and other sectors, as well as companies in other countries.\n\nMy issue now is whether to wait for the doom mindset that so many people seem to have about the current US administration and the market to take full effect and tank everything, or do I just DCA into the company roster that I made for the next few months, and just let the market do its thing for the next 3 to 4 years. I know that timing the market is stupid, and even if you time it perfectly, it's so stressful anyways. I kinda just want to invest and not think about it constantly.\n\nI woud love to hear your long-term investing stories to settle my mind. Been very anxious about all of this in the last month or so.",

SMCI attributed the shortfall to delayed customer platform decisions and higher inventory reserves from older generation products. We're close to 20% down and with all the negative news on semi competition from China and server costs, I'm looking to play a bounce in this if the selloff gets worse. No real level I'm watching, likely will move with the market today. SMCI cited that inventory is increasing and as a result affected NVDA/DELL afterhours as well. DELL is down 6%! Potential supply chain disruptions like tariffs continue to be the biggest risk. \n\n[**SPY (S&P 500 ETF)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SPY&p=d) / [**QQQ (NASDAQ-100 ETF)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=QQQ&p=d)\\- The U.S. economy contracted by 0.3% in Q1 2025, marking the first decline since 2022, driven by a surge in imports and decreased government spending. Jamie Dimon said that a recession is a \"best case scenario\", ultimately looking at how bad the selloff will be today.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) edged up 0.3%, notching its longest win streak of 2025. Both indexes ended in positive territory for the fifth straight day.\n\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) fell below the flatline, as shares of Big Tech recovered from steep early-session losses.\n\nWall Street is coming off a rebounding run last week. The gains came as Trump eased pressure on Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, and hinted at light at the end of the tunnel for sky-high 145% tariffs on China. On Monday, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said it was \"up to China\" to deescalate the trade battle, though he suggested its recent moves to exempt certain US goods from duties represented a positive step.\n\nEarnings are the highlight of the week ahead, with 180 S&P 500 companies expected to report quarterly financial results.

    "selftext": "Amazon\u00a0has delayed some commitments around new data center leases, Wells Fargo analysts said on Monday, the latest sign that economic concerns may be affecting tech companies\u2019 spending plans.\n\nA week ago, a\u00a0Microsoft\u00a0executive said the software company was\u00a0slowing down\u00a0or temporarily holding off on advancing early build-outs. Amazon Web Services and Microsoft are the leading providers of cloud infrastructure, and both have ramped up their capital expenditures in recent quarters to meet the demands of the generative artificial intelligence boom.\n\n\u201cOver the weekend, we heard from several industry sources that AWS has paused a portion of its leasing discussions on the colocation side (particularly international ones),\u201d Wells Fargo analysts wrote in a note. They added that \u201cthe positioning is similar to what we\u2019ve heard recently from MSFT,\u201d in that both companies are reeling in some new projects but not canceling signed deals.\n\nTech stocks have been pressured across the board his year as\u00a0President Donald Trump\u2019s\u00a0proposals for widespread tariffs raised the prospect for dramatically higher costs on imports of equipment while also threatening to slow the economy. Cloud infrastructure providers have been aggressively announcing plans to collectively spend hundreds of billions of dollars securing\u00a0Nvidia\u2019s\u00a0graphics processing units (GPUs) and building new data centers.\n\nThat was before the announcement on tariffs earlier this month. Microsoft and Amazon both report quarterly results next week. Their stock prices were down on Monday brining Amazon\u2019s decline for the year to 25% and Microsoft\u2019s drop to 15%.\n\nAn AWS spokesperson didn\u2019t immediately provide a comment. Earlier this month, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy told CNBC\u2019s Andrew Ross Sorkin that he did not see the company cutting down on data center construction.\n\nWells Fargo has a hold rating on Amazon shares.\n\nSource: [Amazon has paused some data center lease commitments: Wells Fargo](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/21/amazon-has-paused-some-data-center-lease-commitments-wells-fargo.html)",

    "title": "This market is really not behaving well. Where do we most likely go from here?",
    "selftext": "I think traders and close market analysts realize this more than many people do. From a technical standpoint of course, but a fundamental one.\nFundamental I mean - The concerns that the market was overvalued in the first place... And that trump was going to drop a bomb on the market and dollar itself in some way, shape or form. The foregone conclusion by MSM when the bearish market began in early March that it was just tariffs and trump, or \"still a bull market\" as portrayed by cnbc and then by more MSM once we dropped more than 5 percent. The fact more people than now rely more on retirement appreciation - many times a sign of or near a market top. The talk of depression, parallels to Hoover, Smoot - Hawley, etc. I seriously doubt I honestly was the only one who had my strongest worries since when covid was emerging (but this time feels worse...)\n\nSome concerning features to me are the number of new investors /traders who keep thinking 2020 and 2022 bottoms were like this and now more than ever I'm hearing (accurately ) big drops feel scary, and they always recover. They don't have to always, it's just that they recently have. \n\nSo yeah, I guess that's the question. I don't have a crystal ball of where we are going, but where is it most likely to go? The price action last week was fairly flat-for this market. (down 8 pts on SPY) , but felt genuinely mostly worse than that. Worse case-I fear there will be an added crisis fueled by Trump in the near term or something else internal/ external but important - causing a severe down leg once again. Perhaps that could be poor earnings next week with added economic concerns, Trump firing powell and wrecking the dollar and markets more, or more countries forming \"anti USA\" trade alliances. Best case? Do we move flat in a kangaroo market? Is there significant upside potential if strong earnings come in? I've asked myself the last question a lot, and normally I'd say yes, but now I doubt that, or that the risk/reward will be skewed severely to the downside.\n\nThis is kind of the first generalized thing I've felt I could say with any degree of confidence in a while. I could look like a stupid fool a year from now, but maybe not. \n\nHere's what I've done that's not in any way trading related.  I'm adding to foreign businesses and bonds. For a larger non trading account that can't take heavy risk, that's not my own per se we bought German bonds and more Nokia stock. The bonds are up 5 percent due to the euro, and Nokia is flat. I like Nokia's business as they are not exposed to the tariff nonsense and have big contracts to provide 4g in developing countries still on older networks. This is huge business for them. I'm keeping the Berkshire position, I added to it last year, although I'm a bit surprised by its resilience so far, though I also kept Google (it's doing much worse than I would've expected) but sold two other tech stocks, aapl and Msft. Sold apple when I realized how much Berkshire itself had dumped of apple. Sold Msft because comparably it seemed more expensive and vulnerable in this downturn I thought was likely.\n\n\n\nThere's a school of thought that says \"markets aren't supposed to make us always feel comfortable\" and that this is why long term holders, ten or more years, will \"always\" or almost always be rewarded as a result. That's generally, but not always been accurate for the past 50 years.\nAnother consideration:what do you personally feel most of the public feels who have moderate stock exposure? I'm talking like portfolios of $50,000-$500,000. Some of these people may not pay attention to the markets much, but would be overly concerned of a significant market drop. They may just own etfs, or general retail investors. I personally feel many of these people are not overly concerned right now. ",

Until last year I was assuming OpenAI and MSFT will be the winner.\n\nYesterday I just witnessed Google\u2019s breakthrough with image and video generation while tinkering with their new experiment. The more I think, the more the following scenario makes sense:\n\n* Google has unlimited access to YouTube, which gives them edge over others on training video related GenAI\n\n* YouTube has already a proven business model based on user created content with ads or subscription.\n\n* I can see that with GenAI tools from Google, it\u2019ll be possible for people to create \u201cprofessional\u201d content; short movies, series, animes. Some of them will be hits.\n\n* End game, YouTube will take a big portion from the movie/series market, both watching and also production.\n\n* At some point this might mean big studios and distribution channels (including Netflix) will loose some market to YouTube.\n\n* I expect this to become visible by the end of 2026: A couple of GenAI series, created by a very small team (say 5-10). No actors, just skilled labor.\n\n* I expect the quality and quantity to increase in the next 3-5 years\n\nBased on this outlook, I\u2019m just thinking to simply buy Google stock. But I\u2019m stupid and whenever I buy stock, I loose money. What could I do? Is YouTube important enough for Google that this might boost the stock value? My horizon for this bet is like 2-3 years to play out.",

The largest risk, according to analysts, centers on the iPhone maker's overseas production hubs, which are particularly vulnerable to the tariffed countries.\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump announced tariffs that will impact some 185 countries, including the United States's largest trading partners. Additional reciprocal tariffs, for instance, will include 34% tariffs on Chinese imports, a 20% tariff on European Union imports, a 46% tariff on imports from Vietnam, 32% on imports from Taiwan, and 26% on India \u2014 all set to take effect on April 9.\n\nNotably, the additional 34% tax on China will be added to the country's existing 20% tariff, meaning its total tariff rate will rise to 54%. China is Apple's most important\u00a0[production hub](https://www.businessinsider.com/tim-cook-apple-supply-chain-trump-tariffs-china-diversify-iphone-2025-1?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=yahoo.com), with about 85% of its iPhones manufactured there.\n\n\"Apple produces basically all their iPhones in China, and the question will be around exceptions and exemptions on this tariff policy if those companies are building more operations, factories, and plants in the US[\u00a0like Apple announced in February](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/02/apple-will-spend-more-than-500-billion-usd-in-the-us-over-the-next-four-years/),\" Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said in a note to clients following the announcement.\n\nAs trade tensions escalate, Apple has moved to increase its supply chain beyond just China, boosting manufacturing in places like India and Vietnam. But with the new tariff announcements set to impact those countries too, there's now limited room for reprieve.\n\n\"The worry will be around pricing and margin impacts along with what this means for the global supply chain looking forward,\" Ives said. For now, the analyst continues to believe major negotiations will happen over the coming months as companies attempt to navigate \"this new world of tariffs.\"\n\nUntil then, he warned, \"tech stocks will clearly be under major pressure.\"\n\nOther Magnificent Seven players also faced significant selling action. In aggregate, that cohort of stocks is currently on track to eliminate over $800 billion from their collective market caps.\n\nIn afternoon trade, Amazon ([AMZN](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMZN)) and Nvidia ([NVDA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NVDA)) each fell 7%, followed by a 6% drop in both Alphabet ([GOOGL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOGL)) and Tesla ([TSLA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA)). Meta ([META](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/META)) dipped 3%, while Microsoft ([MSFT](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MSFT)) was off just under 2%.\n\nOutside of the Mag Seven, chip stocks faced similar declines, despite the exemption of semiconductors from Trump's additional tariffs. Nvidia competitor Broadcom ([AVGO](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AVGO)), for example, erased well over $50 billion from its market cap following an 8% drop in shares.\n\n\"The implications \\[of the announced tariffs\\] are broad-reaching, and we see negative implications for the whole \\[chip\\] sector,\" KeyBanc analyst John Vinh wrote in a note to clients. \"These are most notably going to negatively impact end-demand in key markets including smartphones/iPhones and PCs, as a significant amount of manufacturing is done within China.\"\n\nStacy Rasgon, Bernstein's managing director and senior analyst, added in an interview with Yahoo Finance that the biggest headwind for semiconductors is not necessarily the direct impact of tariffs. Rather, it's the risk of demand destruction as these products become more expensive.\n\nHe added, \"The other risk for semis is that they are very cyclical, very global, and very correlated to the macro and to GDP.\u00a0[So if this tips us into recession,\u00a0](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/us-economy-dangerously-vulnerable-to-recession-wall-street-reacts-to-tariff-fallout-155837444.html)that's probably not going to be great.\"",

    "title": "CoreWeave, the biggest IPO of 2025. (DD on $CRWV)",
    "selftext": "# I love IPOs.\n\nThe last IPO I thought was amazing was ARM (and how far we've come!).  Coreweave (IPOing on the 28th!) is another one I think has a ton of potential. (I wrote the majority of this before the reduced IPO sizing so please forgive me if my math is incorrect).\n\nCoreWeave is a cloud infrastructure provider specializing in GPU computing, called an \u201cAI hyperscaler.\u201d They run data centers full of GPUs and rent out that computing power to customers via the cloud. Similar to AWS/Azure, but they're focused on AI/ML/GPU tasks like making stupid Studio Ghibli pictures of yourself.\n\nCRWV started in 2017 mining ETH but pivoted to being a GPU farm in 2019 after the crash. By 2022, they fully exited crypto mining and doubled down on enterprise GPU cloud services\u200b. This early mover advantage in GPU hosting, (along with all the GPUs they bought from NVDA), have made it a player in the the cloud services space.\n\nCRWV makes money by charging for usage-based cloud compute - clients pay for GPU hours on their servers.\u200b Initially, they served niches like VFX studios (movies like Interstellar take millions of GPU hours to render), but now AI training and inference workloads are the main growth driver\u200b.\n\nCompanies like META/IBM/MSFT have used CRWV for AI compute needs in the past\u200b. CRWV's differentiator is through software- they claim custom scheduling software (e.g. a system called \u201cSUNK\u201d and an optimizer \u201cTensorizer\u201d) that yields better hardware utilization, faster container spin-ups, and higher throughput than general-purpose which makes them more efficient to use.\n\nIn practice, that means a customer training a large ML model might get results faster or cheaper on CRWV than on AWS. CRWV currently operates 32 data centers with 250k+ NVDA GPUs and are very aggressive in acquiring them- they deploy A100, H100, and H200s and are prioritized as customers of NVDA.\n\n**The NVDA Relationship**\n\nNVDA backs CRWV, and they're strong partners (which means they prioritize each other over other customers). Due to this, I dismiss the possibility that CRWV will ever have troubles on the supply side of obtaining GPUs. Something that is fairly common knowledge is that NVDA (and other companies) prefer selling GPUs in bulk because it simplifies customer service and they can charge for enterprise support and  sell thousands at a time. It's also why NVDA spits on the face of their gaming customers.\n\n**Isn't it kind of shady that NVDA both invests and is a customer of CRWV? Why doesn't NVDA use their own chips instead of renting capacity from CRWV?**\n\nKind of. Nothing they've done is outright illegal (even using their GPUs as collateral is within the law). Even companies that build GPUs need to rent compute when there's a massive amount of demand. MSFT did it, NVDA did it, OpenAI WILL do it. CRWV signed a direct deal with OpenAI: a multi-year commitment up to $11.9\u202fB for GPU cloud capacity\u200b. They have ties to the major AI players. This entire DD going forward assumes that they will continue to keep their relationship with NVDA because NVDA needs them so AWS doesn't swallow the entire market. \n\n**The Financials**\n\nCRWV has had ridiculous growth- In 2022, they had revenue of $15.8\u202fM (the majority of which came from ETH mining). In 2023, their GPU computing pivot led to revenue of $229M, then $1.9B in 2024. This was obviously fueled by the release of ChatGPT as demand for GPU compute exploded as other companies scrambled to compete with their OWN LLM models.\n\nBy 2024, CRWV neared $2\u202fB in annual sales, transforming from a niche player to a major cloud provider in two years.\n\nThe financial issue is that CRWV is unprofitable as it scales. In 2023, it lost \\~$600M, and in 2024m \\~$860M. For every $1 of revenue in 2024, they spent about $1.45 for huge investments in data centers, GPUs, and the associated operating costs (plus interest on debt they've taken out which they have a ton of).\n\nThe S-1 shows operating costs close to \\~$1B from tech/infra in 2024, which includes data center space, buying/depreciating their GPUs, electricity costs, maintenance staff, etc. The capex is massive and is funded largely by debt.\n\nThe cash burn is brutal as well- at the end of 2024 CRWV still has negative FCF (which is normal for a pre-ipo high growth tech startup) and is betting that they will eventually claw their way to profitability despite the brutal looking financials (like Uber, Snowflake, Robinhood, insert your choice of tech startup here lol). The bet is that high upfront investment now will secure long-term contracts and scale to profitability later, like most tech IPOs.\n\n**Customer Concentration**\n\nIn 2023, Microsoft accounted for \\~35% of CRWV\u2019s revenue\u200b. In 2024, that grew to \\~62% of total revenue\u200b. Their S-1 mentioned that close to \\~80% of their revenue comes from two customers alone. But this is a warning sign because MSFT wants to build their own (hence their announcement of spending \\~$80B in 2025 for AI data centers).\n\n**If MSFT scales back their use of CRWV then they are frankly fucked.** MSFT's CEO also mentioned that using external capacity (like CRWV) for GPUs was a short-term stopgap until their own investment in Azure pays off.\n\nHowever, the OpenAI deal (remember that OpenAI is 49% owned by MSFT) could take the place of MSFT going forward. The contract is up to $11.9B through 2030\u200b, which averages out to \\~$2B/year if used, which is equivalent to all of CRWV's 2024 revenue.  If OpenAI maximizes their usage, CRWV\u2019s revenue could potentially double at minimum if MSFT doesn't pull out. This is a wild hopium optimistic case but I thought it was worth mentioning.\n\nBeyond those two, CRWV has other customers that make up the \\~20% of 2024 revenue). These include research labs, VFX studios, and other tech companies but none are individually as large compared to the MSFT/OpenAI. What will make or break this company in the long run is the diversification of the client base because all their eggs are in one basket.\n\n**IPO Technicals**\n\nCRWV sold 37.5M shares at $40/share, getting $1.5B and giving it a $20B valuation. That was below CRWV's official target of offering 49M shares at $47-$55, raising up to $2.7B at $32B valuation\u200b. This signals a lack of interest in the initial offering and is not great news if you already hold the stock, but is excellent if you're a short term trader that wants to see a pop on IPO day- the stock has more room to run. Yes, this means it's good for retail, bad for insiders.\n\n**Valuation/Comparables**\n\nIs a \\~$20B valuation reasonable for CRWV? You can do a rough comparison:\n\n|**Company**|Annual Revenue (2024)|**Recent Valuation**|**EV/Revenue Multiple**|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|**CoreWeave** (CRWV)|$1.92\u202fB|\\~$20B (target IPO)|\\~10\u00d7|\n|**Snowflake** (SNOW)|$3.41\u202fB\u200b|\\~$52\u202fB (market cap)|\\~15\u00d7 \u200b|\n|**Databricks**\\*|\\~$3\u202fB by end of 2025|\\~$62\u202fB \u200b|\\~20\u00d7|\n|**AWS** (AMZN)|$107.6\u202fB\u200b|\\~$500\u202fB|\\~4-5\u00d7|\n\n(That's not a typo- AWS is valued at \\~$500B, it's the main driver of AMZN's growth, yet struggles to grow because it's already massive). \\*Also note that Databricks is a private company\n\nI think that if the company can maintain a hyper-growth trajectory (e.g. 2-3\u00d7 growth for a couple more years), then an 10\u00d7 multiple now could look cheap in hindsight. For instance, 2025 revenue could hit \\~$4\u202fB+ with the OpenAI ramp and other clients. Of course, we have risks like growth decelerating, and tariffs and Trump and China that could come in and decimate growth. And of course, they're not profitable (for now). Ironically, CRWV and other US firms would BENEFIT from chip restrictions because they'd be prioritized over the overseas ones that use NVDA chips.\n\nCRWV\u2019s valuation is aggressive (dare I say fair for a hyperscaler), but in line  with other cloud providers. The entire short term bull thesis depends on them retaining MSFT as a customer and also keeping OpenAI- if that occurs then investing in it now looks like a no-brainer. If not, **it's completely possible we see an 50%+ selloff. I think that's the reason why we're seeing such hesitancy in this valuation.**\n\nThis valuation is also dependent on entirely dependent on AI spending GROWING, society seeing greater integration in AI (more than we have now), and AI firms willing to continue spending on compute they can't harness themselves. We are still supply constrained on GPUs in general, and if we ever experience NVDA building more GPUs than there is demand for, then Coreweave's margins are threatened and profitability can vanish. For now, it looks like that is unlikely to happen.\n\n**IPO Trading Details**\n\n37.5M shares is decent IPO volume so I don't expect this to be illiquid when it trades. The main things I watch for are indication price (whether there are people who want to buy the print of the stock higher than what we IPO at) and share paired (which somewhat signal when the IPO will open for trading).\n\nOverall, this is a pure AI play on GPU compute, a bet that demand for GPUs will continue to outstrip supply,  and that MSFT/OpenAI/every other tech firm involved won't slit their throat in in the eternal game of thrones that is capitalism.\n\n**TL;DR:** There's a hell of a lot of risk, but I like the stock. It's completely possible it could open and sell off because the insiders just want to bail. It's possible that it skyrockets. Anything is possible in the wild and crazy world of IPO trading.\n\nSource:\n\n[Majority of it came from S-1 on the SEC site](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1769628/000119312525044231/d899798ds1.htm), the rest from other random tech sites and background knowledge of cloud hyperscalers.",

Tesla shorts alone have raked in nearly $11 billion, while bets against Nvidia have brought in more than $4 billion.\n\nTesla's 40% year-to-date drop has led the declines of the so-called Magnificent Seven stocks.

    "title": "Trump's DOJ wants a Google breakup but is willing to leave AI alone",
    "selftext": "President Trump and his predecessor, Joe Biden, now largely agree on a major point that has the potential to reshape the tech world: Google should be broken up.\n\nBut there is an important difference that emerged in a filing last Friday: Trump\u2019s Justice Department wants to let Google (GOOG, GOOGL) keep its investments in artificial intelligence. It notably has a stake in OpenAI rival Anthropic worth billions.\n\nBacking off the Biden administration's request to force Google to sell off its AI bets was \"significant\" and \"very justified,\" said Mark McCareins, a business law professor at Northwestern University\u2019s Kellogg School of Management.\n\nIt \"may be an indication that the government worries about deterring AI advances in the global race with China,\" added David Olson, associate law professor at Boston College Law School.\n\nThe stock of Google's parent, Alphabet, dropped more than 4% Monday as other tech stocks also sold off on macroeconomic concerns.\n\nThe final decision on what happens to Google's $2 trillion empire in court will be in the hands of federal judge Amit Mehta, who ruled last August that Google illegally monopolized online markets for \"general search\" and \"general search text.\u201d\n\nNo matter what Mehta decides, Google is expected to appeal, and the DOJ can too. Hearings to decide on remedies in this case are slated for April and May.\n\nFinal remedy recommendations from the government and Google were due to the judge Friday, giving a Trump-led DOJ one last chance to alter the prior Biden-era suggestion to the judge that Google be broken up with the forced sale of Google\u2019s Chrome browser or contingent sale of its Android operating system.\n\nIt didn\u2019t do so, despite being lobbied by the company to reconsider the Chrome proposal on national security concerns.\n\n\"Google must divest the Chrome browser \u2014 an important search access point,\" the DOJ stated in its final proposal on Friday.\n\nIt argued that under a different owner, new rivals would have an \u201copportunity to operate a significant gateway to search the internet, free of Google\u2019s monopoly control.\u201d\n\nThey also retained part of a request to leave the door open to a possible divestiture of Google's Android operating system.\n\nBut prosecutors did drop the Biden DOJ's push for Google to sell off its AI bets, instead suggesting a setup where federal authorities could keep tabs on proposed AI investments that could threaten search competition.\n\nAnthropic has argued to the judge that forcing Google to relinquish its stake would tilt the AI playing field in favor of OpenAI and its backer, Microsoft (MSFT).\n\n\u201cPlaintiffs no longer seek the mandatory divestiture of Google\u2019s AI investments,\u201d the DOJ said Friday in its revised proposal.\n\nDerek Mountford, a shareholder in Gunster's business litigation practice group who specializes in antitrust litigation, said while the Trump administration's AI rollback is a concession, it comes with a hook.\n\n\"They're asking for some reporting requirements to be attached to it,\" he said.\n\n\"I think one of the [antitrust] themes you might see in a second Trump administration is even if they're walking back some of the proposed sanctions, there's still that element of control and monitoring and enforcement that's going on in the background.\"\n\nThe tension for the Trump administration, Chamber of Progress CEO Adam Kovacevich told Yahoo Finance last week, is that it is engaged in an existential fight with China for the future of AI and Google can still be an important weapon for the US.\n\n\"What are we going to do, hobble one of our main US runners in that race by breaking up that company?\u201d asked Kovacevich, who previously led Google's US policy strategy and external affairs team.\n\n\"It seems ill-timed to do that.\"\n\nThe DOJ did stick with another expected remedy proposal that strikes at a major contention in the case.\n\nIt asked the judge to block Google from contracts that secure its search engine as the default across dozens of internet-connected devices, such as mobile phones made by Apple (AAPL), Samsung, and others, and browsers, including Apple\u2019s Safari and Mozilla\u2019s Firefox.\n\nThat is not good news for Apple, jeopardizing a major revenue stream. In 2021, Google paid $26 billion for default search placements, and the lion's share of that went to Apple.\n\nBernstein analysts have estimated Apple\u2019s revenue from Google Search defaults is somewhere between $18 billion and $20 billion per year.\n\nGoogle countered the DOJ\u2019s request on Friday by asking that it still be free to enter into contracts to make Google search a default \u2014 so long as it does not condition search licensing based on device manufacturers also agreeing to distribute, preload, place, display, use, or license its AI Gemini Assistant Application.\n\nMcCareins, the law professor at Kellogg, said the DOJ has little to lose at this stage by holding on to Chrome divestment as a negotiating chip, given that both the underlying case and the judge's decision on remedies are subject to appeal.\n\n\"Just from a bargaining negotiating position, at this stage of the proceedings, I am not shocked or stunned that the new sheriffs in town have continued to argue for divestiture of Chrome,\" McCareins said.\n\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/trumps-doj-wants-a-google-breakup-but-is-willing-to-leave-ai-alone-080016759.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAACYwia9l044SxGCK_mri0gx-4TVLrnZzE1cLyqspOVq-n2zGEeY521rJZBcbAtAtZpG9pjQwjgHdoWCYutDGYaydayerBR3eZ7CxOK4KvoFb-5qR8PHIRJROnWQ40ALMQ9_HnlhH1NvgeQDycPTYmotjrq1CJK9_Z0lsxa8n3nyq",

    "selftext": "Feb 24 (Reuters) - An analyst note flagging a possible slowdown by Microsoft\u00a0[(MSFT.O), opens new tab](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/MSFT.O)\u00a0in leasing data center capacity grabbed the market's attention on Monday, lending credence to skepticism among investors worried that the AI-led stock-market boom might be running out of steam.\n\nTD Cowen analysts in a note Friday said the tech giant had scrapped leases for sizeable data center capacity in the United States, suggesting potential oversupply as it builds out artificial intelligence infrastructure.The brokerage, citing its supply chain checks, said Microsoft has canceled leases totaling \"a couple of hundred megawatts\" of capacity with at least two private data-center operators, the analysts led by Michael Elias said.Microsoft's plan to invest over $80 billion in AI and cloud capacity this fiscal year remains on track, a company spokesperson said. \"While we may strategically pace or adjust our infrastructure in some areas, we will continue to grow strongly in all regions,\" the spokesperson added.While Microsoft shares were little affected - the stock lost 1% on Monday - related companies took a hit. Shares of German firm Siemens Energy\u00a0[(ENR1n.DE), opens new tab](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/ENR1n.DE)\u00a0and French company Schneider Electric\u00a0[(SCHN.PA), opens new tab](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/SCHN.PA)\u00a0fell 7% and 4%, respectively.U.S. utility companies Constellation Energy\u00a0[(CEG.O), opens new tab](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/CEG.O)\u00a0and Vistra\u00a0[(VST.N), opens new tab](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/VST.N), which provide power for data centers, lost 5.9% and 5.1%, respectively. Tech bellwethers were lower as part of a broader Nasdaq selloff.Investor skepticism over the billions that U.S. tech firms have channeled into AI infrastructure has grown due to slow payoffs and breakthroughs at Chinese startup DeepSeek, which showcased AI tech at a much lower cost than its Western [rivals.Microsoft](http://rivals.Microsoft) had also paused converting statement of qualifications, or precursors to formal leases, TD Cowen analysts said, adding that other tech firms including Meta Platforms\u00a0[(META.O), opens new tab](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/META.O)\u00a0had previously made similar moves to lower capital spending.\"I don't construe it as any change up in the big macro picture. \n\nTheir desire is to build out these data centers,\" said Dan Morgan, senior portfolio manager at Synovus Trust, which owns shares in Microsoft.Any lease cancellations would mark a sharp shift for Microsoft, which has been spending billions of dollars on data centers to overcome supply bottlenecks that have limited its ability to meet AI demand.The news could possibly indicate lower demand, Bernstein analyst Mark Moelder said, especially after lackluster quarterly results from major cloud companies, but it was also reflective of the capacity build-up at Microsoft in the past years.\"Microsoft needed to meet demand and had a great deal of difficulty finding capacity. Management may, therefore, have rented, even at a meaningful premium, data centers and GPU capacity and negotiated more deals for additional future capacity than they needed,\" Moelder added.\n\n  \n",

    "title": "Skype to Shut 14 Years After Microsoft\u2019s $8.5 Billion Purchase",
    "selftext": ">Microsoft Corp.\u00a0is signaling the end of the line for Skype, the iconic internet calling and chat service it bought almost 14 years ago.\n\n>Once a byword for digital calls that bypassed long-distance charges, Skype was surpassed in recent years by smartphone-native communication apps and Zoom video calls. When Microsoft tried to stretch the Skype brand into the workplace, it lost out to\u00a0Slack Technologies Inc.\n\n>Microsoft\u2019s response was to start from scratch and build Teams, a chat, voice and video communication service for the workplace, which gained ground as part of its software bundle. The Redmond, Washington-based company will offer Skype users the option of migrating to Teams, which is now its strongest rival to Salesforce Inc.-owned Slack, before it shuts down in May.\n\n>\u201cI\u2019ve been at Microsoft for over 30 years, and there\u2019s a lot of software that we\u2019ve done that was incredibly valuable in its era, and then the next era came and it was the foundation,\u201d said\u00a0Jeff Teper, a Microsoft president who oversees communications and collaboration tools.\n\n>Microsoft said there were more than 300 million monthly Skype users\u00a0in 2016, but its daily user count had dwindled to 36 million\u00a0in 2023. Teams, by comparison, has risen to 320 million monthly users.\n\n>Founded in 2003 by Nordic entrepreneurs, Skype at one time was owned by\u00a0eBay Inc.\u00a0and was in the hands of a private equity-led consortium when\u00a0Steve Ballmer\u00a0came knocking. The then-Microsoft boss made an uncharacteristically splashy bet on the market leader in online calls, paying $8.5 billion, a 40% premium to Skype\u2019s internal valuation. The May 2011 deal was the largest acquisition by Microsoft at the time, and Skype became a key piece of its strategy for the emerging mobile age.\n\n>It didn\u2019t pan out as Ballmer would have hoped. Upstarts like Telegram, Snapchat, WeChat and WhatsApp solved problems that Skype didn\u2019t. Microsoft\u2019s center of gravity in corporate software ultimately ensnared Skype, which found itself in the Office division and under orders to build tools geared toward a workplace audience as well as a consumer one.\n\n>By the time Slack arrived on the scene, Skype users were complaining that elements of the core experience had started to\u00a0break down. They cited missed or phantom calls and failures to sync information on different devices. The company worked to improve the service\u2019s reliability, but some loyal users were put off by frequent redesigns, including a short-lived effort to fashion Skype in the mold of Snapchat.\n\n>Microsoft, which also saw its acquisition of Nokia Oyj\u2019s mobile phone business end in failure, is far from alone in encountering rejection by a fickle consumer market.\u00a0Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google has cycled through several iterations and brands for its online communications tools, which are today known as Chat and Meet. And this month,\u00a0Amazon.com Inc.\u00a0said it would be winding down Chime, the video and voice calling service it tried with little success to sell to corporate clients.\n\n>The Windows maker is shuttering Skype to focus on developing new features for Teams, including artificial intelligence tools, Teper said. The company is working to infuse AI into its product suite, while keeping a lid on spending that isn\u2019t part of that effort. It\u2019s reassigning staff that had worked on Skype to other areas of the business and will not lay anyone off, Teper added.\n\n>At one point, Skype played host to one of Microsoft\u2019s biggest AI demonstrations: a real-time translator. Chief Executive Officer\u00a0Satya Nadella\u00a0had nudged researchers to bring the product to market as quickly as possible and heralded it as \u201cmagical\u201d in a 2014 demonstration early on in his tenure.\n\n>Teams is \u201cgoing well and this is a step to double down on it,\u201d Teper said, adding that Microsoft wanted to keep Skype running until it was confident that the Teams version for individual users was fully ready. \u201cIt\u2019s the most successful product in its category by far,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nLink: [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-28/microsoft-msft-to-shut-down-skype-as-zoom-teams-dominate-video-calls](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-28/microsoft-msft-to-shut-down-skype-as-zoom-teams-dominate-video-calls)\n\n**My Take:** Thank god. ZM might stand to be a major benefactor from this. MSFT already has Teams that serves as a workplace call tool, but Skype has tried to expand into the workplace forum space (like Slack) and has failed. MSFT is citing this more as a doubling-down on Teams rather than admitting ZM has eaten their lunch here.",

    "selftext": "INTC is green on the day, which is extremely suspect given it's priced as a company with no moat, no product, no foundries, 50B in debt and no CEO.\n\nLet's start with addressing the rumors.\n\n* GlobalFoundries announced that [their CEO is stepping down in May](https://gf.com/gf-press-release/globalfoundries-announces-leadership-transition-to-drive-next-phase-of-growth/). He is to stay on as Executive Chairman.\n* A January Bloomberg report ([paywall](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-17/biden-s-chips-team-hands-off-52-billion-program-to-a-skeptical-trump)) suggests the two companies are considering a merger, but that the US won't allow it unless the UAE government gives up their 80% controlling stake in GF.\n* Dr. Thomas Caulfield is replacing Ahmed Yahia, which was installed by the UAE government just after the purchase to control their 80% interest. Why would they let go of their man unless they were getting ready to divest?\n* Company jets for GF, QCOM, INTC and Musk were all at Mar-a-Lago (source: dylan522p (SemiAnalysis) on X, which I can't link) just after the SemiAccurate article \"[Sources Say Intel Is An Acquisition Target](https://www.semiaccurate.com/2025/01/17/sources-say-intel-is-an-acquisition-target/)\".\n* Someone bought [$170M worth of INTC stock](https://i.imgur.com/LHzDkgp.png) yesterday after market, which is about the same number as Pat's performance-based compensation when he joined in 2021. (INTC's board might not want to surrender shares from their treasury at this price).\n* INTC and GF are both critical suppliers. In the words of CSIS: [Too Good to Lose: America\u2019s Stake in Intel](https://www.csis.org/analysis/too-good-lose-americas-stake-intel). (CSIS also has an amazing YouTube channel for policy discussions).\n\nNow for why everyone is wrong in thinking Intel is a bad company:\n\n* Their gamble to regain process superiority by developing five technology nodes in four years is paying off. Intel 3 is in HVM and 18A will by the end of the year. Yields are looking good and they even signed up Microsoft as a customer (meaning, some of that $80B MSFT capex for OpenAI inference is likely to go to 18A).\n* 18A is not only competitive, but market leading. TSMC doesn't have an answer to Intel's backside power delivery, and lower impedance = lower losses.\n* If you thought 18A was cool, wait until you learn about 14A. 18A is the stepping stone for the real high-volume money maker, 14A.\n* 14A is going to be manufactured on NA EUV machines, which TSMC doesn't even have. Again, Intel bought all of them for last year.\n* On the product side, we know from the current Lunar Lake CPUs (manufactured on TSMC 3N, a worse node than 18A), that is has [nothing to envy to AMD's offerings](https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/lunar-lake-allegedly-smokes-z1-extreme-handheld-gaming-champ-in-early-gaming-benchmarks).\n\nThe last point is, of course, tariffs, promised to be between 25% and 100%, to incentivize onshoring of chip manufacturing. They might be announced and not implemented for at least a year, to give time to the market to move to 18A/14A, but they are going to happen, as it's perfectly reasonable policy (have you seen those Chinese landing ships?).\n\nA lot of this content was taken from the r/intelstock subreddit, which I hope the mods are ok with me linking!\n\nLast here is a [comparision of process tecnologies](https://i.imgur.com/uLxrb8x.png) for TSMC (A16, 3N) and INTC (14A/18A).",

    "title": "Thinking about NVDA beyond 2025 Hyperscaler CapEx Growth",
    "selftext": "With 3/4 hyperscalers reporting earnings already, the reaction to Nvidia has been positive, but stock still trades less than before DeepSeek. I believe the sentiment is that while 2025 will be great, Nvidia is nearing the \"end of great times\" and moving to a \"just good times\".\n\n**Here's my take at a breakdown. I am not an expert, but have read a lot of positive and negative takes, I'm starting this thread to start a discussion not to pump the stock. Please don't comment \"Nvidia diamond hands durr\".**\u00a0I didn't use AI to write this sadly.\n\nI can't link out to some of the resources, but tried to describe them for easy search and find.\n\n**TLDR:**\u00a0Meeting 2025 revenue projections isn't at excessive risk based on CapEx raises so far. It's likely that production capacity may really be the limiting reagent for 2025 revenues not demand. Market is forward looking and there is uncertainity on 2026+ revenues (DeepSeek is one of them) - markets don't like that. However, uncertainity is an opportunity if Nvidia can deliver again - remember stocks climb a wall of worry.\n\n**Disclosure:**\u00a0Own a lot of NVDA. But have covered calls on them, so not a blindfold risktaker.\n\n**Personal take:**\u00a0NVDA is attractive at these levels, but I'd be cautious holding my entire position after the summer 2025 earnings calls from the hyperscalers, because if there's any indication there is a 2026 CapEx slowdown, stock could fall a lot. I can't predict the future, so diversification is important even if you like the stock.\n\nHowever, continued chip innovation that maintains a competitive advantage that leads to higher end customer ROIs compared to other chip alternatives would help. Also, release of one tangible AI product would change the sentiment and game here (e.g. Robotaxis, enterprise solutions used common place for F500 companies, etc). Many are already underway - my company is releasing Gemini for all employees - this goes beyond software engineers. I think diversification across the industry (AVGO, TSM, power producers) could be valuable as time progresses as the AI use case boom happens.\n\n\\-----------------------------------------\n\n**(1) Meeting 2025 Revenue projections isn't at excessive risk based on CapEx raises so far**\n\nBased on\u00a0[stockanalysis](https://stockanalysis.com/stocks/nvda/forecast/)\u00a0consensus 2024 to 2025 revenue growth is estimated to be 52%.\n\n1. MSFT: 55.7B in 2024 to 80B in 2025\n2. Google: 52.5B in 2024 to 75B in 2025\n3. Meta: 39B in 2024 to 60B - 60B in 2025\n\nBased on the numbers written above, the anticipated growth from hyperscaler capex spend is 46% (if we assume concentration of NVDA chip spend as percent of capex steady). Hyperscalers are estimated to be about 50% of Nvidia revenue. To reach the 52% target that means from the remainder of the revenue book, Nvidia needs 58% spend increase.\n\nThis doesn't seem unreasonable.\u00a0**Potential**\u00a0investments through StarGate (Oracle), OpenAI's increasingly independent spending funded by Softbank, and sovereign AI investments are a tailwind to that figure. However, sustained export controls (e.g. Biden's global export framework) and increased crackdowns are headwinds.\n\n**(2) It's likely that production capacity may really be the limiting reagent for 2025 revenues not demand**\n\nBased on multiple\u00a0[sources](https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/nvidias-blackwell-gpus-are-sold-out-for-the-next-12-months-chipmaker-to-gain-market-share-in-2025?utm_source=chatgpt.com), seems like Blackweel is sold out for the next 12 months anyways. So 2025 revenues may be a matter of strong production. Moreover, from the commentary that google had on their earnings call - seems like cloud growth is supply constrained by infrastructure rather than demand constrained. I believe for 2025 at least customers will buy as many NVIDIA chips as they can and its production that determines valuation.\n\nSince the market is forward looking, 2025 revenue misses won't be as crucial as addressing the question of when is the demand going to slow down and the AI semiconductor sales from NVDA slowdown?\n\n**(3) Market is forward looking and there is uncertainity on 2026+ revenues (DeepSeek is one of them)..markets don't like that**\n\nNo matter how you slice it, DeepSeek has provided true software driven advances that more efficiently use Nvidia GPUs and non-NVDA GPUs on the training and particularly inference level. You can look at the cost per inference token for DeepSeek vs. OpenAI. It has raised questions on the sustainability on needing cutting edge chips at high margins in the long run. Risks below.\n\n* **Do closed loop models even have a moat over open source?**: Can closed-loop/proprietary LLMs develop models that demand a strong ROI justifying investment in more chips to\u00a0**train**\u00a0better models that\u00a0**end users are willing to pay for**? Currently Sam Altman & Dario (Antropic) think compute is the way to go. However, at some point they could discover more compute for training =/= better or more efficient models.\n* **Training:**\u00a0Efficiencies in hardware utilization may reduce Nvidia's moat in interconnectivity and lead to better training advances, which could reduce margins if other chips are \"somewhat as good\" eventually given demand equalizes to supply.\u00a0See point # 1 in this excellent recap here  (available by searching DeepSeek and the ramification on the AI industry: winners and losers? by Rihard Jarc)\n* **More use cases in a post training world could mean more inference on custom chips & competitor products:**\u00a0It is widely believed that Nvidia is more of an undisputed leader in training performance vs. inference. If open source models become good enough and training investments do not result in monetizable ROI, Nvidia's margins likely fall as custom chips and other semiconductor players provide good solutions.\u00a0[Jevon's Paradox (more use cases and usage)](https://www.npr.org/sections/planet-money/2025/02/04/g-s1-46018/ai-deepseek-economics-jevons-paradox)\u00a0is very likely here, but volume would have to increase signficantly to offset margin decreases - a risk that the market doesn't like.\n* **CUDA alternatives leads to market share loses?:**\u00a0CUDA is widely known to be the best option \"coding\" platform to get GPUs to do what you want right now.\u00a0[However, there are other applications coming out that allow fungible usage of other chips.\u00a0](https://www.theregister.com/2024/12/17/nvidia_cuda_moat/#:~:text=If%20you're%20doing%20low,AMD%20hardware%20%E2%80%93%20and%20vice%20versa)This reduces the need to use Nvidia chips and pay such high margins. There's drawbacks to not using CUDA that I'll highlight in section 4.\n\nSidenote - there is an\u00a0honest and excellent podcast on DeepSeek implications to Nvidia from Bankless w/ Jeffrey Emmanuel (whose blogpost got a lot of investors interested in DeepSeek impact over 2 weekends ago). Please listen.\n\n**(4) However, uncertainity is an opportunity if Nvidia can deliver again - remember stocks climb a wall of worry.**\n\n* **Early innings of the AI story:**\u00a0Models are going to get more complex not stagnate. This requires more training compute as we try to reach AGI level models. On the inference front, as more use cases explode, there will be more general chip demand. We haven't even seen full released use cases in robotics, autonomous transit, healthcare AI, etc.\n* **CUDA is the lowest latency**\u00a0and provides best performance as of now. There might be a technical limit to how well alternatives perform.\n* **Cost of being last**\u00a0in AI is too great for hyperscalers\n* **Continued innovation leadership:**\u00a0Nvidia has expedited it's semiconductor cycle from 2 years to 1 year. Rubin (next gen AI chips) are already being worked on.

Revenue of $7.66 billion vs. $7.5 billion expected. Ultimately said that data center segment revw will be down in Q1, but had clear positive outlook in 2025 and expected double digit revenue growth. This was what caused the stock to fall despite the initial spike.\n\n**Technicals:** Watching $100 level, but doesn't seem to be an irrational move in my opinion. Note that we've moved from $150 to $107 in the past 3 months.\n\n**Risks:** The vast majority of NVDA/AMD/every semiconductor's business's money comes from selling to businesses- individual consumers are a tiny slice of the pie despite gaming/client businesses growing, so I don't really pay attention to them (one exception is NVDA'S 50 series GPUs selling out within 5 minutes) . We also have threats from NVDA dominance, possible regulations from the US, etc, (Disclaimer: I generally don't invest in AMD)\n\n**Related Tickers:** NVDA, INTC, QCOM\n\n**Offhand Comments:** Overall doesn't seem to have affected NVDA or other semis much because what they cited was weakness that was exclusive to them and not the broader semis market.\n\n**Ticker:** [**GOOG (Alphabet Inc.)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=GOOG&p=d)\n\n**Catalyst:** GOOG/GOOGL reported fourth-quarter 2024 earnings with an EPS of $2.12 vs. $2.12 expected. Revenue of $96.5 billion vs. $96.67 billion expected. Cited FAR more spending in CapEx and a miss in cloud revenue (which signals that other competitors have taken their market share)\n\n**Catalyst/Sector Context:** Market had a pretty negative reaction to the news that they'd be investing far more in capex and missed on cloud revenue (was roughly $9B vs $12B expected).\n\n**Risks:** Elevated capital spending may pressure Alphabet's margins if the capex spending doesn't result in increased revenue, especially amidst increasing competition in the AI and cloud markets. I don't really see the China investigation to affect their stock price much, Google Search and Youtube are blocked in China and I doubt that China is going to let Waymo operate in their cities rather than creating their own solution.\n\n**Related Tickers:** MSFT, META, MAG7\n\n**Ticker:** [**UPS (United Parcel Service)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=UPS&p=d)**,** [**FDX (FedEx Corporation)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=FDX&p=d)**,** [**PDD (Pinduoduo Inc.)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=PDD&p=d)\n\n**Catalyst:** The U.S. Postal Service has suspended accepting parcels from China and Hong Kong following new tariffs imposed by Trump, affecting logistics companies like UPS and FedEx.\n\n**Technicals:** I'm mainly interested in PDD because they own Temu, which focuses on shipping small/low-cost goods to the US and using the loophole for very low shipping costs.\n\n**Catalyst/Sector Context:** The recent suspension by USPS may lead to increased demand for private carriers like UPS and FedEx to handle parcels from China. There are a number of Chinese companies that focus on shipping low cost goods (like PDD).\n\n**Risks:** Heightened tariffs and trade barriers could disrupt supply chains, increase costs, and lead to potential overreliance on private carriers, which may face capacity constraints and regulatory scrutiny.\n\n**Related Tickers:** XPO\n\n**Ticker:** [**UBER (Uber Technologies)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=UBER&p=d)\n\n**Catalyst:** Uber reported fourth-quarter 2024 earnings with an EPS of $3.21 vs. $0.48 expected. Revenue of $12B vs. $11.8B expected. Cited that they plan to do buybacks of their own stock.\n\n**Technicals:** Watching $60 level, no bias.\n\n**Catalyst/Sector Context:** Despite Uber's strong quarterly performance, they cited a potential $1 billion impact from a strong U.S. dollar on future bookings which results in worse earnings overseas.\n\n**Risks:** Outside of self-driving cars (Uber partnered with Waymo to operate in Austin), currency fluctuations and international markets affect companies you wouldn't normally expect. This may move in future from tariff news.\n\n**Related Tickers:** LYFT\n\n**Ticker:** [**USO (United States Oil Fund)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=USO&p=d)**,** [**BP (BP)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=BP&p=d)**,** [**CVX (Chevron )**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=CX&p=d)**,** **Other Oil Stocks**\n\n**Catalyst:** Trump announced that the United States plans to take over the Gaza Strip, relocate its residents to neighboring countries, and redevelop the area.\n\n**Technicals:** USO didn't move much on this piece of news, but if Trump actually makes this a policy then we might see a LOT more volatility in the future depending on how serious we get and if we get involved again.\n\n**Catalyst/Sector Context:** The oil sector is sensitive to geopolitical developments in the Middle East, a region critical to global oil supply. Initial market reactions to Trump's Gaza proposal didn't impact oil prices. Not really a catalyst TODAY but worth thinking about in the future.\n\n**Risks:** Potential escalation of regional tensions could disrupt oil production or transportation, leading to supply constraints and increased volatility in oil prices.\n\n**Related Tickers:** XOM",

This should make NVIDIA the biggest winner of this trend.\n\nAlso, OpenAI just introduced a new \"Deep Research\" AI model, designed for long-context reasoning. This will require even more compute power, further straining existing AI infrastructure. More power demand = more GPUs, networking gear, and data centers.\n\nAs long as AI models grow in complexity and scale, NVIDIA and AI infrastructure players should benefit. \n\nEven if Deepseek story was accurate, optimized model like Deepseek's will drive more demand, which will need even more powerful servers.\n\nAll the cases for yet another great year for chip makers especially NVIDIA, don't you think?",

Tariffs on Mexico/Canada are delayed, but we still have tariffs on China, and tariffs have been promised by Trump on the EU.\n\nNews: [As Trump Tariffs Take Effect, China Retaliates With Trade Measures Against U.S.](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/02/04/us/trump-tariffs-news?unlocked_article_code=1.uU4.ps2-.DRzgfM1GnN9i)\n\n**Ticker:** [**PLTR (Palantir Technologies Inc)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=PLTR&p=d)\n\n**Catalyst:** Reported earnings of $0.14 vs. $0.11 expected. Revenue of $828 million vs. $777 million expected. Management highlighted the power of AI and their sizable contracts, citing the nature of the AI war being winner-take-all.\n\n**Technicals:** PLTR absolutely exploded and hit $102 premarket, currently watching $100 level to see if we continue the move. Other than that unlikely to be trading this unless we have massive volume come in.\n\n**Catalyst/Sector Context:** The PLTR ER highlighted the growing demand for AI-driven solutions across government/commercial sectors. Company emphasized securing substantial contracts in the competitive AI landscape, important because they are more closely aligned with the current government.\n\n**Risks:** Obviously being more closely tied to the government means that it has more leeway to be more monopolistic/aggresive in their actions, Alex Karp and Peter Thiel are closely aligned with current government leaders.\n\n**Related Tickers:** MSFT, GOOGL, IBM, AMZN\n\n**Ticker:** [**NVDA (NVIDIA Corporation)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&p=d)\n\n**Catalyst:** Chinese AI company DeepSeek is reportedly preparing to switch to domestic GPUs to circumvent NVDA chip restrictions. DeepSeek has bypassed NVDA CUDA for certain operations, utilizing the PTX (Parallel Thread Execution) language instead. Additionally, on February 2nd, DeepSeek, in collaboration with SiliconFlow and Huawei Cloud, launched DeepSeek-R1/V3 inference services on Huawei's Ascend AI chips. Huawei is also promoting its new Ascend AI processors to Chinese groups considering \"inference\" as an option.\n\n**Technicals:** After the insane move we've seen from $150 to $118, I actually don't consider this to be earth shattering news- China has always been trying to develop their own semis and not using NVDA for training is what they were \"supposed\" to be doing due to the trade restrictions. I'm still long but selling calls against my position, recovery might be slow for NVDA. It's interesting that they are attempting to bypass CUDA, which is essentially the \"standard\" for ML/AI training nowadays on NVDA chips and developing their own.\n\n**Catalyst/Sector Context:** DeepSeek's move to adopt domestic GPUs and bypass CUDA indicates they're aiming for technological self-reliance amidst U.S. export restrictions, rather than trying to adopt more NVDA chips (which presumably isn't a viable long term strategy).\n\n**Risks:** Nvidia faces potential revenue loss if Chinese companies increasingly adopt domestic GPUs and alternative programming frameworks. The effectiveness of U.S. export controls may be undermined as Chinese firms develop workarounds.\n\n**Related Tickers:** AMD, INTC, QCOM, TSM\n\n**Ticker:** [**BABA**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=BABA&p=d)**/(oil stocks, car stocks, etc).**\n\n**Catalyst:** U.S. implemented a 10% tariff on all Chinese imports, aiming to address issues related to drug trafficking, particularly fentanyl. In response, China announced retaliatory tariffs effective February 10, including a 15% tariff on U.S. coal and liquefied natural gas, and a 10% tariff on crude oil, agricultural machinery, and large-engine vehicles.\n\n**Catalyst/Sector Context:** The imposition of these tariffs marks a significant escalation in U.S.-China trade tension and more volatility to come through Trump tweets- we might see a trade war again (sigh) like we did in 2019. Not 100% sure if agricultural machinery will affect stocks like DE but will look into it.\n\n**Related Tickers:** JD, BIDU, TCEHY, PDD\n\n**Offhand Comments:** There are going to be retaliation investigations against companies operating in America, INTC and GOOG have recently been announced as under investigation by China. But it's very important to remember which companies have a presence in China and which don't- for example, GOOG search hasn't worked in China since 2010 lol.\n\n**Ticker:** [**GRAB (Grab Holdings Limited)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=GRAB&p=d)\n\n**Catalyst:** Grab Holdings Ltd. is considering a takeover of its Indonesian rival, GoTo Group, at a valuation of approximately $7 billion.\n\n**Technicals:** Watching $5 level, no bias. I'm not 100% sure if there's an actual \"acquisition\" share price for GoTo but will keep eyes peeled for that acquisition premium.\n\n**Catalyst/Sector Context:** The potential merger represents a significant consolidation in SEA's ride-hailing and food delivery sectors. Mergers typically streamline operations and reduce competition, leading to improved profitability for the combined entity.\n\n**Risks:** The proposed merger may face regulatory hurdles, including antitrust concerns, which could delay or derail the deal.

Investors are coming off a losing session after the Federal Reserve held steady on rates.\n*****\n> Futures tied to the broad market index added 0.3%, while Nasdaq 100 futures advanced 0.5%. Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average were fractionally lower.\n*****\n> Shares of Meta Platforms and Tesla gained 1% and 2%, respectively, while Microsoft shares dipped more than 4% after the companies reported earnings. Meta beat on top and bottom lines, but Microsoft shares faltered after the company\u2019s quarterly revenue forecast disappointed. Tesla shrugged off an earnings and revenue miss. On the other hand, revenue misses from UPS and Caterpillar weighed the indexes down.\n*****\n> Other \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d names are set to report in the coming days, with Apple\u2019s results being due for a Thursday release. Amazon will soon follow suit, as the megacap tech company reports next week.\n*****\n> On Wednesday, all three major averages ended the session lower as a 4% decline in Nvidia weighed on the market. The declines came after the Fed paused its interest rate-cutting campaign, leaving its borrowing rate unchanged in a range between 4.25% and 4.5%. In their post-meeting statement, policymakers noted that inflation remains \u201csomewhat elevated.\u201d\n*****\n> \u201cThe implication is that we\u2019re on hold until the inflation rate goes down, and unfortunately it\u2019s probably not going to go down very much in the several months ahead, so I wouldn\u2019t be looking for rate cuts at the next meeting,\u201d Jeffrey Gundlach, DoubleLine Capital CEO, said Wednesday on CNBC\u2019s \u201cClosing Bell.\u201d\n*****\n> \u201cWe have a relatively stable place where we\u2019re standing, and it kind of supports the fact that the market is in a calm position right now, and so is [Jerome] Powell apparently,\u201d he said.\n*****\n> On the economic data front, the fourth-quarter gross domestic product reading is due on Thursday, and weekly jobless claims are out in the morning.

    "title": "Intel\u2019s CEO shakeup puts foundry plans, CHIPS Act cash at risk",
    "selftext": "Intel (INTC) is in crisis. The company forced out CEO Pat Gelsinger on Monday, its stock price is down more than 50% on the year, and the grand plan to add third-party semiconductor manufacturing to its repertoire is suddenly more unclear than ever.\n\nGelsinger\u2019s gambit to transform Intel into a US-based version of Taiwan\u2019s TSMC that builds chips for its rivals is one of the reasons the company received $7.8 billion in CHIPS Act funding. But the foundry business, which it plans to operate as an independent subsidiary, has been hemorrhaging money and its biggest customer is still Intel itself.\n\nYes, the company has picked up deals to build chips for Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon (AMZN), but that hasn\u2019t quelled calls for Intel to kill its third-party foundry plan. Bank of America Global Research analyst Vivek Arya wrote in an investor note that Intel could go as far as fully separating its design and manufacturing businesses.\n\nBut ditching its fabs, or fabrication facilities, is a lot easier said than done, especially if Intel wants to hold on to those CHIPS Act funds.\n\n\u201cThey just got the CHIPS Acts money. And if you look very closely at the details, it basically says that Intel cannot sell more than a controlling share of the manufacturing footprint,\u201d explained Mario Morales, group vice president of enabling technologies and semiconductors at IDC. \u201cSo that means that Intel will have to maintain manufacturing control of their capacity.\u201d\n\nIn other words, there\u2019s no easy path forward for the US\u2019s largest homegrown chip builder.\n\nThe Commerce Department and Intel announced the chipmaker would be getting CHIPS Act funding just last week, with the DoC saying the cash would help Intel expand its manufacturing capacity in the US, a key part of Gelsinger\u2019s plan to help the company compete with TSMC and Samsung, two of the largest chipmakers in the world.\n\nGelsinger initially unveiled the ambitious agenda, called IDM 2.0, or integrated device manufacturing 2.0, in 2021, the same year he took the reins as CEO. At the time, he said Intel would create a world-class foundry business. But Gelsinger took over an Intel beset by problems.\n\nLack of investment and missed opportunities over the years meant the company failed to catch the mobile wave and fell behind TSMC in design capabilities. And building out a global manufacturing footprint isn\u2019t cheap, which, for a company that was already hurting, wasn\u2019t ideal.\n\nGelsinger had four years to make the turnaround happen, and while Intel\u2019s chip design process is catching up, building chip manufacturing facilities takes time, more than Intel\u2019s board seemed interested in giving Gelsinger.\n\n\u201cSome of the problems that Intel had, and still has, are not things you can solve overnight. They are multiyear issues,\u201d said TECHnalysis founder and chief analyst Bob O\u2019Donnell.\n\n\u201cGelsinger started on a path to follow some of these things. And I think ultimately, at the highest level, what he chose to do, which is to get the manufacturing stuff back in shape and to work on design, is ultimately what the company needs to do.\u201d\n\nNow Intel has to make a decision: carry on with Gelsinger\u2019s plan or cut back and focus on its own chip building capabilities or give up the business entirely. But doing that means saying goodbye to CHIPS Act money unless it can get approval from the Commerce Department\n\nUnder the terms of the CHIPS Act agreement, Intel is prohibited from certain change of control transactions. If the company spins off its foundry business, it has to hold on to at least 50.1% of the voting rights of the entity if it\u2019s a private company. If the new entity goes public, a third party can\u2019t own 35% or more of it. That means Intel can\u2019t simply cut its foundry business loose and go fabless if it wants to hold on to that CHIPS money.\n\nBut moving forward with the foundry model could be difficult.\n\n\u201cI think as a combined entity it's hard to survive, because the biggest problem is your potential customers for foundry are all your competitors against Intel products,\u201d explained Gartner analyst Gaurav Gupta. \u201cSo how would they have trust in Intel foundry and become its customers, right?\u201d\n\nIf Intel does end up pulling back on its third-party manufacturing ambitions, however, it could end up eating a good portion of the losses.\n\n\u201cYou'd have to scale back. You'd have to lay off people. I'm sure there would be some sunk cost, but the alternative is you keep losing billions of dollars a quarter,\u201d Citi head of US semiconductor research Chris Danely told Yahoo Finance. \u201cSo, I think you just need to scrap it. Take your lumps. If you have to, return the money to the government.\u201d\n\nWhile Danely believes Intel should drop its goal of serving as a global foundry for other companies, he says it should continue to build its own chips.\n\n\u201cI still think they should manufacture their own CPUs,\u201d he explained. \"There's been speculation for a long time that they're just going to turn the keys over to [TSMC] and have [TSMC] make everything. We don't think that that's the right move.\u201d\n\nBefore that, however, Intel needs to find a new permanent CEO.\n\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/intels-ceo-shakeup-puts-foundry-plans-chips-act-cash-at-risk-194227625.html",

    "selftext": "The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite were in a free fall today losing 1.9% and 2.8% respectively, - a rout as traders and investors turned their noses up at Meta and Microsoft\u2019s earnings. Even Google has given up its 5% gain from yesterday. Matching the drop, the VIX closed at 23.16, and the 10-year Treasury Yield closed about the same at 4.29%. \n\nShould Apple and Amazon disappoint post-market today, I think a correction could be on. The main bullish factor countering a volatile election week, a VIX over 23 and high yields of 4.3% is strong earnings, especially from the M-7. Clearly, that doesn\u2019t seem to be happening.\n\nMeta  - Initially, it seemed like a perfunctory one percent drop on a small beat and in-line guidance, but it\u2019s gone a lot further as Meta is down 4% to 570.\n\n**Why the rout?** Analysts and investors panned high Capex plans of $40Bn and costly high-risk bets such as Meta\u2019s Reality Labs unit, (the developer of augmented and virtual reality technologies), which logged a staggering operating loss of $4.4 billion \n\nMicrosoft - (down 6% to $408) is getting clobbered for a different reason. Even as Azure grew 34%, the pace wasn\u2019t enough, and guidance of 31% to 32% in constant currency was lower than expected. However, this is due to supply chain constraints as President Amy Hood noted that the 1 or 2-point deceleration Microsoft has guided is mainly due to some supply pushouts, in terms of AI supply coming online that the company counted on. (Read, not as many Blackwells/Hoppers as they would have liked)\n\n\"We expect consumption growth to be stable compared to Q1, and we expect to add more sequential dollars to Azure than any other quarter in history,\" Hood added.\n\nThe indomitable Dan Ives of Wedbush remains as bullish as ever\u2026\n\n\"We actually disagree with this initial take as the new Azure reporting standards have moved Street numbers all around and a slight deceleration is totally expected by many investors with some supply constraints and reacceleration in 2H25, and we would be strong buyers of MSFT on any weakness this morning,\" Wedbush analysts, led by Daniel Ives, said in a note.",

I don\u2019t believe anyone can really predict the ups and downs of the market, and with the current market climbing past ATH\u2019s, the safest bets are going to be balanced long-short positions in specific equities or spread bets. \n\n**Apple**\n\n* Market cap: 3.6T\n* Current P/E: \\~36\n* Average P/E last 5 years: 28.6\n* Historical revenue growth: Flat to single digits\n* Earnings growth: Low double digits\n* Net Margin: 25%\n\n\u00a0**Microsoft**\n\n* Market cap: 3.2T\n* Microsoft P/E: \\~36\n* Average P/E last 5 years: 32.8\n* Historical revenue growth: 15%\n* Earnings growth: 15-20%\n* Net margin: 35%\n\nLast week, Apple had a higher P/E than MSFT, before this narrowed in the last few days Relative to Microsoft. Apple is still at historically high valuations relative to MSFT, despite Microsoft having better margins and growth. And the reasons are silly. Apple is getting a massive boost due to a \"potential supercycle\" with no proof that it\u2019s actually happening (even the most optimistic projections are just slightly better than last year) and mediocre software releases, while Microsoft took a large hit last quarter because it forecasted larger capex and delays in direct GenAI revenue realization.\n\nIn my view, the market is pricing in a divergent and fundamental misunderstanding of GenAI and how it makes money. The Apple bull case hypothesis is correct, it\u2019s just applied to the wrong company. The Microsoft supercycle isn\u2019t going to be from direct GenAI subscriptions like Co-pilot, it\u2019s going to be share shift towards Azure and increased utilization.\n\nTo me it is hopium to believe that retail consumers will be rushing aggressively to switch or upgrade their phones over a nascent GenAI capability that is inferior to its peers (other than privacy) and unlocks nominal value, while mid-large corporates won\u2019t be doing the exact same for Microsoft for what is widely considered a top-notch set of capabilities and proven effectiveness in several emerging use cases.\n\nHere\u2019s my prediction \u2013 regardless of where the market goes, I believe there is going to be a strong and continued divergence between Microsoft & Apple performance in the next few months, with at least another 5% gap between the winner and loser, with Microsoft\u2019s P/E once against comfortably retaking the lead from Apple. Good luck and we'll see!\n\nTl;dr: Short Apple / Long Microsoft\n\nP.S. Seeing a lot of people triggered by the tl;dr recommendation not having a basic understanding of what long-short position is. A balanced long-short position doesn't mean I believe Apple will go down on nominal terms, just that it will go down relative to Microsoft. Using options or a long-short position is the way to extract value when you see the spread in two equities increase.  ",

    "title": "I Flipped My Entire Portfolio of ETFs for AI Stocks",
    "selftext": "Yesterday, I made a major shift in my stock portfolio. I used to rely on ETFs like SPY, QQQ, and SCHD, but now I\u2019ve sold most of them and focused on NVDA, MSFT, GOOGL, ISRG, AAPL, SCHG, and a bit of SOXX.\n\n - NVDA $237K\n\n - SCHG $121K\n\n - MSFT $105K\n\n - GOOGL $78K\n\n - AAPL $74K\n\n - ISRG $64K\n\n - SOXX $61K\n\n - BRK-B $47K\n\nHere\u2019s why: Right now, AI might feel limited to things like ChatGPT, but its potential goes far beyond that. Over the next 3, 5, or 10 years, AI is going to transform industries in ways we can\u2019t fully imagine yet. We\u2019re talking about healthcare revolutionizing how we diagnose and treat patients, transportation with autonomous vehicles and drones making logistics smarter and more efficient, and manufacturing, where AI will optimize production processes and supply chains.\n\nNow, I know what you're thinking: 'What, you think the world is full of cave dwellers? Who doesn't know that?' and you're right. Everyone knows AI techonology will be advanced and utilized in so many ways in the near future.\n\nBut look, you can think of it like real estate. Sure, property values rise while new highways or shopping centers are being built, but the real surge in value happens once people start using them and see the full benefits. Right now, AI is still in its \u201cunder construction\u201d phase\u2014people can imagine the future potential, but the true value hasn\u2019t been fully realized yet. The market has priced in expectations, sure, but once AI is fully integrated across industries and we start seeing its widespread, real-world impact, I believe we\u2019ll see another major surge in stock prices. What\u2019s priced in now is just the beginning\u2014the real growth will come as AI starts transforming daily life and business on a much larger scale.\n\nBefore ChatGPT went mainstream, people assumed \u2018just\u2019 that level of AI technology would arrive soon enough, but they didn\u2019t think it would have this much of an impact on stock prices once it came to life for the public. Everyone knew advanced AI was on the horizon, but the market didn\u2019t price it like they do now. This shows just how much underestimation happens until we truly start experiencing the technology firsthand. And that\u2019s why, despite what\u2019s already been priced in, I think AI stocks are still undervalued given the game-changing growth ahead. Anyone else rethinking their portfolio with AI at the center?",

    "title": "The Crash of the stock market has arrived. Price/Earnings ratio just broke 30 for the entire S&P 500. ",
    "selftext": "Almost 90 days ago I made a post in an alternate subreddit regarding why I believe the stock market will begin to crash within 120 days -- Essentially the crash will begin by the day before the election. I have included that entire post below -- and all of these reasons still remain relevant... Moreso than ever with the news from the Middle East today. Obviously the port strike is expediting things today. Nonetheless -- I think the post is super relevant, and for some reason, the moderators of WSB deleted the post after 6 hours, despite it receiving over 2.2 million views, and over 1100 shares. \n\nThe ride the market has been on, quite simply, has been insane.\n\nAccording to generally accepted wisdom -- by investing in the S&P 500, you can anticipate to double your money, on average, every 6.5 years. I'm not 100% certain as to why that's the accepted figure -- as calculating the last 14 6.5 year periods the average rate of return has been 64%.\n\nBelow is a chart of the average price/rate of return of GSPC (The S&P) over the last 14 cycles.. I couldn't easily find data prior to this..\n\n|Year|GSPC Price|6.5 year return on investment|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n||\n|1933.5|10.91||\n|1940|12.05|10.44%|\n|1946.5|18.43|52.95%|\n|1953|26.38|43.13%|\n|1959.5|58.68|122%|\n|1966|92.88|58%|\n|1972.5|107.14|15%|\n|1979|99.93|-7.22%|\n|1985.5|191.85|91.90%|\n|1992|408.78|113%|\n|1998.5|1133.84|177%|\n|2005|1181.27|4.10%|\n|2011.5|1320.64|11.70%|\n|2018|2471.65|87.10%|\n|2024.5|5525.29|123%|\n\nWhile the last two cycles don't necessarily ring any alarm bells -- we have just more than doubled, twice, looking at the last two cycles -- There is one massive, bloated, shit filled elephant in the room... Price to Earnings Ratio.\n\nHistorically, the Price to Earnings ratio for the S&P has sat just under 20 (the easiest data I could find puts it at 19.4x between 1974 and 2017 -- I'm not grabbing any arbitrary dates or numbers here). The Median value has it under 18x, and there have even been extended periods of time where it traded at +/- 10x.\n\nCurrently -- the P/E ratio sits at 28.71 -- roughly 150% of what is normal.\n\nIn the history of the S&P, the P/E ratio has hit this level only 3 times...\n\n* Immediately preceding, and then during, the Dot Com Bubble (P/E broke 30 +/- April 2001).\n* Immediately preceding, and then during, the Global Financial Crisis (P/E broke 30 +/- October 2008).\n* The quarter after Covid hit. (P/E broke 30 +/- March 2020).\n\nImages aren't allowed in this subreddit -- but if you go to the multpl website you will see we finished trading yesterday, 09/30, at a P/E of 30.07\n\nHistorically -- what has happened to the markets after crossing this mark? In all three scenarios, by the time we crossed a P/E of 30, the dam had already started to break.\n\n* During the Dot Com bubble, the S&P 500 was already down 19% from its highs, and would fall another 34% before finally starting to recover. By the the time the bleeding stopped, it had lost 47% of its value.\n* During the global financial crisis, an almost identical story can be told. The S&P had lost 18% of its value by time P/E broke 30, and when it finally bottomed out in February of 2009, it lost 53% of its total value.\n* Covid, obviously, was a much quicker recovery... as we only fell 32%, and had bounced back in less than 6 months time (reason for which outlined later).\n\n**Okay -- so**\u00a0***Maybe***\u00a0**we have a price to earnings ratio problem, but you're still not sold. What else do we have going on?**\n\nOutside of the fact that I firmly believe that the market is overvalued today, I think there are several other major issues that we are facing in the current environment -- and while I could write a diatribe for each, for purposes of succinctness, I'll simply outline them via bullet points below.\n\n* Credit card debt is at an all time high, and outside of a brief period after Covid checks arrived, has been rising since 2013.\n* Younger Americans are in the most trouble with credit card debt. As boomers continue to retire, it will be the working class most disproportionately affected.\n* Credit card delinquency rates are the highest they've been since 2011.\n* Auto loans debt and average auto loan payments are the highest they've been at any point in history. Auto loan delinquency rates are the highest they've been since 2010.\n* The stock market is insanely top heavy right now. The Magnificent 7 (Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), and Tesla (TSLA)) now account for 45% of the entire value of the Nasdaq. They account for roughly 30% of the entire stock market combined. As of today -- they are trading at a combined P/E of 42x. A correction in these 7 companies would be absolutely catastrophic for the entire market as a whole.\n* We are starting to see a weakening of the labor market. Furthermore -- I do not believe the jobs numbers are entirely as they seem. I think many of the jobs 'added' over the last 18 months have been individuals picking up second jobs to help make ends meet. Any reasonable increase in the unemployment rate have absolutely massive consequences.\n* Many banks are holding on to massive unrealized losses. While this has the potential to hit the regional banks the worst, some of the largest banks -- including Bank of America, Charles Schwab, and USAA have unbooked security losses that are greater than 50% of their equity capital.\n* Regional banks are at risk due to the massive amounts of US treasury notes they hold that were bought during Covid. In short -- nobody was borrowing money to buy homes or cars. Banks, flush with cash, took said money and bought US T notes with this money so they could earn some interest on it. This was at a time when interest rates were very low. Now that interest rates are high -- demand for these old t notes is essentially non existent, as you buy new t notes that pay a much higher rate of return. If any sort of bank run starts, these banks will be forced to liquidate said t-bills, and they will have to sell them at a loss. If too many people do this simultaneously, the bank will become insolvent -- like what we saw happen with Silicon Valley bank, Signature Bank and First Republic Bank. (Side note -- the failure of these three banks alone was larger than the combined total of bank failures in 2008 during the global financial crisis).\n* The US government still has a spending problem. Our deficit has grown by $500 million since I started writing this an hour ago.\n* Global tensions are high -- and rising. Massive protests are erupting all over Europe.\n* The US is involved in two proxy wars that don't appear as if they will abate any time soon.\n* The political division in the US is as dramatic as I've seen it at any point in my existence. Perhaps those older and wiser than me can chime in here -- but it seems most are resorting to tribal, identity politics split down party lines.\n* Commercial real estate is starting to buckle. Covid brought about work from home, and with many offices retaining those practices, or allowing partial work from home, office space supply far outpaces demand. This problem is exacerbated by high interest rates. Most commercial loans are done on 5 or 7 year balloon. When that balloon is bout to come due, the owner of that property will refinance the loan, restarting the 5 or 7 year period to avoid paying off the balance owed on the property. Many of these property owners that refinanced into low interest rates in 2020, during covid, when rates bottomed out -- are now having to get a new loan to keep from paying their balloon. However, with interest rates more than twice what they were several years ago, and vacancy rates skyrocketing, many of these real estate owners will not be able to pay the monthly mortgage on their buildings. Commercial Real Estate foreclosures jumped 117% in March alone.\n* Housing has become increasingly less affordable for many Americans. For 2022 -- the most recent year I could find data -- a family earning the median US household income, renting a median priced US home, was spending 40% of their income on rent.\n* Countries are abandoning the US dollar in droves.\n\nI believe some of these issues, on their own, are enough to cause serious economic turmoil. Bundled together, I don't see how we aren't in for a very rude awakening.\n\n**This economic downturn may be severe.**\n\nIn the three times this has happened before -- the action, or lake thereof varied dramatically. During scenario one -- the dot com bubble -- the government largely just let the companies fail. While I was only 11 at the time, my understanding is that there really were no bailouts here because the only people really hurt were the investors in those companies -- unlike scenario two. During the GFC, shuttering banks would have resulted in a complete collapse of the US (and really global) financial system. While I won't get into partisan politics, I'm of the belief that the covid bailouts were entirely unnecessary -- and more importantly for this post -- the reason that the upcoming crash is going to be so insanely problematic.\n\n**Bailouts on any level, whether to companies, banks, or directly to citizens, will inevitably increase inflation. I don't think they are on the table for this correction.**\n\nPeople have painted the inflation problem as a result of supply chain issues... And while supply chain issues didn't help, I think the bigger issue, by far, was the sheer amount of money we printed. You cannot make $4 trillion appear out of thin air and expect that every dollar in circulation isn't going to suddenly become worth less money. We just lived through this reality after the Covid printing.\n\nThis will largely tie the feds hands. Print more money -- we find ourselves in a cycle of ever increasing prices and higher interest rates.\n\n**What happens from here?**\n\nI don't know. Don't listen to me. I'm an idiot. Stock market will probably just continue to go up. I'm probably wrong about 100% of this.\n\nThe prediction in bold below is what I posted 90 days ago. I now believe the top is officially in -- that we won't see another ATH for a long time. \n\n**My Prediction? GSPC/SPY cruise up a tiny bit further, to +/- $5900/$590 -- before retreating to $3500/$350 by 12/2025.**\n\nMy positions: \n\nBought 50 $570 10/2 puts at open this morning right at open. I'm up about 18k on them.   \nBought 12 $565 10/1 puts at 9:30 CST. I am up about $80 on them.   \nBought 35 UVXY $42 Calls exp 10/4 at about 10AM CST.

    "selftext": "#Good morning traders and investors of the r/stocks sub! Welcome to the new trading day and a fresh start! Here are your pre-market stock movers & news on this Wednesday, September the 18th, 2024-\n\n*****\n\n# [Stock futures rise slightly as traders debate how big the Fed\u2019s anticipated rate cut will be: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/17/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)\n\n*****\n> Stock futures rose slightly Wednesday as Wall Street anticipated the first Federal Reserve interest rate cut in four years. Gains were muted as uncertainty lingered over how big the easing will be from the central bank.\n*****\n> Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 36 points, or 0.1%. S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq-100 futures advanced 0.2% each.\n*****\n> The Fed is expected to deliver its latest policy decision at 2 p.m. ET. The central bank is expected to lower rates by at least a quarter percentage point, but traders are divided over how big the reduction will be. CME Group\u2019s FedWatch tool shows traders pricing in a 65% chance of a half-point cut and 35% odds of a quarter-point move.\n*****\n> It\u2019s unusual to have this much uncertainty into a Fed decision as the central bank typically tries to telegraph its next move to the markets. Traders had believed for most of the last month that the Fed would lower by a quarter point, but the idea of a super-sized cut began to gain traction in the past week.\n*****\n> \u201cYou\u2019d have to go back over 15 years to find such an uncertain situation this close to the decision. A lot of money will be made and lost today,\u201d Jim Reid, Deutsche Bank head of global economics and thematic research, wrote in a Wednesday note.\n*****\n> The ushering in of a cutting cycle is expected to shore up a stalling economy and further boost an already strong market, with the S&P 500 at a record following an 18% gain this year. The benchmark has averaged gains of about 16% in the 12 months following the first cut, according to data from Canaccord Genuity.\n*****\n> Despite these market expectations, some investors remain cautious about cutting rates too much, too soon. Peter Cecchini, Axonic Capital\u2019s director of research, called a 50 basis point cut \u201cunusual\u201d as the first move in a cutting cycle from the Fed given the current state of the housing market.\n*****\n> \u201cThis is not really the environment where I think the Fed needs to do a 50 basis point cut as a preemptive measure, when historically it\u2019s never done so,\u201d he told CNBC\u2019s \u201cClosing Bell\u201d on Tuesday.\n*****\n> Wall Street is coming off a mixed session that saw the S&P 500 edge up 0.03% after notching another all-time high during intraday trading. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost nearly 16 points, while the Nasdaq Composite added 0.2%.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/mUI23yj.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx?t=sec_all)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S S&P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/XSW2xch.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/v6syxBU.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/dmrCLOI.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/G9jtrZ5.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/euNdaQh.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/L4mNSBX.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/PtDvqSz.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/jw721Om.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS AFTERNOON'S AFTER-HOURS EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/6iFBim8.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/bQYOqRG.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/IcLUTzw.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/GI8msz2.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/VXRxfkP.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/ywNnpS8.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/18/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-premarket-x-vfc-rmd-msft-and-more.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n> **United States Steel** \u2014 Shares advanced more than 3% after Reuters reported the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States granted a request to push back a review of Nippon Steel\u2019s bid for U.S. Steel until after the November election.

Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 131 points, or 0.3%.\n*****\n> Microsoft rose 2% after the tech giant hiked its quarterly dividend by 10.7% to 83 cents per share. The company also approved a $60 billion buyback program.\n*****\n> Intel shares popped about 7% in premarket trading after the company said it plans to make its foundry business a subsidiary. The Biden administration also awarded the company up to $3 billion in funding through the Chips Act.\n*****\n> Investors on Tuesday will parse retail sales data for August for one final glimpse into the health of the U.S. consumer ahead of the Fed rate decision. Economists polled by Dow Jones are bracing for a 0.2% decline. Excluding autos, they see a 0.2% gain. The results could affect the rate cut outcome.\n*****\n> Wall Street is on standby for the Fed\u2019s long-anticipated rate cut, a move that could help boost earnings growth for companies following a backdrop of steep borrowing costs and high inflation. The Fed first embarked on its aggressive hiking campaign in March 2022.\n*****\n> While Wall Street expects a cut Wednesday, the market is divided on the size of the potential reduction. Traders are currently pricing in a 67% chance that the central bank eases rates by 50 basis points, according to CME Group\u2019s Fed Watch tool. That\u2019s up from a roughly 47% chance Friday.\n*****\n> \u201cMarket expectations are split between a 25 basis point and a 50 basis point rate cut, as the decision is complicated by conflicting signals of solid economic activity but a weakening labor market,\u201d said Principal Asset Management\u2019s Seema Shah. \u201cRarely have market expectations been so torn, so close to a [Federal Open Market Committee] meeting.\u201d\n*****\n> While a 50 basis point cut isn\u2019t out of the question, the chief global strategist thinks that the Fed should take a more cautious approach to cutting and ease rates by 25 basis points.

    "selftext": "So over years, I've been gathering over 50 stocks. Of course, some have performed great, largely because my timing, mid-2022, was an excellent entry point. But of course, I can't help brag about my selection choice. For example, Qualcomm, AMD, JPM, MSFT, GOOG, Citi.\n\nI (think), I hit most of the semiconductor names, except NVDA. For some reason, it never felt like a good investment. I have my skepticism about LLMs and Gen-AI hype. Besides, generating cat pics or idle plays with Chat-GPT, I haven't\u00a0***yet***\u00a0seen a business effectively using Gen-AI as a compelling competitive edge. So, please educate me here as well. AMD is different because of data center servers product line - which is more solid story.\n\nBesides missing such obvious biggies, not all of what I touched has performed. I felt, European carmakers (BMW, VW, MBG) were deep value at PE 3-5 and 8-9% yields, but obviously I was wrong. They were cheap for a reason.\n\n**Main question**\u00a0- I was wondering if I can do a simulation of hypothetical scenario where I had simply invested in index, saving me enormous time in research. If so, please suggest tools/sites?\n\nNote that the amounts and time of entry/exit are not constant, so I can't use the simple lumpsum or periodic investing calculators that assume regular constant amounts and intervals.\n\nWith 50 stocks in my portfolio, I wonder if it is just mirroring the index, or generating any real alpha. Obviously, when I buy something, I am highly convinced of my reasonings. So, it's hard to part with what I feel are \"my gems\". How do you cope with these emotional aspects of investing?",

    "title": "The Consumer Recession of 2023-2024 and the Future",
    "selftext": "Alright so this going to be a long post so bear with me. I think we are currently in a consumer recession right now. Now you\u2019re probably thinking ok but how? GDP continues to grow, unemployment continues to be stable, and the market is higher than ever right now. I am going to talk about some companies here that will hopefully give support to my theory.  \n\n1. Microsoft (MSFT)\n\nNow you\u2019re probably wondering why this is the first company I am bringing up when Microsoft grew revenue and income. Microsoft grew revenue by 10% and net income by 20%. Microsoft does both software and hardware. The software parts of the business like Office, Cloud, and Services increased substantially. However when you look at the hardware side of the business it paints a different picture. \n\nDevice revenue decreased 20%. These are things like personal computers, accessories, and other electronics that Microsoft sells and this part of their business declined considerably. Gaming revenue decreased by 5% with Xbox hardware sales falling 11%. We are currently seeing a similar trend in 2024. People are pulling back on items like PCs and gaming consoles. \n\nNow you\u2019re probably thinking \u201cyeah random redditor not everybody buys PCs/Xboxs every year. This means nothing.\u201d \n\nSo now we go to our next company. \n\n2. Apple\n\nLike Microsoft Apple is a big tech company that is integrated into our society and the every day consumer. If you don\u2019t personally use them you know someone who uses their products. If we look at Apples results in 2023 and we look at product sales they declined from 316.1 billion to 298 billion. Hardware sales were down across the board. Macs, iPhones, iPads, and Wearables all declined. However no what didn\u2019t decline? Services. Like Microsoft services grew for Apple from 78.1 billion to 85.2 billion. Once again we are seeing this pattern of physical products that appeal to the middle class consumer fall. \n\nNow you\u2019re probably thinking \u201cyeah random redditor but Apple isn\u2019t cool anymore so of course their products are not selling. So that makes no sense and means nothing in the grand scheme of things.\u201d Ok let\u2019s keep going. \n\n3. Nike\n\nNike is a global fashion and one of the biggest in the world if not the biggest. Like Apple if you don\u2019t use their products you personally know someone who uses them. They\u2019re everywhere. Nike reported a decline in revenue by 2% in 2024 and is currently forecasting a 10% drop in Q1 2025 and a drop for the full year of 2025. We saw Nike report product declines like their shoes in 2024 and it\u2019s expected to get worse in 2025. The stock is currently sitting at a multi year low and besides Covid these levels haven\u2019t been seen since 2018.\n\nNow you\u2019re probably thinking \u201cok random redditor but Nike isn\u2019t cool anymore and Adidas is better and sells more track suits to the Eastern Europeans. So it makes sense why it\u2019s down.\u201d Ok lets look at more. \n\n4. Home Depot and Lowe\u2019s\n\nThe two home building retailer giants of the US. If you own a home or have done work on your home you\u2019re familiar with these 2 companies. These 2 companies are staples to the entire US economy. Similar to UPS and FedEx if you want to get a general look at how the economy is doing you\u2019re paying attention to these two companies as they\u2019re crucial to its health. In 2023 we saw Home Depots sales decrease by 3% and earnings decrease by 9.5%. We just saw Home Depot recently report their earnings and according to them they expect more pain as the consumer continues to pullback. We saw a similar result for Lowe\u2019s. They reported a net sales decrease of 11% and are forecasting another sales decrease in 2024. With expectations being another 2-3% fall in comparable sales. \n\nBoth Home Depot and Lowe\u2019s stock are still down from their highs in 2021. Home Depot is down 16% and Lowe\u2019s down 10% which was close to 3 years ago. \n\nNow you\u2019re probably thinking \u201cok random redditor but those are boomer companies nobody cares about.\u201d Ok how about another one. \n\n5. Target \n\nTarget is a company that you know well cause you either have a mom or a girlfriend or both who spends their day there. Target is the upperclass Walmart that is a bit more luxurious and like all the other companies I mention they appeal to the middle/high class. \n\nIn 2023 Target reported a sales decline of 1.7% and a comparable sales decline of 3.7%. Full year revenue decreased by 1.7%. The company going forward is expecting a continued consumer pullback and is expecting either flat or declines. Target stock is currently down 48% from its high with its high being in 2021. \n\nI can really keep going with this. Here is some more. \n\n1. Estee Lauder: massive stock decline\n\n2. Ulta Beauty: massive stock decline\n\n3. UPS (a crucial economic stock): massive stock decline\n\n4. Lululemon: massive stock decline\n\n5. Dollar General: massive stock decline\n\n6. Hershey: massive stock decline \n\n7. Starbucks: massive stock decline\n\nNow what is the point of all of this and all these companies mentioned and talked about? These are all companies that sell a semi luxury product that appeals to the middle class consumer. Now we are seeing the middle class  consumer pull back on these products. Maybe you\u2019re not buying the next Microsoft PC this year, or the new iPhone, or the new pair of Nike sneakers due to rising costs in other areas. This is causing the market to price in future bad results and causing the stock price to crash. \n\nWe are seeing a case where the market is not reflecting the economy. Businesses all across various industries are showing declines across the board and it\u2019s only expected to get worse. Now with all these declines in other industries why is the market so high? The answer is tech. Companies like Nvidia, Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Apple, Meta, Broadcom, Qualcomm, AMD, etc. are dominating the market. With these stocks continuing to increase and other stocks continuing to decrease it\u2019s only getting worse. They have a heavy weight on the indexes and they\u2019re causing most of the gains in the index while we are seeing other sectors decline. \n\nThis has caused tech valuations to soar and other areas of the market to lag. Now what does this mean going forward. Are we due for a massive decline in the market where we see tech finally come down? \n\nI personally don\u2019t think so. However I think going forward we won\u2019t see the returns that tech has given now going forward. I think these stock declines in the market has presented opportunities and we can possibly see a sector rotation. For example the Fed cutting rates and alleviating pressure on the consumer. A case where tech lags behind and we see other areas of the market which have fallen start to climb. I could be wrong on this but these are just my thoughts. Let me know what you think about this theory.",

When do you think the market will bottom out and I can go in? \n\nOr maybe the bottom is now. rips.\n\nEdit: yea it was a bad idea.  \nGood thing is I live in a country with no capital gains tax(only the 15% us dividend tax), and my account is like 3.5k.\n\nDecided to buy back in a little too late... looking at the huge berkshire drop though.",

    "title": "Analyzing the Analysts: Using average analyst price target to identify buying opportunities amongst the top 100 companies in the S&P",
    "selftext": "Hello everyone,\n\nI'm a lazy investor and don't like to do much due diligence, but I do like to make money. Unfortunately these two things about me are often at odds as I've lost money in the past for not doing my DD. As such, I continue to be lazy but I try and find ways to work around doing due diligence and hopefully finding loop holes.\n\nOne such way that I have been thinking about recently is using analyst ratings, reviews and price targets as a surrogate for due diligence. In essence, I try to just have these analysts do the work for me. The idea is that much in the same way that with those who believe in technical analysis hold that everything you need to know about a stock is baked into it's price action, and so when something good happens the stock price goes up and when something bad happens the stock price goes down, thus all you need is to analyze trends in stock price and you'll be analyzing everything about the stock by proxy, I have a thesis (or theory) that perhaps you can do the same or something similar with analyst price targets of companies.\n\nNow I know that anyone who has read this far already thinks I'm an idiot. Many experienced individual investors probably find market analysts to be stupid and therefore I'm stupid for following their lead, but I would argue to the contrary for a few reasons. As much as I have put in a lot of effort to learn about how the market operates (been investing for the last 6 years, started learning actively about it as much as I could a couple years prior to that), there is still much I don't know as I don't have a finance or economics degree. Moreover, as bad as you may think an analyst is, they are at least competent enough to keep their job as an analyst at the investment firm that allows them to make stock price target selections. Lastly, and most importantly, what I am about to discuss below uses the aggregate of numerous analyst price targets so I'm not relying on a single analyst, but several (probably between 10 and 40 per company). I think if two-dozen analysts are strongly in favor of a company, it is unlikely that my novice investor wisdom would have researched the company and found a flaw that they all missed.\n\nSo what I did yesterday evening was go through the top 100 S&P 500 companies by market cap and find the current average price target for them on Yahoo Finance. I then divided the current stock price (at the close on 7/31) by that price target and expressed it as a percentage to see how far off the company was from the average price target analysts were aiming for. Then I also listed how many total ratings each company had, and how many of them were 'Strong Buys' and 'Buys'.\n\nThis yielded the following table:\n\n|+|A|B|C|D|E|F|G|H|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|1|Company|Current Price|Price Target|Percent to Target|Total Ratings|# Strong Buy Ratings|# Buy Ratings|% of Ratings that were Strong Buys|\n|2|AAPL|222.08|209.76|105.87%|38|11|21|28.95%|\n|3|MSFT|418.35|459.66|91.01%|34|14|13|41.18%|\n|4|NVDA|117.02|125.69|93.10%|38|14|15|36.84%|\n|5|AMZN|186.98|206.43|90.58%|47|15|28|31.91%|\n|6|META|474.83|490.04|96.90%|63|21|34|33.33%|\n|7|GOOG|173.15|185.45|93.37%|5|0|3|0.00%|\n|8|BRK.B|438.5|441.47|99.33%|6|1|3|16.67%|\n|9|LLY|804.27|817.03|98.44%|22|9|8|40.91%|\n|10|AVGO|160.68|180.62|88.96%|29|10|17|34.48%|\n|11|JPM|212.8|200.66|106.05%|28|9|13|32.14%|\n|12|TSLA|232.07|189.09|122.73%|23|0|0|0.00%|\n|13|UNH|576.16|569.6|101.15%|22|11|11|50.00%|\n|14|XOM|118.59|122.83|96.55%|25|5|11|20.00%|\n|15|V|265.67|282.26|94.12%|39|13|22|33.33%|\n|16|JNJ|157.85|158.53|99.57%|23|4|8|17.39%|\n|17|PG|160.76|161.5|99.54%|22|6|4|27.27%|\n|18|MA|463.71|474.87|97.65%|39|14|20|35.90%|\n|19|HD|368.16|355.97|103.42%|33|12|12|36.36%|\n|20|COST|822|886.84|92.69%|29|7|11|24.14%|\n|21|WMT|68.64|68.29|100.51%|32|8|7|25.00%|\n|22|MRK|113.13|132.14|85.61%|21|4|7|19.05%|\n|23|BAC|40.31|41.95|96.09%|30|6|16|20.00%|\n|24|CVX|160.47|167.84|95.61%|24|6|10|25.00%|\n|25|NFLX|628.35|640.43|98.11%|41|11|14|26.83%|\n|26|KO|66.74|64.8|102.99%|25|5|7|20.00%|\n|27|CRM|258.8|274.18|94.39%|45|16|25|35.56%|\n|28|ADBE|551.65|566.58|97.36%|31|11|14|35.48%|\n|29|PEP|172.67|168.65|102.38%|22|10|10|45.45%|\n|30|TMO|613.34|629.42|97.45%|15|8|6|53.33%|\n|31|AMD|144.48|175.48|82.33%|31| | |0.00%|\n|32|LIN|453.5|475.32|95.41%| | | |#DIV/0!|\n|33|ORCL|139.45|140.03|99.59%|36|10|16|27.78%|\n|34|WFC|59.34|59.8|99.23%|31|4|8|12.90%|\n|35|ACN|330.62|348.01|95.00%|29|7|9|24.14%|\n|36|CSCO|48.45|50.56|95.83%|27|8|11|29.63%|\n|37|MCD|265.4|276.47|96.00%|33|8|15|24.24%|\n|38|QCOM|180.95|191.24|94.62%|23|2|7|8.70%|\n|39|GE|170.2|171.93|98.99%|17|5| |29.41%|\n|40|ABT|105.94|124.37|85.18%|20|7|6|35.00%|\n|41|TXN|203.81|187.18|108.88%|32|6|8|18.75%|\n|42|DHR|277.08|284.09|97.53%|17|7|6|41.18%|\n|43|AMGN|332.47|320.24|103.82%|25|3|7|12.00%|\n|44|INTU|647.35|711.36|91.00%|22|6|3|27.27%|\n|45|PM|115.16|115.74|99.50%|18|2|7|11.11%|\n|46|PFE|30.54|29.38|103.95%|22|2|11|9.09%|\n|47|IBM|192.14|172.59|111.33%|25|4|4|16.00%|\n|48|DIS|93.69|123.11|76.10%|30|5|10|16.67%|\n|49|VZ|40.52|45.6|88.86%|32|2|6|6.25%|\n|50|CAT|346.2|337.62|102.54%|24|4|7|16.67%|\n|51|NOW|814.39|807.1|100.90%|34|13|17|38.24%|\n|52|AMAT|212.2|248.8|85.29%|21|4|15|19.05%|\n|53|GS|509.03|476.64|106.80%|27|4|7|14.81%|\n|54|CMCSA|41.27|46.36|89.02%|31|12|18|38.71%|\n|55|SPGI|484.73|521.39|92.97%|15|1|9|6.67%|\n|56|RTX|117.49|103.93|113.05%| | | |#DIV/0!|\n|57|ISRG|444.61|471.87|94.22%|17|6|5|35.29%|\n|58|NEE|76.39|80.23|95.21%|15|5|8|33.33%|\n|59|UNP|246.73|242.11|101.91%|29|5|7|17.24%|\n|60|AXP|253.04|253.26|99.91%|28|6|4|21.43%|\n|61|LOW|245.51|250.99|97.82%|32|8|10|25.00%|\n|62|T|19.25|19.3|99.74%|30|6|3|20.00%|\n|63|HON|204.75|226.96|90.21%|20|7|9|35.00%|\n|64|UBER|64.47|79.96|80.63%| | | |#DIV/0!|\n|65|VRTX|495.72|483.91|102.44%|27|10|12|37.04%|\n|66|MS|103.21|105.64|97.70%|27|3|14|11.11%|\n|67|TJX|113.02|107.04|105.59%|27|9|14|33.33%|\n|68|INTC|30.74|38.02|80.85%|41| |18|0.00%|\n|69|BKNG|3715.01|4192.39|88.61%| | | |#DIV/0!|\n|70|PGR|214.12|237.47|90.17%|19|5|4|26.32%|\n|71|C|64.88|71.01|91.37%|29|5|12|17.24%|\n|72|ELV|532.03|599.13|88.80%| | | |#DIV/0!|\n|73|BLK|876.5|936.85|93.56%|15|3|9|20.00%|\n|74|PLD|126.05|135.68|92.90%|18|4|8|22.22%|\n|75|LMT|541.92|535.31|101.23%|22|7| |31.82%|\n|76|ETN|304.79|345.86|88.13%|24|3|4|12.50%|\n|77|REGN|1079.19|1104.34|97.72%|26|7|6|26.92%|\n|78|MU|109.82|174.41|62.97%|31|8|20|25.81%|\n|79|CB|275.66|277.84|99.22%|19|5|11|26.32%|\n|80|SYK|327.45|378.81|86.44%|27|11|6|40.74%|\n|81|ADI|231.38|255.84|90.44%|26|6|10|23.08%|\n|82|LRCX|921.24|1041.75|88.43%|19|3|12|15.79%|\n|83|MMC|222.57|223.48|99.59%|19|4|7|21.05%|\n|84|BSX|73.88|87.57|84.37%|24|10|8|41.67%|\n|85|MDT|80.32|92.43|86.90%|23|4|7|17.39%|\n|86|BA|190.6|219.35|86.89%|25|7|7|28.00%|\n|87|ADP|262.62|264.65|99.23%|18|1|1|5.56%|\n|88|AMT|220.4|230.39|95.66%|22|7|14|31.82%|\n|89|PANW|324.73|343.43|94.55%|41|13|16|31.71%|\n|90|KLAC|823.07|868.07|94.82%|14|2|4|14.29%|\n|91|BX|142.15|135.47|104.93%|14|6|6|42.86%|\n|92|CI|348.67|393.25|88.66%|17|6|7|35.29%|\n|93|BMY|47.56|50.47|94.23%|22|5|4|22.73%|\n|94|GILD|76.06|81.02|93.88%|28|2|11|7.14%|\n|95|SCHW|65.19|73.89|88.23%|19|5|9|26.32%|\n|96|DE|371.98|422.99|87.94%|22|4|3|18.18%|\n|97|FI|163.57|177.14|92.34%|19|1|2|5.26%|\n|98|UPS|130.37|144.61|90.15%|26|3|2|11.54%|\n|99|SO|83.52|79.51|105.04%|17|1|4|5.88%|\n|100|TMUS|182.28|197.95|92.08%|30|7|16|23.33%|\n|101|COP|111.2|141.51|78.58%|21|6|9|28.57%|\n\n\nBased on this table above, I tried to identify some companies that met a few criteria.

    "selftext": "The three major U.S. averages on Wednesday ended solidly higher, after Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell said an interest rate cut \"could be on the table as soon as September\" if data on inflation and the labor market continued to improve.\nPowell's remarks, along with a powerful rebound in chip stocks, helped the Nasdaq Composite (COMP:IND) and the benchmark S&P 500 (SP500) post their best intraday gain each since February 22.\n\n\nThe Nasdaq Composite climbed 2.64% to settle at 17,599.40 points, while the S&P 500 closed out the final day of the month with an advance of 1.58% to 5,522.30 points. The blue-chip Dow (DJI) added 0.24% to conclude at 40,843.06 points.\n\n\nU.S. Treasury yields moved lower after Powell's comments, as traders snapped up bonds. The longer-end 10-year yield (US10Y) fell to its lowest level since March, dropping 7 basis points to 4.032%.\n\nEarlier, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) held the federal funds rate steady at 5.25%-5.50%, a largely given outcome.\n\n\nThe attention was on Powell's post-decision press conference, amid hopes that the central bank chief would talk about interest rate cuts in September. And Powell did not disappoint.\n\n\nHe signaled that policymakers could be considering an interest rate cut as soon as September if they continued to see inflation moving quickly or in line with their expectations, growth remaining reasonably strong and the labor market staying consistent with its current conditions.\n\n\nAccording to the CME FedWatch tool, the odds of a 50 basis point rate cut in September climbed after Powell's comments, underscoring the market's confidence that the monetary policy easing cycle was imminent. There is now a 90.5% chance of a 25 bp cut, a 9.5% chance of a 50 bp cut, and a 0.0% chance of a 0 bp cut.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) surged 17%, after Morgan Stanley re-added the chip giant to its top picks list following the stock's recent selloff. In addition, Microsoft and Meta reiterated and increased their capital expenditure investments, signaling further revenue upside for Nvidia. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) climbed 4%, after the world's second-largest maker of personal computer processors issued current quarter revenue guidance that was above consensus estimates.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) slipped 1%, after the tech behemoth's cloud business missed on revenue and its quarterly capital expenditure swelled to $19B.\n\n\nTurning to Wednesday's economic calendar, ADP's jobs report before the opening bell showed private sector employment growing by 122K in July, significantly lower than the consensus figure of 154K. Shortly after, a key gauge of Q2 U.S. labor costs rose lesser than anticipated while also slowing down from the previous quarter.",

    "selftext": "Microsoft shares fell 7% in extended trading on Tuesday after the software company reported disappointing cloud revenue, overshadowing stronger earnings and revenue than analysts had predicted.\n\nHere\u2019s how the company did, compared with the LSEG consensus:\n\nEarnings per share: $2.95 vs. $2.93 expected\n\nRevenue: $64.73 billion vs. $64.39 billion expected\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s revenue increased 15% year over year in the fiscal fourth quarter, which ended on June 30, according to a statement. Net income, at $22.04 billion, was up from $20.08 billion, or $2.69 per share, in the year-ago quarter.\n\nRevenue from Azure and other cloud services grew 29% during the quarter. Analysts polled by CNBC and StreetAccount had expected 31% growth. Microsoft doesn\u2019t disclose revenue from the category in dollars. Last week Google parent Alphabet said revenue from its cloud business, encompassing Workspace productivity software and Google Cloud Platform infrastructure, went up by about 29%. \n\nDuring the fiscal fourth quarter, Microsoft started selling Surface PCs with AI features that can run certain models locally without the need for an internet connection. Dell, HP and other device makers also touted their own so-called Copilot+ PCs. CEO Satya Nadella said at a press briefing in May that \u201cwe\u2019re bringing real joy and a sense of wonder back to creation on the PC.\u201d\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/30/microsoft-msft-q4-earnings-report-2024.html",

Of course if I never sold 1,000 shares I'd be up like $500k but it's risky.

The company has a strong competitive position, over 11tn in assets under management, and an healthy PE of 20. I think that growth is likely to continue, (rising valuations, launch on new blackrock ETFs, service expansion) and their position is too dominant to be disrupted. I am not sure of their pricing power though, their ETFs clients are very sensitive, but at that scale they should fund a way to monetize (revenue is around 0.17% of their AUM). I don't see much risk, except for valuation, but I would like to hear different opinion and see if I am missing something.",

    "selftext": "I got to try Microsoft's copilot this week and i have to say i was underwhelmed by what it had to offer. It just felt like an enhancement for windows with more features, nothing ground breaking. This wasn't a major leap in technology like going from fax's to email. Tech companies releasing new (free)upgrades and new (free)products is like Nike releasing a new pair of shoes, just something else to add to the lineup. Will it make SOME peoples jobs more efficient, yes. Is it applicable for most people, i have to say no. Nike makes shoes for athletes but maybe 1-2% actually use them for what its intended for. Lets say a company has 20,000 employees, of those employees how many need it for their role or will using it on a daily basis? Maybe 90 % wont. If that's accurate a company will only pay for the 10% that need a user license.\n\nIf chat GPT was never released all the mag 7 earnings would still be about the same without it.\n\nNow for the overvalued and overbought. MSFT has a PE of 40, one of the highest of all the mag 7. Your paying $40 for every dollar they earn. Based on their current AI stack im not sure they will be able to beat the current expectations in a big way consistently. MSFT is not NVDA. NVDA chips cost $30k+ each, as much as a low end Tesla. Copilot has a free version and the pro version is $20-$30 per user. Most people at companies are not using this and im not sure this will add to the bottom line very much. That means most of the earnings growth will have to come from the cloud business, admittedly the cloud business has been growing at double digits for a long time but there is also a lot of competition in cloud space, at some point growth will slow as cap ex spending slows. The other thing to consider is what AI costs for these companies. The GPU's are expensive, Data storage is expensive and the energy demand from AI use is very very expensive. At some point AI use, especially from free users is going to eat into the profit margins.\n\nMSFT right now is like buying a over priced Cadillac, yeah it drives nice but its overpriced.\n\nAAPL is also overvalued at 35x earnings. Adding chatGPT to a smartphone and enhancing siri isn't worth the current valuation. The goggles were a bust. No new products on the horizon just same stuff just newer versions. Apple isn't the glamorous high growth tech company it once was. Iphones sales are falling off in China and this will definitely show in the next couple quarters of earnings. Its the Nike of tech stocks. People aren't spending $100 for shoes they certainly wont spend $900+ for a phone. I wouldn't be surprised if Buffet starts to offload shares at this PE ratio.\n\nThat fourth industrial revolution is not happening today or tomorrow, we are too early. This is going to take some time.\n\nI agree with Ken Griffin on this, the current AI products on the market are not the revolution many are hoping for, they're mediocre at best. There's too much spending and too much free products for this to add to any company's bottom line. The real winners are semi's, data storage and anything surrounding it. \n\n[https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/01/ken-griffin-says-hes-not-convinced-ai-will-replace-human-jobs-in-near-future.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/01/ken-griffin-says-hes-not-convinced-ai-will-replace-human-jobs-in-near-future.html)\n\nThere is one area that will benefit astronomically from AI but that will come a bit later.",

    "title": "Nvidia to get 20% weighting and billions in investor demand, while Apple demoted in major tech fund",
    "selftext": "KEY POINTS\n\n* Microsoft and Nvidia will likely have a weight of around 21% in this tech ETF, while Apple will be down to about 4.5%, according to Matthew Bartolini, head of SPDR Americas Research.\n* The rebalance will be in effect for one quarter, even if Apple outperforms Nvidia significantly ahead of the official date.\n* The ETF has about $71 billion in assets under management, so a 15-percentage-point change in the fund equates to more than $10 billion.\n\n\n\n[Nvidia](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/NVDA/)\u2019s blistering rally will force a major technology exchange-traded fund to acquire more than $10 billion worth of shares of the chip giant while cutting dramatically back on\u00a0[Apple](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AAPL/).\n\nThe index that the\u00a0[Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK)](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/XLK/)\u00a0follows will soon rebalance, based on an adjusted market cap value from Friday\u2019s close. The new calculations show\u00a0[Microsoft](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/MSFT/)\u00a0as the top stock in the index, followed by Nvidia and then Apple, according to Matthew Bartolini, head of SPDR Americas Research.\n\nAll three stocks would have a weight above 20% in the index if there were not caps in place. But diversification rules for the index limit how big the cumulative weight of stocks with at least a 5% share of the fund can be.\n\nAs a result, Microsoft and Nvidia will likely have a weight of around 21%, while Apple will fall sharply to about 4.5%, Bartolini said.\n\nThat is a change from the prior weightings, which saw Nvidia\u2019s weight be kept artificially low by index rules. As of June 14, Microsoft and Apple were both at about 22% each in the fund, while Nvidia was just 6%.\n\n  \nThe race to finish in the top two came down to the final day. As of Monday, market cap data from FactSet shows that all three companies are over $3.2 trillion and within $50 million of each other, though that data does differ slightly from the calculations used in the index.\n\nThe XLK has about $71 billion in assets under management, so a 15-percentage-point change in the fund equates to more than $10 billion. SPDR does not comment on specific trading strategies around rebalances.\n\nThe big shift in the XLK is an extreme example of how even passive index funds can diverge, especially when focusing on narrow slices of the market.\n\n\u201cUnderstanding how they might be weighted, where they\u2019re allocated, what the rebalance frequency is, is really important because it can create differences in exposures and make what\u2019s beneath the label seem different from fund to fund,\u201d Bartolini said.\n\nThe fund follows the Technology Select Sector Index from S&P Dow Jones Indices, which uses a float-adjusted calculation to determine market cap. The rebalance officially takes effect at the end of this week.\n\nThe free-float adjustment for market cap accounts for large holders of an individual stock that are unlikely to be trading on a daily basis. For example, Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway owns more than 5% of Apple, which could count against it in the index, Bartolini said.\n\n\u201cIts free-float market capitalization is reduced because you have so many controlled interests in the company,\u201d Bartolini said.\n\nThe rebalance will be in effect for one quarter, even if Apple outperforms Nvidia significantly ahead of the official date.\n\nOn Monday, shares of Apple were up 1.8%, while Nvidia ticked up 0.2%.\n\n[https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/17/nvidia-to-get-20percent-weighting-and-billions-in-investor-demand-while-apple-demoted-in-major-tech-fund.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/17/nvidia-to-get-20percent-weighting-and-billions-in-investor-demand-while-apple-demoted-in-major-tech-fund.html)",

    "selftext": "Riding the MSFT Rocket \ud83d\ude80\u00a0\n\nAlright, here\u2019s 2 cents on MSFT\u00a0\n\n**Current Play**\u00a0\n\nMSFT is hanging out at $427.87, flirting just below its recent peak of $433.60. The 50-day moving average is chillin' at $414.55, while the 200-day is holding down at $395.67. Volume\u2019s spiking, and you know what that means someone's loading up heavy!\u00a0\n\n**Analyst Chatter**\u00a0\n\n**Analysts are bullish on Microsoft:**\u00a0\n\n* Goldman Sachs reaffirmed their \u201cbuy\u201d rating with a target of $460.\u00a0\n* Morgan Stanley is rating it \u201coverweight,\u201d targeting $450.\u00a0\n* JP Morgan set a $455 target, taking a neutral stance.\u00a0\n* Barclays raised their target to $470, maintaining a \u201cbuy.\u201d\u00a0\n* Credit Suisse is holding steady with a $445 target.\u00a0\n\nOverall, 30 out of 35 analysts recommend a \u201cbuy,\u201d with an average target around $460. The general sentiment is bullish, focusing on Microsoft\u2019s advancements in AI and cloud computing.\u00a0\n\n**Financial Pulse**\u00a0\n\n**Microsoft\u2019s financials are rock solid:**\u00a0\n\n* Earnings Per Share came in at $11.01, beating expectations.\u00a0\n* Revenue: $56.2 billion, up 11.3% year-over-year. Big boy numbers.\u00a0\n\n**Key ratios to note:**\u00a0\n\n* Debt-to-Equity Ratio: 0.40.\u00a0\n* Profit Margin: 33%.\u00a0\n* Return on Equity: 35%.\u00a0\n\nThese figures highlight Microsoft\u2019s robust growth and profitability.\u00a0\n\n**Insider Moves**\u00a0\n\n**There\u2019s been some notable insider trading:**\u00a0\n\n* Satya Nadella, CEO, sold 59,907 shares in May, likely cashing in on gains.\u00a0\n* Amy Hood, CFO, sold 20,000 shares. Total insider sales have reached about $40 million in the past quarter.\u00a0\n\nDespite these sales, insiders still hold significant shares, signaling continued confidence.\u00a0\n\nInstitutional Maneuvers\u00a0\n\n**Big institutional players are bullish:**\u00a0\n\n* BlackRock added 1.2 million shares.\u00a0\n* Vanguard Group increased their stake significantly.\u00a0\n* Renaissance Technologies boosted their position by 5%.\u00a0\n* T. Rowe Price now holds $6.5 billion worth of MSFT shares.\u00a0\n\nThese moves show strong institutional confidence in Microsoft\u2019s future.\u00a0\n\n**Major News and Tech Developments**\u00a0\n\n**Several key developments are pushing Microsoft forward:**\u00a0\n\n**AI and Cloud Expansion:** Microsoft is aggressively expanding its AI and cloud capabilities. They\u2019ve introduced Copilot, an AI-driven tool within Microsoft 365, which automates routine tasks and provides advanced analytics. This tool is expected to enhance user productivity significantly.\u00a0\n\n**OpenAI Partnership**: Their deepening partnership with OpenAI is a major catalyst. Integrating advanced AI models from OpenAI into Azure positions Microsoft as a leader in AI-as-a-service. They\u2019ve also launched ChatGPT Enterprise, offering secure and scalable AI solutions for businesses.\u00a0\n\n**Quantum Computing:** Microsoft\u2019s investment in quantum computing through Azure Quantum is promising. This technology is expected to tackle complex problems more efficiently than classical computing, potentially revolutionizing fields like logistics, cryptography, and pharmaceuticals.\u00a0\n\n**AI Hardware Advances:** Microsoft is working on a custom AI chip, Athena, to enhance AI applications\u2019 performance across their cloud infrastructure. This should reduce reliance on third-party chips and lower costs.\u00a0\n\n**Cloud Services Growth:** Azure\u2019s growth continues, driven by new enterprise customers and expanded services in data analytics and cybersecurity. Microsoft\u2019s cloud services are pivotal for the digital transformation of businesses worldwide.\u00a0\n\n# Apple\u2019s Flop\n\nApple just had an epic fail, folks. Their AI event was a total disaster, and it\u2019s got people rethinking their game plan. Here\u2019s the tea:\n\n* **Lackluster AI Unveil:** Apple tried to flex their new AI features, but it was a major letdown. They barely brought anything new to the table. The crowd reaction was like, \u201cSeriously, Apple? That\u2019s it?\u201d\n* **Tech Flops:** The live demo was a nightmare. Siri couldn\u2019t handle basic commands without lagging or outright failing. Imagine trying to show off your new tech, and it glitches right in front of everyone. Cringe city.\n* **Market Reaction:** Investors weren\u2019t having it. Apple\u2019s stock took a 3% dive today as people dumped shares faster than you can say \u201cAI fail.\u201d Wall Street\u2019s questioning whether Apple can even hang in the AI race now.\n* **Missed Opportunities:** Apple didn\u2019t announce any major AI collaborations or breakthroughs, leaving the impression that they\u2019re playing catch-up instead of leading the charge.\n* **Consumer Backlash:** Social media is roasting Apple\u2019s presentation, with memes and complaints about how underwhelming it was. Not the kind of viral you want.\n\nLooks like Microsoft is poised to steal the AI crown while Apple scrambles to get their act together. With MSFT\u2019s solid AI strategy and Apple tripping over their own feet, this is a prime time to bet on Microsoft pulling ahead.\n\n**My Strategy**\u00a0\n\n**Technical Setup:**\u00a0\n\n* 50-Day Moving Average: $414.55.\u00a0\n* 200-Day Moving Average: $395.67.\u00a0\n\n**Entry Points:**\u00a0\n\n* Short-Term: I\u2019m looking to enter around $420.00, which aligns with support and offers a solid risk/reward ratio.\u00a0\n* Long-Term: If it drops to the 50-day MA at $414.55 or below, it\u2019s a strong buy for long-term holding.\u00a0\n\n**Exit Strategy:**\u00a0\n\n* Short-Term Gains: I\u2019m targeting an exit around $460.00, in line with average analyst targets.\u00a0\n* Long-Term Hold: I\u2019m aiming for a higher exit around $470.00, which aligns with Barclays\u2019 more bullish target.\u00a0\n\n**Risk Management:**\u00a0\n\n* Monitor Financial News: I\u2019ll keep an eye on AI and cloud computing updates and any new tech releases.\u00a0\n* Adjust Stops: I\u2019ll raise the stop-loss level as the stock price rises to protect gains.\u00a0\n\n**The Bottom Line**\u00a0\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s push into AI, cloud computing, and quantum computing, combined with strategic partnerships and new tech developments, positions it well for growth. With entry points around $420.00 and exit targets between $460.00 and $470.00, MSFT looks set for solid gains. I\u2019ll stay updated on financial and tech news to maximize the potential from this trade.\u00a0\n\nHere\u2019s to making smart moves! \ud83e\udd42\u00a0\n\n\u00a0",

    "selftext": "Alphabet will excel in the AI and automation sectors, but the resulting industry shift will be a net loss for the M7 company as AI eats into its search revenue.\n\nWith the \"Attention is all you need\" paper Alphabet has already etched itself into AI history. Its cloud computing arm is keeping up with AWS and Azure. Waymo threatens to eat Tesla's lunch. Its TPU may very well knock Nvidia off its perch.\n\nBut even if all that happens, it won't make up for the losses to its search business when AI chatbots take over many of the functions of search. Despite all the efforts into diversification, more than half of Alphabet's revenue still comes from search. So if people turn to Chat-GPT instead of Google as the primary web surfing tool, Alphabet will take a big hit to its most important segment. If GPT can give me the results I want, plus summaries and links and review aggregates, all on voice command, why would I ever need to go on Google and get exposed to its sponsored results? The OAI partnership with Apple may signal the beginning of this shift.\n\nMuch of Alphabet's valuation comes from its ridiculous dominance in search. All of its other ventures face stiff competition from other M7 companies and OAI, and I have a hard time believing Alphabet will crush them the way it crushed Yahoo.\n\nUltimately, Alphabet stands to lose heavily early in the AI revolution. The company will survive, but without a massive moat in a crucial industry, it may go the way of Netflix and lose its elite status among the likes of META, MSFT, and NVDA.",

    "selftext": "So, I had an excellent ride on AAPL for a good long bit, but bit a bit Meh on it concerning it's YTD performance , and what I see as a lot of lackluster reviews of it's recent product offerings and choices.  Thinner ipad, who cares?  New chip, no software yet to take advantage of it probably for the better part of a year.  Virt Reality, no killer app to drive it.  AI, they seem to be late in their development, although Apple has always been the greatest at their catchup/surpassing game.  I think there maybe better options for me, looking for a sounding board.  Still looking to keep it in steadily plodding behemoths for ease of mind, but something better than flat YTD performance i got out of apple this year.\n\nFirst up MSFT, up 14% YTD, has a wide moat, seems to be well positioned for AI, although their gaming sector is looking kinda soft to me.  Like their latest offerings in pc with infused AI, and tablet.\n\nNext up AMZN, up 21% YTD, also a wide moat, with a lot of stability in their supplied items and businesses.  Nothing really lights up the sky, just plodding along.  I think they have an AI strength used in their background business, but has an appearance of hiding, as it has no consumer face to it.\n\nLastly NVDA, up 110% YTD.  They are definitely the star of the moment, and I think there is still gas in this tank, but being a hardware vendor mostly with some software driven solutions for AI for their platform alone, they may have locked up a good lead that will only grow.\n\nLooking at doing a 50/25/25 split (MSFT/AMZN/NVDA), thoughts?  Would love to hear any positive or negative on this.\n\n  \nedit, fixed percentage ups ytd.",

    "selftext": "STOCKHOLM, May 8 (Reuters) - Telefonica Germany\u00a0(TEF.MC) will move one million 5G customers to Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud later this month, company executives told Reuters, in a bold move by the U.S. online retailer to break into the global telecoms market.\n\nWhile some telecom networks have moved IT and other non-core operations to the public cloud, the move by the subsidiary of Spanish group Telefonica is a global first where an existing mobile operator is switching its core network to a public cloud.\n\nBig cloud-computing services firms such as Amazon\u00a0(AMZN.O) and Microsoft\u00a0(MSFT.O) have been trying to move more into the telecoms sector, lured by billions of dollars in potential revenue, but operators have been wary of the capability of public clouds in handling a mobile network.\n\n\"I want to see it working for at least one to two quarters and have a roadmap to move at least 30-40% of my customer base by 2025-2026,\" said Mallik Rao, Chief Technology & Information Officer at O2 Telefonica, also known as Telefonica Germany.\n\nThe company has 45 million customers in Germany.\n\nAWS and O2 Telefonica did not disclose financial details of the deal.\n\nThe core network, which consists of high-performance servers in data centers, is the heart of a mobile network that securely routes data and calls at high speeds. A public cloud will cut costs, increase scale and allow repairs to be done without service disruption.\n\nU.S.-based Dish\u00a0(DISH.MX), which built its mobile network from scratch, became in 2021 the only telecom company to use AWS cloud for core network.\n\n\"Dish was much easier because they had no existing systems that had to be modified to work with the cloud,\" AWS vice president Jan Hofmeyr said in an interview.\n\nNokia, which also worked with Dish, will provide the software and AWS will provide its infrastructure for Telefonica.\n\nTelefonica first worked with AWS and Ericsson, and then swapped to Nokia and AWS, Rao said. \"The days of trial are over. I don't want to keep on trying.\"\n\nThe global telecom cloud market is expected to reach $108.7 billion by 2030 from $19.7 billion in 2021, making it a growth driver for companies such as Amazon.\n\n\"We want to make it a business to run telco workloads,\" AWS' Hofmeyr said, adding that the company expects more deals with other operators in the next 12 months.\n\n\"I would say in most cases the discussion is about timing versus should we move into the cloud.\"\n\nSource: https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/amazon-breaks-into-europe-5g-networks-with-telefonica-cloud-deal-2024-05-08/",

In its prior quarter, Microsoft announced that its AI capabilities contributed 6 percentage points of growth to the company\u2019s Azure revenue, up from 3% in the previous period, and analysts are looking for more.\n\n>Shares of Microsoft are up more than 10% year to date, behind rivals such as Google parent Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) and Amazon (AMZN), which are up 15% and 22%, respectively. Over the last 12 months, Microsoft\u2019s shares have climbed 32%, though Amazon has jumped 67%, while Google is up 47%.\n\n>Microsoft\u2019s AI ambitions got a healthy boost on Tuesday when it announced that Coca-Cola (KO) signed a five-year, $1.1 billion agreement to use the software giant\u2019s Azure cloud services and AI technology.\n\n>Microsoft has unleashed a torrent of new AI features and services for its enterprise and productivity apps and consumer platforms ever since it first debuted its revamped version of Bing and its AI chatbot in February 2023.",

    "selftext": "I wanted to identify stocks that are in the Standard & Poor's 500 (S&P 500) index whose total return (with dividends reinvested) has beaten the S&P 500 index either since 1993 or since the stock's IPO (Initial Public Offering) if it was after 1993. I used the ETF (Exchange Traded Fund) SPY as my benchmark for the S&P 500 index because the web site I used to make comparisons [https://totalrealreturns.com/n/SPY](https://totalrealreturns.com/n/SPY) needed an S&P 500 index ETF for comparison, and since SPY - which started in 1993 - is the oldest S&P 500 index, I used SPY and that's why the cutoff is 1993.\n\nI used a stock screener to make a first pass filter, looking for the following criteria:\n\n* Included in the S&P 500 index. This limited the cohort to large. profitable US companies that meet the requirements to be included in the S&P 500 index [https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/equities/sp-500-index/](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/equities/sp-500-index/) S&P 500 stocks are available as fractional shares at my brokerage Charles Schwab and at other major brokerages.\n*  Pays a dividend and has a non-negative 3 year dividend Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR). Companies that pay a dividend - and particularly companies that initiated paying a dividend or have been increasing their dividend - have outperformed the S&P 500 index and experienced the highest returns relative to other stocks since 1973\u2014with significantly less volatility.  [https://www.hartfordfunds.com/insights/market-perspectives/equity/the-power-of-dividends.html](https://www.hartfordfunds.com/insights/market-perspectives/equity/the-power-of-dividends.html)\n* 5 year total return (with dividends reinvested) close to or better than the 5 year total return of the S&P 500 index. This was to help narrow down the cohort to stocks that have continued good performance in recent years, and to exclude stocks that perhaps were outperforming the S&P 500 many years ago but have been lagging the past 5 years. The 5 year total return of the S&P 500 the past 5 years is +94.69% so I used a minimum of +90% 5 year total return as a cutoff.\n\nI then compared the total return (with dividends reinvested) of the filtered stocks and eliminated any that had a total return less than that of the S&P 500 since 1993, or since the stock's IPO if it was after 1993. Each stock was compared head-to-head against the S&P 500 index (SPY) during equal time frames. For example, this is the comparison of SPY vs MSFT [https://totalrealreturns.com/n/SPY,MSFT](https://totalrealreturns.com/n/SPY,MSFT) which had its IPO in 1986, and the comparison of SPY vs NVDA [https://totalrealreturns.com/n/SPY,NVDA](https://totalrealreturns.com/n/SPY,NVDA) which had its IPO in 1999.\n\nI made a spreadsheet of the 134 stocks that meet the criteria. I did this at the end of last month so the results are current as of the end of March 2024. The spreadsheet has the following columns:\n\n* Symbol: self explanatory\n* Company: self explanatory\n* Total Return: the total return (with dividends reinvested) of the stock since 1993, or since the stock's  IPO if it was after 1993\n* S&P 500 TR: the total return of the S&P 500 index (with dividends reinvested) during the exact same time frame displayed for the total return of the stock being compared to the S&P 500 index\n* Ratio: the total return of the stock divided by the total return of the S&P 500 index during the same time frame. A Ratio of 2 means the stock had 2x the total return of the S&P 500 index during the same time period. A Ratio of 10 means the stock had 10x the total return of the S&P 500 index during the same time period, and so on. Even a Ratio of 2 is significant because it means the stock had double the total return of the S&P 500 index during the same time period.\n* 5 Yr Total Return: the total return of the stock the past 5 years. For comparison, the total return of the S&P 500 the past 5 years is +94.69%\n* 3 Yr Div Growth Rate: the 3 year dividend Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of the stock.  The Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) represents the year over year rate at which dividends would have grown annually if they had grown at a steady rate over the time period. Steady dividend growth - growth in dividend per share, *not* the dividend yield - is associated with company vitality and is a positive. If a stock has not been paying dividends for at least 3 years the value is blank, but that isn't a negative because it means the stock recently initiated paying a dividend, and that is associated with outperformance.

I colored the highest values in each column in varying shades of green. The darker the shade of green the higher the value range. I did not use rigid criteria for coloring different value ranges, but looked for natural separation points or certain arbitrary values, such as >3 or >200%, etc.\n\nLooking for stocks that are some shade of green in the Ratio AND 5 Yr Total Return AND 3 Yr Div Growth Rate columns can help identify strong performers. For example, familiar stocks like AVGO, AMAT, MSFT, and LLY are green in three columns, but so are lesser known stocks like KLAC, MPWR, PCAR and others.\n\nThe spreadsheet:\n\n[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Hh20ZoGg9mOamnSMZcdlOWjSIS9ppthhOI-mgQxe\\_pA/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Hh20ZoGg9mOamnSMZcdlOWjSIS9ppthhOI-mgQxe_pA/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nYes, past performance is not a *guarantee* of future results, but a stock that has a documented track record of beating the S&P 500 index over an extended period of time is more likely to continue doing so than a stock that has been unable to beat the S&P 500 index over an extended period of time.\n\nI hope this is helpful to people, especially young people looking to explore the universe of individual stocks that exists beyond ETFs.",

Stargate is anticipated to be operational by 2028, marking the final phase of OpenAI's AI upgrade. This U.S.-based supercomputer is part of a series of installations planned over the next six years. The projected cost of $100 billion has been attributed to conversations with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Microsoft's initial cost estimates. The project is progressing through five phases, with Stargate as the fifth phase, while Microsoft is concurrently working on a smaller, fourth-phase supercomputer for OpenAI.

    "title": "Tesla (TSLA) DCF Analysis",
    "selftext": "***NOTE: NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE***\n\n# Introduction:\n\nTSLA is the world's most renowned Electric Vehicle(EV) automaker, catalyzing the world's acceleration towards Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) Vehicles. TSLA has become the gold standard for what a high-quality EV stands for, all thanks in part to their founder's vision and belief in renewable energy especially during the tumultuous early years of TSLA. TSLA no longer just stands for EV but renewable energy, having branched out into Energy Storage, and Solar Panels.  TSLA hopes to create an ecosystem for renewable energy from charging to energy storage to the vehicle used, all this tied together by dedicated software created by TSLA at every point of contact in the ecosystem. This ecosystem business model has seen massive success as evident from businesses like GOOG, AAPL, and MSFT. I believe the next frontier of growth for TSLA comes from energy storage rather than automotive, however automotive will still account for the largest chunk of revenue for TSLA.\n\n# Market:\n\nTSLA's closest EV competitor is BYD. TSLA has won BYD on almost every front. A country where BYD has managed to wrest control from TSLA is Thailand. So I'll analyze this market specifically to rationalize why I believe this victory will be shortlived.\n\nIn Thailand, the top 3 most popular car models are BYD Atto 3, Netta V, and BYD Dolphin ([SOURCE](https://carnewschina.com/2024/01/09/byd-is-bestselling-ev-brand-in-thailand-in-2023-neta-is-runner-up/)).   \n\n|Model|Price|Range|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|BYD Atto 3|1.1M Baht|521 km/charge|\n|Neta V|0.55M Baht|380 km/charge|\n|BYD Dolphin|0.75M Baht|427 km/charge|\n|Tesla Model 3|1.59M Baht|513 km/charge|\n\nIn Thailand, 60.17% of the population owns a car ([SOURCE](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1027960/thailand-car-ownership-among-consumers/)) with the average car price being about 0.78M Baht. This means that a Tesla Model 3, TSLA's cheapest model is double the average price of a normal car in Thailand. \n\n[SOURCE](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1030220/thailand-average-monthly-income-per-household-by-region/)) which means that the Tesla Model 3 is a luxury good rather than an affordable commodity for the average household. The difference in price between BYD and Tesla is a full year's worth of income for the average household which leads the price-conscious consumers in Thailand to naturally gravitate towards BYD, hence the popularity of BYD over Tesla in Thailand. \r  \n\r  \nUltimately, I do believe that if TSLA continues competing on quality and finds ways to cut costs such as directly setting up factories in Thailand ([SOURCE](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/03/05/business/thailand-tesla-factory-talks-intl-hnk/index.html)), it will be able to close the price gap with BYD. As \"people are really stretching their wallets to be able to afford a Tesla. It\u2019s quite a difficult thing for them to do, and remarkable that it\u2019s the best-selling car in unit volume, despite being much more expensive than other high-volume cars.\u201d - 2023 Q4 Earnings Conference\r\n\n# Revenue:\n\nTSLA has 5 revenue channels, namely \u201cAutomotive Sales\u201d, \u201cServices and Others\u201d, \u201cAutomotive Lease\u201d, \u201cAutomotive Regulatory Credit\u201d and \u201cEnergy Generation and Storage sales\u201d. \n\n***Automotive Sales***\n\nAutomotive sales refers to the direct sale of TSLA\u2019s vehicles fully paid upfront.\n\nElon Musk believes that manufacturing capabilities will be the most important C.A. for TSLA. \u201cperhaps the most important competitive characteristic of Tesla in the future will be manufacturing technology\u201d -  2023 Q4 Earnings Conference. \r\n\nWhen forecasting the Number of Vehicles each Gigafactory can produce, I took into account that Elon Musk recently unveiled in the 2023 Q4 Earnings conference that there is a new revolutionary manufacturing technology that is expected to drastically improve production. He hopes to pilot test this technology at the Texas Gigafactory to produce their low-cost EV before proceeding to replicate the technology in every Gigafactory. \u201cthe sensible way to go about things is kind of figure out the core technology of the manufacturing line and then replicate it with improvements throughout the world.\u201d -  2023 Q4 Earnings Conference.\r So, in my first 3 years, I assume that the growth rate is below historical averages as TSLA tests out new technology in preparation for the launch of the low-cost EV. I assumed that TSLA\u2019s manufacturing technology was successful.\r  \n\r\r\r  \nWhen forecasting %Vehicles delivered, opting for less granularity I forecasted it as a % of historical averages\r  \n\r  \nWhen forecasting Avg Price/Vehicles Delivered, Elon Musk doesn\u2019t believe in price increases to increase the topline. As evident in 2021 and 2022 where Elon Musk only increased prices due to supply chain constraints before bringing prices back down in 2023. In China, Elon Musk ended up cutting prices due to being able to source significantly cheaper batteries there. I assumed that over time as TSLA enjoys sufficient economies of scale, they will only increase prices in line with perpetual inflation.\r  \n\n\n***Services and Others***\n\nTSLA provides a few services such as home servicing in certain regions or customers pay to access TSLA\u2019s network of SuperChargers.\r  \n\r  \nLifetime number of TSLA automobile (Ex roadster) delivered ([SOURCE](https://backlinko.com/tesla-stats))\n\nAssuming that TSLA is properly maintained they can last \\~20 years ([SOURCE](https://caredge.com/blog/how-long-tesla-batteries-last)). Opting for less granularity, in my forecast I assumed the total lifetime number of tesla cars remained constant without any churn.\r\n\nWhen forecasting Services and Others, Opting for less granularity I assumed that the servicing\u2019s pricing grew following the price of the vehicle in line with historic averages. \n\n\r  \n***Automotive Lease***\n\nTSLA has 2 types of lease, \u201cDirect Vehicle Operations Lease\u201d which leases out vehicles to customers for up to 48 months afterwards the vehicle is returned to TSLA. \u201cDirect Sales Lease\u201d either granting the customer title of the vehicle once full payment has been made or the customer has the option of refusing the vehicle.\r  \n\r  \nWhen forecasting Automotive leasing, as prices for TSLA fell in 2023, Automotive leasing as a percentage of Automotive Sales dropped as it is now cheaper for customers to purchase their tesla in 1 lump sum payment. I assumed that following this trend, as TSLA\u2019s affordability increases over time the %Automotive Sales decreases as well before remaining constant in perpetuity.\n\n\r  \n***Automotive Regulatory Credit***\n\nTSLA has excess carbon credit which it sells to competitors.\n\n\u201cIt will continue for some period of time, but eventually this stream of regulatory credits will reduce.\u201d ([SOURCE](https://www.businessinsider.com/tesla-9-billion-revenue-selling-regulatory-credits-to-other-carmakers-2024-2)).\r  \n\r\n\nWhen forecasting Automotive Regulatory Credit, given that TSLA does not intend to depend on these credits for revenue, I assume that as a %of Automotive sales, credit will contribute to a significantly lesser amount in perpetuity. This is further exacerbated by other automobile companies accelerating their push towards EVs as countries begin phasing out ICE vehicles. So, more companies begin having excess regulatory credits as well. Ultimately, I believe that leading up to 2030 the amount of revenue contributed by Regulatory credits decreases to a significant level. \n\n\r  \n***Energy Generation and Storage Sales***\n\nTSLA produces Energy Storage systems e.g. Megapack and Solar Energy related products e.g. Solar Panels which it directly sells to customers.\r  \n\r  \nFor energy storage more specifically megapacks, as the world phases out ICE vehicles and begins embracing renewable energy, it leads to a surge in demand for electricity. However, the issue with renewable energy is that \u201cThe most common renewable energy sources like the sun and wind are intermittent or have lower baseload capabilities than coal, natural gas, or nuclear sources. This makes it necessary to have a way to conserve excess energy produced during peak hours. This extra energy can then be supplied through the grid or otherwise when the sun is down, or wind speed reduces.\u201d ([SOURCE](https://www.batterycycle.io/why-is-tesla-focusing-on-the-battery-energy-storage-market/)). As an example to elaborate on how much importance is placed on energy storage, China mandates that all renewable energy facilities must store at least 20% of their total output ([SOURCE](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwiYquPrkuaEAxXuSGwGHffzBkgQFnoECA0QAw&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.forbes.com%2Fsites%2Ferikkobayashisolomon%2F2023%2F12%2F20%2Fenergy-vault-wins-big-with-gravity-storage-in-china%2F%23%3A~%3Atext%3DChina%2520has%2520mandated%2520that%2520all%2Cgeneration%2520capacity%27s%2520worth%2520of%2520storage.&usg=AOvVaw3WMq0w9-2ka0Cz2kAGbCWX&opi=89978449)).\r  \n\r  \nThe closest competitor to TSLA in energy pack is BYD. The TSLA\u2019s megapack is smaller in dimensions compared to BYD and on top of that TSLA has built its own software to be compatible with the megapack hardware with features such as Autobidder (Software to optimize energy trading) and Powerhub.\r  \n\r  \nRight now what's stopping revenue for energy storage is production capacity, TSLA opened its megapack factory in Lathrop to curb this. TSLA has also announced its plans to build a megapack factory in China to assist with production capacity ([SOURCE](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-12-22/tesla-acquires-land-for-shanghai-megapack-battery-factory)). As an overarching goal for my forecast, I took into account the TSLA master plan 3.\r  \n\r  \nWhen forecasting number of dedicated megapack factories opened, I assumed that TSLA would open 1 additional plant every 3 years for the next 10 years, to meet the large surge in demand as countries accelerate their push towards renewable energy.\r  \n\r  \nWhen forecasting Max Output/Factory, taking into account this article on expected output. ([SOURCE](https://www.nextbigfuture.com/2023/11/tesla-megapack-factory-production-limit-solved-and-capacity-will-be-doubled-to-80-gwh.html)). TSLA\u2019s Lathrop Megapack factory can produce 80GWh/Year in part due to them doubling their existing lines and resolving certain issues. Over time I believe that TSLA can massively increase the Max Output/Factory, as TSLA consistently touts their innovations as having an S curve of progression, where progress is slower at the earlier stages before exponentially increasing. \r  \nAs a sanity check, in my base case assuming that all Mega packs are still at 4 MWh. TSLA has to produce 406,200 Mega Packs or 81,240 Mega Pack per factory a year by 2038. As of November 2023, the Lathrop factory can produce 20,000 megapack. So, in 15 years I believe it is a reasonable amount of time necessary for TSLA to ramp up their production 4x.\r  \n\r  \nWhen forecasting %GWh Deployed, I had to assume total output which is a function of max output and the number of gigafatories. I assumed that over the years as more countries begin phasing out ICE vehicles in favor of EVs, there is a larger need to deploy more energy storage so this % increases to a large extent.\r  \n\r  \nWhen forecasting Avg Sales/GWh Deployed, Elon Musk does not like to increase sales through increasing pricing which was why when TSLA enjoyed economies of scale from increasing output in their Lathrop factory the Avg Sales/GWh Deployed decreased. So, applying this principle of TSLA slashing prices when costs decrease due to economies of scale, I assumed that TSLA continued slashing prices before increasing by the perpetual inflation rate.\n\n# Cost:\n\n\r\u201cpredicting auto gross margins is extremely challenging since there are many moving parts to this equation, some of which are out of our control like the change in tariffs or local incentives to name a few. While the teams are focused on cost reductions, we are approaching the limits within our current platforms.\u201d - 2023 Q4 Earnings Conference. \n\n  \nWhen forecasting Automotive and Non-Automtoive COGS, COGS as a %revenue for 2021 and 2022 are likely to be lower due to TSLA pre-emptively increasing sales price to deal with inflation. However, in 2023 COGS as a %revenue increased as TSLA cut back on sales price. Going forward, I\u2019ll assume that TSLA tends towards historic pre-covid average. However, in the long run, as TSLA successfully implements their manufacturing technology this % will decrease even further.  \nWhen forecasting R&D, SG&A, and Others, opting for less granularity I forecasted it as a % of historic averages.\n\n# WACC:\n\nUS 10Y T-Bond (1M Avg) = 4.12%\r  \nBeta ([SOURCE](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA/)) = 2.41\r  \nStable Market ERP ([SOURCE](https://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/datafile/ctryprem.html)) = 4.60%\r  \nCOE = 15.21%\r  \n \r  \nTSLA is rated at BAA3 ([SOURCE](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DBAA))\r  \nCOD (1M Avg) = 5.72%\r  \nMarginal Tax Rate = 21.00%\r  \nAT-COD = 4.52%\r  \n\r  \nMarket Price (5D Avg) = $178.50\r  \nShares O/S = 3184.79M\r  \nMarket Value of Equity = 568485.02M\r  \n\r  \nWeighted Average Maturity = 2 Years\r  \nFY23 Interest Expense = 156M\r  \nMarket Value of Debt = 4578.78M\r  \n%Debt = 0.80%\r  \n%Equity = 99.20%\r  \nWACC = 15.12%\r  \n\r  \nCurrently, TSLA has a very large beta as its stock has increased in volatility in the past few years. However, I believe that this volatility will not persist for very long as most big tech stocks enter a stable stage where their beta tends downwards. So, as a proxy for how low TSLA\u2019s beta will tend to, I looked at other big tech stocks.\n\n\r\n\n|Name|Beta|\n|:-|:-|\n|Google (GOOG)|1.04|\n|Microsoft (MSFT)|0.89|\n|Meta (META)|1.21|\n\nTaking the average beta, we arrive at a beta of 1.05. Assuming similar D/E composition and bond rating. I assumed that it took another 10 years for TSLA to reach the stable state.\r  \n\r  \nStable State COE = 8.95%\r  \nStable State AT-COD = 4.52%\r  \n\rTSLA\u2019s stable stage WACC = 8.90%\r  \n\n\n# Conclusion:\n\nUltimately in my base case, I value TSLA at $186.88 per share. I believe that there is still room for TSLA to grow, having such a strong first movers advantage in the renewable energy market means that TSLA is heads and shoulders above its competitors. I believe that the market is undervaluing the Energy Storage arm of TSLA's business, and less emphasis is placed on this potentially disruptive segment of business. \n\nBase Case: \\[[INSERT](https://imgur.com/a/nZjoZRs)\\]  \nWorst Case: \\[[INSERT](https://imgur.com/a/aMYlmm3)\\]  \nBest Case: \\[[INSERT](https://imgur.com/a/2VOKzoU)\\]  \nSanity Check: \\[[INSERT](https://imgur.com/a/rVQr2uF)\\]  \nRevenue Model (AUTOMOTIVE): \\[[INSERT](https://imgur.com/a/ucXnT5K)\\]  \nRevenue Model (ENERGY STORAGE): \\[[INSERT](https://imgur.com/a/xiRJYhN)\\]  \nCost Model: \\[[INSERT](https://imgur.com/a/KVByje0)\\]  \nChange in NWC: \\[[INSERT](https://imgur.com/a/3rDs1Be)\\]",

    "selftext": "This isn't a post about AI bubble or why the chip and cloud hardware supplier is on a nutty uptrend. Their revenue in cases like NVDA has grew 120%+ YoY with insane profit margin, and since market is short sighted, it makes sense why the insane run. Lot of people kicking themselves for not see this coming, or someone like me who saw it coming but exited earlier because couldn\u2019t value the \u201cshovel\u201d correctly in this gold rush.   \nNow lets take a step back and look at this trend from a different angle. Main buyers are the big 5 Google, OpenAI, META, AAPL, AMZN, MSFT (GOMAM).  \nIn order for your you all to understand my next points we all first have to agree on few basic things  \n**1). Companies have FINITE capex amount**  \n**2). Every company at the end of the day WANTS to make money**  \n**3). Every company wants to find a way to REDUCE their capex and still grow**  \nFor point #2, the way these company will eventually make money is by selling the products to consumer and business. So in next 5-10 years we will see leap in software and services innovations. We will see so many new small and midsize companies using these applications to build more complex solutions on cloud. Now take your guess who will benefit the most from this? if your answer is GOMAM, thats correct. If your answer is NVDA then you are an idiot.   \nI would say point #1 and point #3 go hand in hand, we are seeing lot of capex diverted within the company itself. So to no surprise, GOMAM are already building and some have built their own silicon. Its just matter of time when they start to reduce their exposure to external company. This isn\u2019t to say that NVDA will ever become irrelevant. The point is they will always have to outgrow and justify for GOMAM to spend their capex on them. This is the bet you are making for going LONG nvidia at these valuation. Because again, market is short sighted, they are seeing 6-12 month guidance and pumping.  \nNow i am seeing crazy amount of doom and gloom for companies like AAPL and GOOG lately on reddit and also on media. I just have one question, that goes to #2. How do you guys think every software and services that will leverage these new silicon will reach the end users? Think for a second form a consumer standpoint. They don\u2019t know wtf is NVDA, AMD. All they know is smartphones, tablets, wearable, laptops. I am not saying where you should invest your money. I am just saying don\u2019t go with the trend like a madman. if you miss the shovel rush, you can still make plenty of money on factories that will make gold products for end users.   \n**in summary,**   \n**I see there is more value in going long on GOMAAM (Added AAPL) than NVDA,AMD**",

    "selftext": "Alright folks, mega caps and AI are all the rave but there's plenty of rather unknown companies which are growing their earning's at a tremendous rate. My portfolio in 2022 was Costco, Nvidia, Apple, Google and MSFT. They all did beautifully but they're too big for my liking now. Here's the speculative crap I'm investing in now\n\n**1. GigaCloud Technology** \\- Is like an Amazon or Alibaba but removes the consumer and does B2B ecommerce, no debt, strong cash flow, P/E ratio still reasonable for massive YoY growth. Already up a lot on this company and earning's coming up Q4 which expecting big beat.\n\n**2.** **Vita-Coco** \\- Everyone's all about Celsius or Monster, Coconut Water imo is the next best thing with a growing market, COCO, is the market leader. Summer's here, coming off winter lows and just had big beat in Q4 which normally worst quarter when its cold. Summer they partner with alcoholic brands and all the weight loss craze leads me to believe ppl are choosing healthy drink alternatives.\n\n**3. Braze** \\- Companies need a way to stay in touch with their customers, Braze creates a subscription model which handles all types of communication with customers and automates the process. This company is working its way towards becoming profitable. I was watching YT channel who interviews entrepreneurs, saw freelancer making $150k+ a year using the software to help companies so to me that's huge to see in the real world without even having looked for the company.\n\n**4. Draft Kings** \\- California and Texas still have not legalized online gambling which those two states alone are absolutely massive. Texas won't vote on it again until 2025, casino's in Oklahoma donate to Texan politicians to help influence keeping gambling out of the state but 2025 imo we see big changes. There's a huge catalyst here and earning's are growing with combat sports massively growing.\n\n**5.** **Sofi -** The numbers don't lie. When rate cuts were plausibly announced we saw a massive jump. This company wants to run when rate cuts come but until then ppl really weary even though the numbers and guidance are phenomenal.\n\n**6. Palantir** \\- S&P500 inclusion didn't come after 5 quarters now of GAAP profitability, so in June imo we'll see it happen which is a huge catalyst. The earning's are growing as a we all know. I don't like the P/E ratio but this is a company I'd buy and immediately sell CC's on and keep selling CC\"s until reaching my assigned price and repeating while holding long term.\n\nEveryone of these companies imo has strong growing earning's, relatively unknown still compared to what everyone's piling into, and most have major catalysts coming up. COCO has summer, DK has legalization of massive states, Sofi has pending rate cuts, Palantir has sp500 inclusion, at least Braze and Giga about to report and beat as they do Q4 which should act as minor catalysts imo.",

    "selftext": "\\#AMD\u2019s MI300 chips will be its growth engine for the future and the key reason for buying this stock. While I don\u2019t believe it will get close to Nvidia\u2019s near monopolistic market share of 80% there is ample room for more competitors and AMD will benefit from the AI boom as well.  \nIt recently upped its guidance for 2024 for artificial intelligence-related revenue to $3.5B up from $2B previously.\n\n$AMD Chief Executive Dr. Lisa Su said she had \"good confidence\" the company will be able to exceed the $3.5B figure this year and the $1.5B run-rate for the coming fourth-quarter. $1.5Bn run rate implies $6Bn in annual sales.  \nHowever, based on Citi analyst estimates, AMD is likely to generate $5B this year and $8B next year from the MI300 - they believe that Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta (META) are the largest customers for the MI300, which was unveiled in December to much fanfare. And with the average selling price at roughly $10,000 for Microsoft and $15,000 or more for other customers, it's possible AMD is purposefully underestimating sales figures, possibly on supply concerns?  \nFor Q4-2023 AMD results were in line with expectations  \nEPS: $0.77 per share, adjusted, versus $0.77 per share expected  \nRevenue: $6.17 billion, versus $6.12 billion expected  \nData Center revenue $2.28Bn in line V $2.29 expected.  \nGuidance was light:  \nQ1-24 $5.4Bn in sales, plus or minus $300 million, V $5.73 Bn expected.  \nFlat data center revenue with server chip declines to be offset by AI GPU sales. We saw weak data center revenue from Intel, this is definitely some cannibalization and likely to continue, till AI GPU starts taking a larger share of the pie.  \nClient Group - The recovery in PC\u2019s helped AMD\u2019s client group, which rose 62% year-over-year to $1.46 billion in sales, which the company said was boosted by recent chip launches.  \nGaming, which includes \u201csemi-custom\u201d processors for Microsoft Xbox and Sony Playstation consoles, fell 17%. AMD blamed slower console sales, and said it expected semi-custom revenue to decline by a \u201csignificant\u201d double-digit percentage in the current quarter. This is a low margin business and drags AMD\u2019s overall margins.  \nAMD\u2019s embedded segment, which includes chips for networking, reported $1.1 billion in sales, down 24% on an annual basis.",

    "selftext": "# Introduction:\n\nThe gaming industry has been gaining notoriety in the news lately, with the MSFT-ATVI acquisition and the hype around NVDA boosting the stock prices for the gaming industry as well. EA, in particular, investors have been overly bullish on them. I believe that the current EA model of acquiring studios to acquire their IPs is ill-fitted for the gaming industry considering the success stories of other game developers e.g. Riot, Valve, etc all relied on having a champion cash cow. EA's problems go beyond just their business model, their largest cash cow the FIFA series has recently ended its partnership with the FIFA organization and spun off into EA Sports FC, the success of EA Sports FC is uncertain now that the main body overseeing football no longer backs the FIFA series.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# REVENUE:\n\nThere has been a paradigm shift in how EA will approach its business model, EA wants to make players more interconnected. \u201chaving more friends and building stronger friendships in our network leads to more time spent playing and connecting. As a cornerstone of our priorities of growth, we will continue to implement these tools across our portfolio\u201d - 2023 Q4 Earnings conference. So, going forward their focus will be on making their large titles feel more interconnected rather than buying new and smaller titles. \n\nEA has split revenue into 3 tranches,   \n\u201cFull Game Download\u201d, \u201cPackaged Goods\u201d, and \u201cLive Services and Others\u201d\r  \n\u201cFull Game Download\u201d refers to virtual downloads of the game released by EA.\r  \n\u201cPackaged Goods\u201d refers to hard copies of the game that EA sells to a third party.\r  \n\u201cLive Services and Others\u201d refers to DLC.\n\n***FULL GAME DOWNLOAD***\n\nWhen forecasting Games Released, I'm uncertain to what extent EA will execute their new paradigm shift so to avoid making incorrect assumptions I assumed that the number of titles EA released would be in line with historic averages.\n\nWhen forecasting Revenue/Game, given that management\u2019s guidance was to focus on older and bigger IPs to create a community. I assume that sales of new games grew at historical averages before tapering down to grow in line with inflation.\n\n***PACKAGED GOODS AND LIVE SERVICES***\n\nWhen forecasting Live Services and Others, I opted to use a nominal Y/Y to reflect the uncertainty in this arm of revenue. As Live Services and Others are only driven by a few popular and older titles e.g. Apex Legends, FIFA, etc. I assume that Live Services grows in line with historic averages as EA figures out how best to grow their community before there is a slight ramp-up in growth and then tapering down to grow in line with inflation until perpetuity.\n\n# COST:\n\n***R&D AND COST OF GOODS SOLD***\n\nWhen forecasting R&D and COGS, opting for less granularity I followed historic trends and took the historical averages.\r\n\n***MARKETING***\n\n\rWhen forecasting Marketing, \u201cOperating expenses were up 5%, excluding our fourth quarter restructuring charge. Our people costs increased as we continue to invest behind our portfolio, and we also saw higher marketing spend to support new releases.\u201d - 2023 Q4 Earnings conference. I assume that Marketing will increase to an elevated level to support more marketing for older flagship IPs and remain elevated till perpetuity.\r\n\n***G&A***\n\nWhen forecasting G&A, given that EA has stated their desire to build out communities rather than developing more and more different kinds of games, I assume that G&A remains constant till perpetuity.\r\n\n***OTHERS***\n\nWhen forecasting Others,  I opted to follow historic trends and assumed that it would continue till perpetuity.\n\n# WACC:\n\n***COST OF EQUITY***\r  \nUS bond rating of AA+\r  \n10Y T-Bond Yield (5D Avg) = 4.27%\r  \nAA+ Risk Spread (5D Avg) = 0.55%\r  \nRFR = 3.72%\r  \nBeta ([SOURCE](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/EA/)) = 0.82\r  \n4050 = (4050 \\* 4.25%) \\* (1+16%) / (1+R) + \\[((4050 \\* 4.25%) \\* (1+16%)) \\* (1+3.82%) / (R - 3.82%)\\] / (1 + R) \\^ 2 \r  \nR = 10.3%, ERP = 6.58%\r  \nCost of Equity = 9.12%\r  \n  \r  \n***COST OF DEBT***\r  \nEA has a bond rating of A-\r  \nA Bond yield (5D Avg) = 5.37%\r  \nMarginal Tax Rate = 21.00%\r  \nAT Cost of Debt = 4.78%\r  \n\r  \n***WEIGHTAGE***\r  \nStock Price (5D Avg) = $136.89\r  \nShares O/S = 272M\r  \nMarket Value of Equity = 37234M\r\r  \nWeighted average maturity = 15 Years\r  \nBased on 2023 10-K, effective i/r = 4.97% assumed constant. \r  \n2023 Interest Expense = 93.4M\r  \nMarket Value of Debt = 1917M\r  \n%Debt = 4.90%\r  \n%Equity = 95.10%\r  \nWACC = 8.91%\n\n# CONCLUSION:\n\nUltimately, in my base case, I value EA at $110.76 per share. I believe that EA is overpriced and their IPs are not as valuable as Investors make them out to be, especially after considering the fact that there is high uncertainty revolving around their most successful IP, FIFA. The uncertainty of how successful their main IPs like Apex Legends, Starwars, and Battlefield can be after the shift in business model leads me to believe that the stock is overvalued. \n\nBase Case: \\[[INSERT](https://imgur.com/a/HtxeYrI)\\]  \nBest Case: \\[[INSERT](https://imgur.com/a/tHoXeN0)\\]  \nWorst Case: \\[[INSERT](https://imgur.com/a/pFQlrLb)\\]  \nRevenue Model: \\[[INSERT](https://imgur.com/a/y4OobUs)\\]  \nCost Model: \\[[INSERT](https://imgur.com/a/8kWN8uA)\\]  \nChange in NWC Schedule: \\[[INSERT](https://imgur.com/a/qpi0OwJ)\\]  \nSanity Check: \\[[INSERT](https://imgur.com/a/ryS5MWX)\\]  \n\n\n\r  \n\r  \n",

This means that the supply of code should increase over time which means more tech companies and competition.

This was an impulse buy driven by my personal interest (AI), so I hope this wasn't too irrational of a purchase.

OpenAI's loss of staff (up to 70%!) and leadership will cause it to go into permanent stagnation and lose its lead (unless they pull off some miracle this week).\n\n MSFT is perfectly positioned to take over OpenAI's near monopoly on consumer AI in less than a year. They already know how to operate OpenAI's hardware infrastructure and have poached many of OpenAI's employees and leadership.\n\nAI is the \"next big thing\", as big as the PC, the Internet, or the iPhone, and AGI, in whenever year it comes, will be even bigger.  AI hasn't fully saturated all domains, yet, so the full impact hasn't been felt by most people or industries... yet.\n\nPeople are commenting, \"but it's at ATH\", which is true.  AAPL was at an all time high in late 2006 (if I have the timing right), and then the iPhone happened.\n\nAnd all that said, this is 1% of my portfolio.  Calm down.  This was for fun.

They have also outperformed all other stocks in terms of growth, profit margins and forward EPS growth, and have stronger balance sheets. \n\nMost analysts expect that the M7 will continue to outperform all other companies until 2025 at least. \n\nNow I know this is a \"stocks\" subreddit but just like the majority of retail investors, a large chunk of my portfolio is alocated to an S&P 500 ETF.\n\nSo I am actually considering instead of DCAing into a broad index ETF, why don't I just DCA into those 7? Maybe even swap META & TSLA since I am not rly a big fan of, with other 2-3 large caps that I favor, like AMD, and ADBE.\n\nShould we expect these 7 to continue outperforming the rest of the world?

    "title": "Take-Two Interactive (TTWO) has tremendous risks. And why GTA 6 is an even bigger deal than you think",
    "selftext": "TTWO jumped on news of GTA 6 release, and it may seem obvious, but let's figure out why this matters to analysts so much.\n\nFounded in 1993, Take-Two consists of three wholly owned labels, Rockstar Games, 2K, and Zynga. The firm is one of the world's largest independent video game publishers on consoles, PCs, smartphones, and tablets. Take-Two's franchise portfolio is headlined by \"Grand Theft Auto\" (345 million units sold) and contains other well-known titles such as \"NBA 2K,\" \"Civilization,\" \"Borderlands,\" \"Bioshock,\" and \"Xcom.\" Zynga mobile titles include \"Farmville,\" \"Empires & Puzzles,\" and \"CSR Racing.\"\n\nThey have had a checkered EPS history, with low and wildly varying EPS from year to year.\n\nYear         EPS\n\n2023 (TTM)\t-$7.29\n\n2022\t-$2.25\n\n2021\t$4.56\n\n2020\t$4.31\n\n2019\t$2.98\n\n2018\t$3.24\n\n2017\t$1.73\n\n2016\t$0.17\n\n2015\t-$3.68\n\n2014\t-$0.90\n\n2013\t$4.01 (GTA V Release)\n\n**Sony Acquisition**\n\nLet's make one thing clear - an acquisition by Sony is clearly their only way to return capital to their shareholders.  They have been courted by Sony in the past, and more recently under dubious circumstances it was \"leaked\" that they were going to be acquired by Sony for an estimated $20 billion. This has proven to be false, per Sony. However, Sony is the ONLY possible acquirer of a company like TTWO, and so let's figure out how a sale to Sony could occur.\n\nThe most recent sale of Activision to Microsoft gives us the most recent multiple for a potential sale to Sony. Activision sold with a sale price of $68.7 billion, with a TTM revenue of $7.528 billion. This gives us a revenue multiple of \\~9.12x.\n\nBungie was acquired by Sony in 2022 for $3.6 billion, with revenue of only $200 million, implying a multiple of 18x. This comes with a heavy asterisk of analysts saying that they vastly overpaid, which is true by our other examples below.\n\nZynga was also bought by TTWO for $9.5 billion on $2.8 billion of revenue, giving us a multiple of 3.4x.\n\nEpic Games' June 2020 financing valued it at $17 billion based on an estimated $5 billion in revenue, which is also a 3.4x revenue multiple.\n\nElectronic Arts trades at approx a 4.5x revenue.\n\nPlaydemic was acquired by EA for $1.4 billion, with revenue of $211 million in revenue, giving us a multiple of 6.6x.\n\nIf we were to assume that TTWO sells to Sony based on their TTM revenue of $5.35 billion with a floor multiple of 3.40x and a high multiple of 9.12x, this gives us potential sales prices of between $18.2 billion and $48.8 billion, quite a range but plenty of more room on the upside. Compare this with their current $22.8 billion market cap.\n\nHowever, there are a few things wrong with this assumption, namely GTA 6 and Sony itself.\n\nFirstly, the multiples we established were based on TTWO's TTM revenue, which doesn't take into account a massive title release like GTA6 that would not be captured in their revenue. In fairness, neither does any of the other mulitples we used. However, I would ask you about Epic Games, Zynga, EA, Bungie, and even Activision... did they have any titles coming out (before their sale) that are as hotly anticipated as GTA6? The answer is no, and so I think it is fair to not give as much weight to the floor as we should to our ceiling price.\n\nSecondly, and most importantly, a potential sale can only occur if Sony has the resources to fund it. And my fat conclusion is **no. They cannot buy it.** Firstly, while the MSFT acquisition of Activision has opened up the acquisition from the regulatory side, Sony simply does not have the funds or the ability to acquire it. They only have a cash balance $14 billion.\n\nAnd if you don't believe me, their CFO stated their company has only around $5 billion left to spend for acquisitions, which means they are most likely in the hunt focusing on smaller studios. They don't have the warchest of MSFT.\n\nWhat this means for TTWO is that they have no possible exit unless Sony's cash pile swells to a significant degree, because there are simply no other possible acquirers. And importantly, TTWO **simply does not generate significant free cash flow to their shareholders.**\n\nTTWO has to rely on cash flow generated from operations because they will not have a reasonable exit in the next 5-10 years. This means GTA6 and their other upcoming titles have to do a lot of work to bide them time for a Sony acquisition. No one thinks GTA6 is going to flop, but this industry has been mired in flops the last few years from major studios.\n\nDon't take it from me, take it from their 10-K:\n\n\"Grand Theft Auto and certain of our other titles, such as Red Dead Redemption or NBA 2K, are \"hit\" products and have historically accounted for a substantial portion of our revenue. Grand Theft Auto products contributed 14.6% of our net revenue for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2023, and the five best-selling franchises (including Grand Theft Auto), which may change year over year, in the aggregate accounted for 52.9% of our net revenue for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2023. If we fail to continue to develop and sell new commercially successful \"hit\" titles or sequels to such \"hit\" titles or experience any delays in product releases or disruptions following the commercial release of our \"hit\" titles or their sequels, our revenue and profits may decrease substantially, and we may incur losses.\"\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nGTA 6 is even a bigger deal than you think. If this flops, they don't make money. TTWO right now is a bet on GTA 6, full stop because they have no alternative but to continue independently, with no prospect of any suitors. They have to continue to deliver on big titles every single year.\n\nTheir historical EPS doesn't suggest a market cap of anywhere near $24 billion, even taking into account post GTA 5 years. There is tremendous risk at these prices in this company, it assumes they will never produce a flop.\n\n&#x200B;",

Bad companies not bringing any profits are exploding because they are being memes.\n\nAnd I dont know what to do because it looks like the stock market will be flat for the next couple of years and interest rates for real estate are so humongous I don't qualify. I thought the stock market is the way to park money but this + inflation = I'm losing money left and right.\n\nEdit: major stocks that I still hold since 2019. Enph, sedg, dis, msft, AMD, wm, mmm, aapl, atvi.\n\nEdit2: thanks for all the hate!",

I'm looking for advise as to what those funds should be\n\nCurrently, each ROTH account contains - FEPIX, LLDYX, MXFIX, COST, MSFT, QQQ, SLV, IVE, IJH, ICF, IJR and VEU\n\nSome more background might help as well -\n\nThe wife and I have 3 more years of work..

It's basically an LLM with a bunch of tools to design a portfolio for you according to your investment goal.

I got a little lucky with massive jump in ETH, at which point it suggested to rotate some of the profits into SGOV/BND, and reduce crypto exposure in general, so I'm down to about 6% crypto total.\n\nICLN was a little surprising as a recommendation, considering the political climate, but it paid off so far, up about 7%. \n\nProbably lucky timing as well, since the market was up in general. Actually the only losing investment was BTC-USD, down about 5%.\n\nThe whole portfolio looks pretty conventional, which is probably not too surprising considering that LLM would likely give you middle-of-the-road advice.",

Right now about 60% of the portfolio equity is effectively tied to big tech/AI (mag7). I\u2019d like to cut that concentration, move to a fund-only setup, and keep costs low. Also somewhat of a hedge towards AI bubble burst.\n\nTarget mix (household level)\n\n* 75% U.S. large cap\n   * 50% core (S&P 500 or total market: VOO/VTI or equivalents)\n   * 25% \u201ctop-7 light\u201d allocation to reduce reliance on AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, AMZN, NVDA, META, TSLA (leaning XMAG; open to RSP if that\u2019s cleaner)\n* 25% diversifiers\n   * 10% value (VTV or IWD)\n   * 5% mid cap (VO or IJH)\n   * 4% small cap (VB or IJR)\n   * 6% international (VXUS or IXUS)\n\nHow I\u2019d implement\n\n* IRA: start with XMAG only (no S&P/total market in IRA) to cut the mega-cap tilt fast with no tax hit. \n* Taxable: keep the S&P/total-market core (VOO/VTI) and systematically exit all single-stock positions, prioritizing the big tech names first. Do it tax-sensitively with about $10\u201315k per year in realized gains, have dividends go to cash to fund the new ETFs, and aim to finish in roughly three years.\n\nMy rationale for this vs just holding S&P 500?\n\n* Keeps broad U.S. exposure but dials down single-name risk.\n* XMAG (or equal-weight) helps with the current top-heavy market.\n* The diversifier slice is pretty boilerplate imo. \n\nQuestions:\n\n1. Does this combo (core + XMAG + value/mid/small/international) seem like a sensible way to cut big-tech exposure? Not a full divestment (though I'd like to - it's too risky of a bet), but a reduction in overexposure.\n2. For placement, would you park value/mid/small in the IRA and leave international in taxable for the foreign tax credit, or is that not worth optimizing?\n3. Is \\~$10\u201315k per year in realized gains and a \\~3-year glidepath a reasonable way to unwind single stocks in taxable?\n4. End stage I'd like to remove the \"managed\" signifier from these two accounts entirely. Has anyone had luck asking for a reduced brokerage fee or flat/retainer model for the advisors? How would you recommend I broach this full strategy with them?\n5. Should I deploy something similar with my 403b (if the available funds allow)?\n6. Anything else I'm missing?",

I think people get it very wrong when they say \"you can't time the market\".\n\n  \nWhat you can not do is take out a bunch of calls at all time highs and expect to win. Or buy puts when the market crashes 20% in a week (April 2025) and expect to win.\n\nThat kind of market prediction is ***GAMBLING*** and will blow up your account.\n\nHow a professional times the market is by building positions that work in different ***SCENARIOS*** and then closing those positions when they \"work out\", which Warren Buffett called, workouts.\n\nRight now I have positions that:\n\n1.

So you'd get a high cost basis.\n\nTiming the market requires a little patience, good breadth of strategy, and some common sense. And that's it.",

    "selftext": "Sorry for the click-bait(ish) title, but this is something that I have been thinking for a while, and I wanted to share with the community.\n\nMy story: I am old. Really, LOL on me, I know.\n\nI grew up poor AF in generational poverty, in a hell hole of a place too. And, ever since I was a kid, I was exposed to both well educated people and rich people as well. And while I was in awe with the educated people, I hated being poor, and I wanted to be financially stable one day.\n\nFast forward to today, I put myself through college, first one of my expended family and friends to do so, and the overachiever me got 1 BS and 1 MBA, where I also took classes in finance/investing (one of my papers was in binomial derivatives).  All along I also studied on my own personal finances and investing. I still remember my very first investment, I lost $200 in a sure bet stock!  LOL\n\nThe core:\n\nI ran my personal finances like running a company: revenue, OpEx, and CapEx.  No matter how poor I was I always lived within my means and I did not fall for the easy consumer credit. Fuck that.\n\nI live in NYC and I still live very frugally, and manage to have fun to on a small budget. And I save what I feel it's a lot of money (remember, I grew up poor AF).\n\nI run my portfolio like a hedge fund, or a Family Office if you will.\n\nAnd I take the easy/lazy road, that, unbeknown to Social Media and Reddit, often use a simple trick to \"beat\" the market: they invest in the SP500 and *tweak* the returns with some easy minor positions, either shorting the dogs (puts), and boosting the winners (stocks / calls) and pimping their positions by writing calls.\n\nI took my inspiration from them:\n\n1. The vast majority of my portfolio is in QQQ / SPY\n2. I have a minority of my portfolio that I have allocated to AI *at large*, MSFT is the largest holding there\n3. I have a minority portion of my portfolio that I have allocated to Quantum stocks.\n4. I have a minority portion of my portfolio that I have allocated to \"Disruptive Technologies\"\n5. I have a minority portion of my portfolio that I have allocated to wild cards.\n6. Note:\n * 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 above represent <10% of my portfolio cost basis,\n * and I don't rebalance\n * I make monthly buys across all positions religiously on the first day of the month. I accumulate positions, I rarely take a position with a single transaction.\n * I never take money out of my portfolio\n7. And yes, wife and I max out on 401K plans at work, invested in SPY. It's all part of the \"portfolio\"\n\nI track my NetWorth using Empower, and I track my future cash flow with a simple spreadsheet. My finances are easy: 1 checking account, 4 credit cards (2% cash back citi for personal 2% cash back fidelity for business, 5% cash back CHASe for amazon, 6% cash back AMEX for groceries) that I pay off at the end of the month, all payments are auto-pay to my credit cards or to my checking account.\n\n\nSo, that's my hedge fund. And IMO it's the correct way to look at it.\n\n\nMy advise to you is:\n\n1. Live within your means, paying interest on consumer credit to buy things you don't ned with money you don't have, to impress people you don't like is silly. And if you're broke, there's no investment what will take your negative net worth and make you \"rich\". That's how people fall for scams.\n2. Get an education on investing, if it's not your thing just do the BogleHeads way https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Three-fund_portfolio , but if you get a good investment education, your own Hedge Fund can do miracles with your hard earned savings.\n\nThank you for coming to my TED talk.",

Currently sitting with about 40% in stocks and in looking at their statements now,   he made most of his purchases in 2016 to 2018 time frame and hasn't done much since. while that can sometimes be a good thing, I do question the assortment of stocks that he has.\n\nI admit that I tend to be a little trigger happy and nervous sell when things are looking bad, but am i crazy for thinking that he should have unloaded some of these stocks years ago? Their current list of stocks include: AMGEN, BP, CAT, CLF, CSCO, DIS, F, IBM, INTC, IP, JPM, KO, MCD, MSFT, QCOM, UPS, VZ, WMT L, and XOM. Certainly a few winners in there but plenty of Duds\n\nSounds great that it is up 95% since Inception about 8 years ago, but in that time VTI/SPY has tripled and NASDAQ has quadrupled\n\nAnothet big red flag to me is that the cash they currently have is just sitting and getting 1.55% instead of being in a high yield savings account, FZDXX, or something\n\nIs time to look elsewhere for a new FA?\nThoughts or feedback? \n\nTIA\n",

    "selftext": "I'm a longtime trader who recently caught a sizeable windfall in the markets which has motivated me to do something I've been meaning to do for a long time: Consolidate my various accounts, move to a DMA broker, upgrade my toolsets and services, and hone my skills so I can trade more in this crazy new climate we find ourselves in. I scalp futures contracts almost exclusively, and swing trade the big stocks/funds. I also have long term investments that I don't touch except to rebalance.\n\nI also happen to be a professional software developer, over 20 years with .Net/Rust and various smaller frameworks. I'm getting into algo trading slowly. I have accounts with TradeStation, IBKR, and NinjaTrader since their SDK is C#. I'm probably going to ditch IBKR b/c TradeStation so far has been amazing. NinjaTrader isn't DMA, but being able to write complex algorithms in a programming language I know is a huge plus.\n\nI have some questions about tools as I inherently trust nothing on the internet, I figure everybody is in everybody else's pocket. \n- Is Benzinga Pro everything it's cracked up to be? Or is there a better source of news, e.g. Bloomberg, CNBC, etc. It's expensive, but anything that can give me an edge on the market I consider extremely valuable.\n- Is using a trading journal service worth it? I have my eye on TraderSync, but TradeStation comes with some decent reporting tools that export to excel. TraderSync is also expensive so I'm wondering what edge it would give a scalper.\n- Are signaling services worth it? I've seen Eagle Investors and Trade Ideas mentioned a few times on various /r's. How do they signal? Webhooks would be great so I could integrate it into MSFT Teams. And yes I know better than to use them as a single source of truth, confirm with other tools.\n\nMy current toolset consists of heavy technical analysis, TradingView (ultimate edition or whatever it's called), and Tradestation tools (TS Workstation, Maestro, but I'm not great at backtesting tbh) in addition to Benzinga and other reputable news sources, but they aren't fast enough which is why I'm asking about the signaling services. I do fairly well, > 50% profitable trades and always end up in the green at the end of the month, if even by just a hair :-) I can say with great certainty that moving to DMA has already increased profits, so I'm very willing to invest both time and money learning new tech if it gives me an edge. Their desktop client is amazing, but I'm still learning it. Being able to set trailing stops is extremely nice.\n\n(My ultimate goal btw is to integrate all of this into code I'll write, but that's down the line, I'm in the requirements gathering phase of the SDLC)\n\nThanks!\n",

Forgive me if I spell something incorrectly, English is not my first language.\n\nhttps://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4590406\n\nSo I read this paper about 100% Stock portfolios after watching a YouTube video on it (multiple out there).\n\nAnd I wondered how I\u2019d go about choosing the stocks I\u2019d invest in. I did so because just last year I didn\u2019t touch stocks but when I went on my app on my iPhone (Stocks) and saw how much I could have made had I just invested in stocks that were already a big presence in almost all of my ETFs the. I\u2019d have more value to my name.\n\nTo look at it I viewed an era that had large fluctuations in which I invested in which lead me to 2019 to 2024 because in-between that we had the fed-induced boom and the crash that came before that along with other crazy fluctuations.\n\nSo for my example I used march 2019 to March 2024 (which had steep decreases and increases):\n\n1.MSFT: 250.92% \n2.Apple: 248%\n3.Meta: 176.44%\n4.Googl: 149%\n5.Amazon: 96.46%\n\n1.QQQ: 140.45%\n2.VTI: 84.34%\n3.VOO: 81.39%\n4.VT: 54.38%\n\nHere is the Summary of percentages those sticks hold for each ETF:\n\n1. QQQ: ~41.3%\n2. VOO: ~22.2%\n3. VTI: ~13.0%\n4. VT: ~6.1%\n\n\nIt\u2019s not like investing in Meta, Apple, Google, and Amazon is unheard of, they already make a huge part of all ETFs you come across that measure commonly used domestic indexes. So\u2026 is this the way? I truly want your critique on this because if it works it works and if not then it doesn\u2019t, it\u2019s not about proving I\u2019m right it\u2019s about maximizing my understanding of investing. \n\n\n\nEdit: I think people misunderstood and I didn\u2019t articulate it well either. IM NOT PREACHING FOR 100% stocks but I want your opinions on it! I want to see if maybe it IS the way. I want to grow my knowledge on the topic.\n\nFor transparency I\u2019m (23 M) currently at 51k\n60% ETFs / 40% Stocks.",

    "title": "Microsoft: Growth, Investments, and Future Valuation in AI and Cloud Dominance",
    "selftext": "* Microsoft\u2019s stock has been stable, trading around $402.85, with a market cap of $2.96T.\n* Cloud and AI are major growth drivers, with Azure revenue up 31% YoY and AI services growing 157%-175%.\n* Heavy CapEx investment of \\~$80B affects short-term cash flow but aims for long-term AI/cloud leadership.\n* Valuation suggests a potential price target of \\~$500 by FY2026 if growth expectations hold.\n* Risks include declining free cash flow, valuation compression, and AI adoption uncertainty.\n* Microsoft\u2019s quantum computing efforts focus on topological and neutral atom qubits, aiming for scalable quantum hardware.\n* Security is a key pillar, with over $20B in revenue and AI-driven threat detection processing 65T signals daily.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) is maintaining its market leadership worth nearly $2.96 trillion. The market cap of its stocks is currently $2.96 trillion, currently trading at $402.85, reflecting its stable and firm trend over this year, ranging between $385.58 and $468.35 during a 52-week trading. While there have been minute movements in its stocks, its trend in total is generally sideways. Financially, Microsoft performed well in FY 2024, with its revenues improving 15.7% yearly, amounting to $245.1 billion, and earnings improving 21.8% to stand at $88.1 billion. The company\u2019s consistent numbers support its growth prospects in its business divisions. Despite the challenges of escalating capital investment and increasing competition in AI, Microsoft's strategic investment in AI and cloud continues to drive growth. They are well positioned for stability in the long term and success in the future in a transforming technology landscape due to their investment in AI solutions, business solutions, and growth in the cloud.\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s collaboration with AI models will offer the company tremendous growth in the near future. Since the explosion of AI, the Microsoft Azure program has become invaluable to other enterprises looking to integrate AI into their platforms. The high quality of Azure\u2019s programs is a massive growth driver for MSFT. It has experienced a YoY revenue growth of 31%, which is over 3 percent above the predicted 5-year CAGR of AI models. Microsoft Cloud itself also experienced a notable 21% YoY increase in revenue and 12% growth in revenue in Q2. In January of this year, MSFT gained permission to add the Open AI model to their neural network, Copilot. These companies\u2019 collaboration takes advantage of the $13B revenue run rate (predicting future revenue based on a company\u2019s current revenue) of AI models and their YoY growth of 157%\u2013175%. MSFT\u2019s AI programs will gain huge amounts of revenue from the 345 million users using its services.\n\nMicrosoft is making a massive investment in its future, expecting to spend around $80 billion on capital expenditures this year - nearly double what it spent just a couple of years ago ($44\u2013$55 billion). Most of this money is going toward building AI-powered data centers and expanding its cloud infrastructure, ensuring the company stays ahead in the rapidly evolving tech space. In the short term, this aggressive spending is putting pressure on free cash flow (FCF), which was about $70 billion over the past year and even saw a 29% drop year-over-year in Q2 FY25. But Microsoft is playing the long game\u2014by fiscal 2026, FCF is expected to recover to $82.38 billion as these investments start paying off. This is a familiar playbook for Microsoft, much like when it bet big on cloud computing years ago. The short-term financial squeeze is real, but the payoff could be enormous, setting Microsoft up for 15+ years of sustained growth and solidifying its position as a leader in AI and cloud computing.\n\nIn terms of current valuation metrics, Microsoft's current stock price as of February 1st, 2025, is 121.95, and the forward P/E ratio is 33.4x. Additionally, its expected earnings per share (EPS) for Fiscal Year 2026 is $15.04, as well as a 12-month target price of $490, based on earnings growth and valuation expectations. In terms of projected price target calculations, the standard valuation formula is used, and via the given EPS for 2026 and P/E ratio, it is projected that the stock price by the end of fiscal 2026 will be approximately $500. This, however, is under the pretext that Microsoft maintains a P/E ratio of 33.4x. Stock valuation fluctuates based on market conditions; thus, if the market decides that Microsoft deserves a lower valuation, for instance, a P/E ratio of 30 instead of 33.4, the target price would change, falling to around $451. This suggests that if Microsoft\u2019s stock trades at a more conservative multiplier, the price might be closer to $451 instead of $500. Microsoft's Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) is at 13.3%, meaning that Microsoft's stock would be growing at a healthily above-average rate compared to the broader market. Microsoft's cloud computing (Azure) and AI services are key growth drivers as AI-related revenue is projected to exceed $10 billion annually, growing at 175% year-over-year. The growth of overall revenue, at approximately 12-13% per year, supports earnings growth. The growth margins are expected to be 68-70% in FY 2025 and FY 2026, indicating profitability, and the Free Cash Flow (FCF) is expected to exceed $65 billion in FY 2025 and $72 billion in FY 2026, meaning that Microsoft has money to reinvest or return to shareholders. However, risks include the fact that their valuation relies heavily on AI expansion; therefore, if AI adoption slows, the stock might not meet growth targets. Additionally, a declining P/E ratio could bring the price closer to $431 instead of $500. Competition also plays a key role, as rivals such as Google Cloud and AWS (Amazon Web Services) are also growing their AI and cloud businesses, which could impact Microsoft's market share and interest rates. Finally, economic conditions influence investor sentiment, ultimately affecting stock valuation. Overall, Microsoft remains a strong investment, but future performance depends on AI adoption, earnings growth, and maintaining investor confidence.\n\nMicrosoft integrates security into its cloud and AI strategy with a Zero Trust approach, AI-driven threat intelligence, and a unified security platform. Its key security solutions include Microsoft Defender, an AI-powered XDR for endpoints, cloud, and email; Microsoft Sentinel, a cloud-native SIEM and SOAR for real-time threat detection; and Microsoft Entra, an IAM solution with multi-factor authentication, conditional access, and identity governance. Microsoft\u2019s cybersecurity business is rapidly growing, generating over $20 billion annually at a double-digit rate, serving 785,000+ customers, and investing $1 billion+ annually in security research and development. AI-driven security processes 65 trillion signals daily, enabling real-time threat mitigation. This robust security framework strengthens Azure adoption, AI deployments, and enterprise trust, making security a growth driver rather than an add-on. By embedding security across its cloud ecosystem, Microsoft reinforces its leadership in cybersecurity while accelerating Azure and AI innovation.\n\nTL;DR: Microsoft maintains market leadership with a stable stock price, driven by AI and cloud growth. Heavy CapEx investment impacts short-term cash flow but positions the company for long-term gains. Valuation suggests a price target of \\~$500 by FY2026, but risks include free cash flow declines and AI adoption uncertainty. Quantum computing advancements and a strong cybersecurity ecosystem further solidify Microsoft\u2019s market strength.",

    "selftext": "About a year ago, I took over my traditional IRA which had been professionally managed for a good while. It has a wide range of individual stocks like AAPL, AMD, AMZN, AVGO, AXP, BRKB, COST, CRM ... V, WBA, WMT (28 stocks and funds) for example, with share quantities ranging from 1 to 20+ for the individual stocks. Most, have really nice returns, but the quantity of each tends to be so small I question whether it would be wise to sell most and invest in a mix of SCHD, FXAIX, SCHG, FTEC, and FBGRX. I've already cleaned up a bunch of small quantity positions, but there are still a ton of them. I reinvested the proceeds into the funds above.\n\nWould it make sense to sell most of these remaining small positions and concentrate those funds in selected ETFs and MFs as mentioned above? I've pretty much settled other Roth and IRA accounts into a mix of S&P 500, dividend ETFs, and growth funds. But this one account remains to be cleaned up and is worth around $135k-ish currently. \n\nI'm not generally a fan of bond funds, but do have about 6% in FXNAX. I've consolidated other stocks I sold into FXAIX and SCHD, about 27% and 29% respectively. And I put some in several growth funds too like FBGRX and FTEC, about 16% between them. So the remaining 20+ stocks comprise maybe 20-25% of the account. While I kinda like having BRKB, MSFT, NFLX, NVDA, META, etc., the share quantities are so low that I wonder if I would be better off selling them and reinvesting them in my core ETFs and MFs above. \n\nFor the record, our current income is from Social Security, RMDs, and my wife who will likely work for 6 to 8 more years. I've been retired for years. The majority of our funds are in different Roth and 403b Roth and 403b IRA accounts. The account in question above is a rollover from a job years ago.",

    "selftext": "As the title says, I started a position in SBUX last year and with the recent run up I am wondering if locking those gains (30%) selling and buying more VOO or something else like that is the play. Same with MSFT. I've got a nice 40% gain on that too, but also think that company is amazing so maybe should hold for 20 years.\n\nI'm pretty passive. I love investing, but don't truly know or understand how to read company financials. I can see myself allowing maybe 5-10% of my portfolio trying to learn, have fun and pick, but think the bulk should be in broad ETFs.\n\nI also see my current ETF portfolio is offering better returns than my attempts at individual picks. It's really just fun to try and pick a winner and see if that happens. \n\nI've had plenty of losers and just wait them out to get in the green and have put that money into ETFs. I know maximizing growth is the ultimate focus, but I guess this is a long winded way to ask, when do you take profit?\n\nEdit: These trades would be in a Roth.",

DCA (Dollar-Cost Averaging) for the win!\n* **Stock selection matters:**\u00a0The \"Magnificent 7\" are heavily exposed to the tech sector, which had a strong year, but that also means higher volatility.\n* **Patience is key:**\u00a0I didn\u2019t touch the investments throughout the year, and that was crucial for these results.\n\nThis was a personal experiment that helped me learn more about the impact of regular investing and how the market can reward those who stick to a disciplined strategy.\n\nIt\u2019s just my experience\u2014not right, not wrong\u2014just mine, and I wanted to share it with you!\n\n**Discussion**:  \nHas anyone else here tried investment \"experiments\" like this?

This approach is considered risky, but I have strong conviction in their relative valuation, defensibility, and long-term prospects.\n\nIn this case I believe that 'diversification' among AI stocks would do more to dilute my returns than mitigate my risks. Particularly because they're all highly correlated and despite its market cap, Nvidia has the most reasonable valuation all things considered. We'll see if the bet pays off.\n\nTo clarify, I am confident in the long-term prospects of Palantir, Tesla, and others, but I'm just not comfortable with the valuations. I may reassess in the future when I have new information or valuations change.\n\nMeta is the only other stock I held onto, given my bullish view on their AI and hardware strategy combined with their attractive valuation.\n\n# Unrealized (current investments)\n\n* **Meta (META):**\u00a0\\+367.97%\n* **Nvidia (NVDA):**\u00a0\\+117.05%\n\nNvidia's performance here is understated since I recently increased my holdings, but it's up \\~200% since I initially purchased it last year after\u00a0dithering for months.\n\nThese returns are less impactful without the values or relative weights, but I\u2019d like to maintain some anonymity around it.\n\n# Rate of return (IRR)\n\nMy annual return (IRR) for this portfolio (Jun 2022 to Dec 2024) is\u00a0**73.6%**.\n\n# Investment thesis\n\nSee a summary of my investment thesis in a\u00a0[previous update](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/17mzc07/15_year_followup_on_buying_the_dip_on_pandemic/).\u00a0**TL;DR:**\n\n>\u201c\u2026AI is another secular trend like PCs (Windows, Mac), the internet (browsers, search, social) and mobile (iOS, Android, wearables). The difference is that new technology like AI can now spread faster than ever before and get used in new ways. Every new epoch uniquely benefits from the past, potentially bending the growth curve in new ways.\n\n>The other difference is that Nvidia has a monopoly position on the core technology driving this innovation. Therefore, the \\~350% run up over the last 12 months doesn\u2019t make NVIDIA the stock of the last year, but rather it\u2019s the stock of the next decade. The recent 3X gain will be a blip compared to what\u2019s coming thanks to NVIDIA\u2019s CUDA (moat), among\u00a0[other things](https://stratechery.com/2023/nvidia-on-the-mountaintop/).\u201d\n\n>\\- [1.5 year follow-up on buying the dip on pandemic stocks](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/17mzc07/15_year_followup_on_buying_the_dip_on_pandemic/), Nov. 2023\n\n# Nvidia's dominance\n\nI'm still working through my thoughts here, but my strong conviction around Nvidia comes in part from these observations:\n\n* Nvidia is\u00a0[founder-led](https://www.amazon.com/Nvidia-Way-Jensen-Huang-Making/dp/1324086718/)\u00a0and focuses on accelerated computing while remaining broad enough to allow for innovation and insight across industries where it can apply its core competencies.\n* It's unprecedented to have such dominance in such a fast-growing, valuable industry while maintaining such a long-term sustainable advantage.\n* This advantage is due to unreasonable investments (research, hardware, software, ecosystem, relationships) over decades, making it hard to copy.\n* AI will consistently make software\u00a0easier to create, thus reducing the moats of software companies and make them less attractive than hardware companies (for now).\n* Despite their impressive growth, Nvidia is still supply constrained, which is fundamentally easier to predict than demand constraints.\n\n# We still underestimate the AI opportunity\n\nMost importantly, we\u2019ve barely scratched the surface of AI\u2019s opportunities and benefits. Even the most ambitious targets underestimate it because the better and cheaper AI gets, the more use cases we'll find.\n\nWe have a habit of confusing the limits of our imagination with the limits of reality. Our imaginations are trained on what happened before, but there has never been anything like this before.\n\n# Final thoughts\n\nI'm still well within the '*maybe I'm just lucky*' phase since it's only been a couple years. Towards the end of [my last update](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1d758m7/2_year_followup_on_buying_the_dip_on_pandemic/)\u00a0I also shared a few ways my investment approach has changed, which I\u2019m still benefiting from.\n\nI expect my next update to be the 3-year update in mid 2025.\n\n**UPDATE:** Thanks for mentioning I should have included indexes for benchmark context. Indexes like QQQ and S&P 500 also had good returns during the same period (June 2022 - Dec 2024). For an apples to apples comparison, the IRR of QQQ and S&P 500 respectively during this period were \\~24% and \\~16%.",

There must be a number of criteria that can be evaluated based on publicly available data and are hypothesized to correlate with positive financial outcomes in the age of AI automation.

    "selftext": "**1. Valuation Metrics Are Sky-High**  \nPalantir currently trades at a Price-to-Sales (P/S) ratio of approximately 53.13, significantly higher than industry peers.\n\n[GuruFocus](https://www.gurufocus.com/term/ps-ratio/PLTR) Even for a growth company, this level of valuation is extreme and implies future growth rates that may be unattainable.\n\n\n\n**2. Revenue Growth Isn\u2019t Scaling as Expected**  \nWhile Palantir\u2019s revenue growth has been solid, it\u2019s showing signs of deceleration:\n\n* FY 2022: 24% year-over-year growth\n* FY 2023 (projected): 18% year-over-year growth\n\nThis deceleration doesn\u2019t justify its premium valuation. Additionally, the company remains heavily reliant on government contracts, which are often lumpy and unpredictable.\n\n**3. Profitability Is Still Questionable**  \nDespite boasting about achieving GAAP profitability recently, Palantir has heavily relied on stock-based compensation (SBC). In fact, SBC accounted for approximately 30% of their operating expenses last quarter, which dilutes shareholder value and raises questions about true profitability.\n\n**4. AI Hype Is Inflating the Bubble**  \nThe market has been overly optimistic about Palantir\u2019s AI capabilities. While their AI Platform (AIP) sounds promising, actual adoption metrics and revenue contribution from AIP remain vague. It\u2019s easy to talk AI; it\u2019s harder to monetize it sustainably.\n\n**5. Insider Selling Signals Lack of Confidence**  \nExecutives have been offloading shares at a significant rate. For instance, Chairman Peter Thiel sold a substantial portion of his holdings recently.\n\n[Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/insiders-lead-sell-palantir-stock-223000919.html)If the leadership team doesn\u2019t see long-term upside at these prices, why should we?\n\n\n\n**6. Competitive Pressure Is Mounting**  \nPalantir operates in a crowded space with competitors like Snowflake ($SNOW), Databricks, and Microsoft ($MSFT) offering similar or better solutions. Palantir\u2019s dependence on government clients limits its commercial reach in comparison.\n\n**TL;DR:**  \nPalantir is an interesting company with solid tech, but the stock price is disconnected from fundamentals. High valuations, slowing growth, heavy SBC, and reliance on government contracts make $PLTR a risky bet at current levels. AI hype has driven the price into bubble territory, and insiders don\u2019t seem confident in its future.\n\nWhat do you think? Is $PLTR worth its valuation, or are we seeing another overhyped tech bubble?

Which can be explained by how the payout works, because the payout isn't a pot of money but a share that then has to be sold by the counterparty (a short seller against a long buyer).\n\nWhat does this have to do with investing? I think a lot of people get this backward. They buy a stock ahead of earnings anticipating good earnings (or sell it anticipating bad) and then the stock does the opposite of what they expect for a time, sometimes even a little after the earnings volatility is crushed.\n\nSome people just hold through this \"volatility\" and never seem to figure out why it happens in the first place. But others get absolutely discouraged at timing their buying of shares of their stock and end-up buying in a suboptimal way; such as DCA'ing on the way up.\n\nI bought PM right before earnings because it moved down and I knew that for everyone to lose price had to move up; that is where the \"bet\" breaks even. And sure enough it did.\n\nI like PM as a company, I expected its earnings to be good so I expected that tailwind anyway. But I timed my buy to a price of $114.62 with options.\n\nSo I had a massive advantage going into the earnings purchase to stack my PM shares.\n\nLastly; I wanted to point out that I bought PM very confidently because of pre-earnings behavior that PM would go up even though I think to an untrained eye PM looks \"weak\" coming off an all time high and they would therefore assume it'd continue to be weak. That going any higher would seem \"too much\".\n\nBut the market's cup runneth over regardless how absurd it may seem because of the recent run.",

    "selftext": "hey all, sharing what i'm calling my \"frontier tech\" portfolio, broken down by percentages. i'm looking for valuable input, feedback, and discussion around it. and, if it happens to be helpful to anyone, even better. i do want to clarify a few things:\n\n* i'm focused on AI, bitcoin, and space. investment vehicles or not, i simply think each are tech frontiers that hold tons of promise, are poised for massive growth, and will bring immense amounts of value to the world over the next few decades. let's just call this a \"frontier tech\" portfolio, to give it a name i can reference.\n* i'm not looking for feedback that just disagrees with that thesis. whether you think AI is all hype, or you are anti-Bitcoin and think it's a ponzi scheme, or you think space is a waste of resources, or anything along these lines - that's ok, i respect that perspective, but i'd like to avoid arguing about it. we just disagree about some fundamental things, and you won't convince me i'm simply wrong.\n* i AM looking for feedback on blind spots, poor/missing assumptions, overconfidence, things i'm not considering, or any other constructive input that falls within the framework of the overall thesis. i'm not just looking for people to agree with me (though that is interesting input as well) - i just want feedback that can be applied within my overall investing philosophy.\n* yes, i'm missing some key areas of what many would call \"frontier tech\" - biotech, green / nuclear energy, cybersecurity, to name a few - but i just don't have the same level of confidence in specific areas of those. i prefer to stay relatively focused on the categories where i'm most confident and able to stay up to date.\n* i'm trying to keep my language somewhat appealing to a wide audience. not looking to get too bogged down in technical details or language that would alienate someone reading this stuff who's less familiar with one or any of the spaces/categories.\n* my primary goal is a portfolio of funds and stocks that i can invest in with *strong long-term confidence in growth.* not stuff i trade frequently. and not stuff i love the idea of or that seems interesting / sexy but that i don't know enough about (SMCI, PLTR, altcoins as some good examples). i also generally prefer companies whose leadership i trust and/or admire.\n\nok, with that out of the way, let's dive in:\n\n**30% AI** - 10% NVDA, 5% SOXQ, 15% balanced mixed of NOW, MSFT, AAPL, GOOGL, META, AMZN\n\n* HIGH LEVEL: to me, this category is ABSOLUTELY going to change our world in fundamental ways over the next several decades. AI's potential is not chatGPT, or smarter versions of it. it's far beyond what we're seeing from LLMs today. if you listen to the engineers and operational leaders within the AI space, listen to not what they \"believe\" is gonna happen, but to what they know is coming because they've already used the tech, usually 1-2 years before the public even sees it, these people are overwhelmed, amazed, terrified, enchanted, bewildered. to me, that's just very interesting. i believe what some others do - that we're in the midst or on the verge of another technological revolution. i'm not bothered much that AI isn't monetizing in demonstrable, repeatable ways. i think there's been and continues to be enough fundamental, increasing advancement in this field that the value creation will absolutely surpass what most people think. as for the individual stocks, i'll do a quick dive here. to be clear, I don't think these are groundbreaking choices and many are very obvious. but, seems useful to give my favorite things about each:\n* 10% NVDA - these guys are and will continue to be at the center of the whole thing. their moat is extensive. it's not just GPU / blackwell demand. it's their CUDA programming language and universe, and stickiness of it. it's the long-term horizon required for their data centers that makes 5-10 year customers out of everyone who buys their stuff. it's CEO jensen pushing them and already looking for the \"next big thing.\" just a lot of confidence here.\n* 5% SOXQ - i like this semiconductor ETF a little more than SMH because it's more diverse (SMH is like 25% NVDA, which is great if i didn't already allocate so much there), and it's got a low expense ratio (0.19%). i love this exposure because the AI industry is driven by these companies (e.g. TSMC, Micron, Broadcam, Qualcomm, AMD, AMAT).\n* 15% mix of these...\n   * NOW - excellent leadership and integrated heavily with NVDA tech; will benefit hugely from AI boom with AI-driven automation\n   * META - founder-run and with a clear vision; demonstrating enormous resources and focus on building AI models, meeting consumer needs, being pioneers in tech at large\n   * AAPL - will probably benefit the most from consumer-facing AI products and implementation; strong leadership\n   * AMZN - AWS is a profit monster that will be huge for AI tools and services and data centers; logistics and ecom will be big AI beneficiaries; strong leadership\n   * MSFT - deeply embedded in the AI revolution with its investment in OpenAI + AI integration into Azure and Microsoft 365; excellent leadership\n   * GOOGL - AI pioneer with DeepMind / Brain; they still own search; have enormous amount of data; questionable leadership but I'm holding for now\n* No TSLA??? no. i just don't trust elon musk enough at this point. and i need confidence in a company's leadership for me to invest in its stock. there's a big chance i'm missing out (their robotics division might be incredible), but I'm able to sleep OK with that.\n* i'm also missing plenty of other AI picks. i know that. these are the ones i can invest in with the most confidence.\n\n**30% Bitcoin** - 25% Bitcoin itself (cold storage or an ETF), 5% MSTR\n\n* HIGH LEVEL: why Bitcoin? books have been written about it, but to shortly summarize my perspective - it's quite volatile and risky short-term, and quite growth-oriented and (thus far) safe long-term. excellent store of value. wonderful technology, math/code based, and may or may not upend some portion of the financial system. limited supply that's only decreasing over time. immutable. now adopted by many big institutions. goes on giant bull runs every 4 or so years. some days, it's hard to justify NOT putting more into this one, but for now i'm convinced that\u00a0 diversification is the better long-term play.\n* 20% Bitcoin - many would argue that holding actual Bitcoin, ideally off exchanges and on cold storage is the smartest play here. but there are also arguments for FBTC or IBIT (helpful in tax-advantaged accounts; trusting an ETF seems safer to some - very debatable). i do some cold storage, and some FBTC (they self-custody their Bitcoin, which not everyone does). either way, just Bitcoin. it's the only crypto play where my confidence level is very high.\n* 5% MSTR - this is a leveraged Bitcoin play. strong chance it outpaces BTC growth rate during bull runs. i may shift some MSTR profits to Bitcoin over time if it starts to really offset my 4:1 BTC:MSTR ratio.\n\n**30% Space** - 10% ASTS, 10% RKLB, 5% LUNR\n\n* HIGH LEVEL: the tech for space finally seems to match the potential that's been talked about for decades and decades. for a while, space-x really proved this out, almost single-handedly. but we clearly have some strong other players either in or entering the category. my favorites are these three. here's why:\n* 10% ASTS - you should read the kook report (google it) for a true deep dive, but to hit my high level points: they are pre-revenue but with the potential for MASSIVE growth. effectively, their satellite system aims to offer a global cellular network. think starlink but more b2b and generally better tech. they own tons of patents. they are 5+ years ahead of what many think will be a winner-takes-most race. their partners already include AT&T, Verizon, Vodafone, Rakuten, American Tower, Bell Canada, and more. they have excellent leadership. i find this a risky-ish play as they have tons to still accomplish, but the potential growth is enormous.\n* 10% RKLB - effectively, a space-x competitor on smaller rockets, with a fraction of the market cap and a huge runway for growth. i think still heavily undervalued today. nerdy/awesome leadership. vertically integrated. as telecom, defense, and general research spending expands to space economy, RKLB is positioned very, very well.\n* 5% LUNR - i've spent less time researching them than the other two, but my confidence level in the risk/reward is still pretty high. key player in the lunar economy - one of few companies that can deliver payloads to the moon. very niche but valuable moat. huge potential, good amount of risks ahead.\n\n**10% cash** - ...to buy them juicy dips.\n\nok, that's my \"frontier tech\" portfolio summary. to repeat - this is what i can confidently invest in for what i believe will be better-than-average returns over the next 10+ years. i recognize that this discussion didn't even really touch share price, EPS, P/E, profitability, revenue, or other key details. this just isn't the place where i'm getting into that. i can say that i'm comfortable with the financial metrics and details regarding these companies. but this discussion is mainly focused on what categories i think are poised for the most growth, and what companies/stocks/assets in those categories seem to be most positioned to lead that growth. thanks for reading.\n\n*\\*\\*\\*The information provided is for educational and informational purposes only and should not be considered financial advice.

The network effect significantly applies to digital platforms, dating all the way back to the internet itself. When the internet became more widely used, more people relied on it to conduct work, deepen personal connections, and for research and other functions.\n\nExample: social network platforms\n\nThe network effect is especially prominent on online platforms that encourage users to add other users to the platform\u2019s network. Social networks such as Facebook and Instagram are key examples of the network effect. The more people that use the platform in an individual\u2019s network, the more likely it is that individual will use the platform, too.\n\nExample: E-commerce platforms \n\nE-commerce platforms, such as Amazon, also benefit from the network effect. As more retailers opt to sell their goods on Amazon, the more consumers will look to Amazon to shop. The reverse is also true.\n\nI currently invest in MSFT,GOOGL,META,V,MA.

Should I revert back to my original investment strategy within my 401(k) of the Vanguard 2070 TDF, or remain with my S&P 500 Index?\n4. Should I reduce my 12 month emergency fund into a 6 month emergency fund and lump-sum the difference in order to rebalance?\n5. Should I just go 100% VOO in my taxable account? 50%/50% VOO/VTI? Do I need to diversify with International within this account?\n6. Should I cut back on my savings/investments and focus more on myself/education?\n\nI will be doing some rebalancing on Jan 1st and around Tax Day, so any input is appreciated on how I should move things around.

    "selftext": "I am trying to level up my game, and for a pretty long time I just looked at the balance sheet, a few ratios, P/E, forward P/E, compared these to the industry average, healthy cash flow, debt etc. Most of the time I just did this on well known stocks, MSFT, AAPL, NVDA, INTC, AMD, META etc. basically companies you hear about a lot everywhere, I just had no trust in lesser known companies to outperform the market, even if these basic metrics were promising.\n\nNow it worked out relatively well since I started investing, but I feel like I didn't really beat the market by too much with my stock picks given the extra risk I took. There was a study by\u00a0[Cornell](https://www.cornell-capital.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/2024-Q2-Memo.pdf?_bhlid=91b22f94067500de4f838bfb72c6cdab059cf3dc), where one of the graphs show the % of SP500 stocks beating the SP500, and while the data doesn't go back too much -would love to see one that goes back until 1970-1980 at least-. however for the 2014-2023 period it can be seen that about 40-50% of the companies beat the 'market'. So basically if you stock pick with a random generator you have a good chance to have a similar performance to the market. So I believe with a proper educated research it would be possible to tip the scales in our favor.\n\nSo I feel like the way I picked stocks was sort of look at the most hyped and known companies, have a basic glance on some ratios and the balance sheet, and I feel like this is so bad that it will bite back after a while. I see quite a few people here on reddit and some other communities knowing so much about a company, the moat they have, why it's a good investment, why it would be a bad one etc. What is the proper approach to get information? What sources are valuable? I assume earning reports are one, but I doubt they have all the information of the industry the company is in, why it's better than competitors etc. surely there are some other sources that are used for all this.\n\nAny advice is appreciated!",

In 2022, hyperscalers saw their Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) dip as they ramped up AI spending. However, the latest data shows that their ROICs have already largely recovered outside of MSFT, even as they continue to grow their capital expenditures. If ROIC across the board continued to drop as capex has increased over the past 3 years these arguments about AI needing to move the needle may have some merit but that has not been the case.\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/Npft53D](https://imgur.com/a/Npft53D)\n\nThis quick turnaround highlights how effective AI is in driving value, not just hype. Take Facebook as an example. By integrating AI into their ad services, Facebook dramatically improved ad targeting and personalization, directly boosting ad performance and revenue. The optimization of AI-driven ad placements allowed them to deliver better results for advertisers, which translated into higher prices per ad and improved ad load efficiency. This AI-driven approach is a clear demonstration of how AI investments can rapidly translate into tangible financial benefits, reinforcing the high ROIC we are seeing across the board. \n\n",

I don\u2019t expect them to be stellar winners in the short term but wouldn\u2019t be surprised if they did rocket in 3-5 year\u2019s time. I think mRNA therapies are likely to be transformative, given their plug and play capacity along with AI modelling allowing much shorter and cheaper RnD cycles. \n\nWhat do you think about this and what other companies in the biotech sphere would you think are worth considering as a mid to long term investment?",

    "selftext": "[5 years ago I wrote a list of 20 stocks](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/coz3u7/strike_it_big_stocks_for_the_next_decade_a/)\u00a0I believed were high-risk/high-reward investments into new technology for the future. I think there are some interesting lessons to learn from this. Here's where they stand now:\n\n|| || |#Ticker|2019-08-12|2024-08-12|%| |GH|$98,63|$29,00|29%| |FLXN|$11,37|$8,50|75%| |VRTX|$179,84|$468,70|261%| |OMER|$18,41|$4,12|22%| |PCRX|$40,39|$12,74|32%| |HXL|$79,89|$62,16|78%| |FMC|$85,57|$61,15|71%| |MELI|$623,55|$1.883,16|302%| |MSFT|$159,03|$406,20|255%| |AMZN|$1.784,92|$3.341,80|187%| |SHOP|$366,73|$692,90|189%| |CRM|$140,72|$252,53|179%| |SQ|$62,63|$62,14|99%| |AYX|$131,08|$48,52|37%| |PYPL|$102,72|$64,72|63%| |TTD|$255,08|$993,00|389%| |ZM|$92,16|$56,10|61%| |MDB|$143,51|$235,40|164%| |OKTA|$130,50|$89,00|68%| |ZS|$83,21|$174,00|209%| |TWLO|$131,49|$60,37|46%|\n\nAverage return: 34%  \nAverage return on \"new tech\": -19%  \nAverage return on \"efficient tech\": 60%\n\nIf you invested in SPY in the same period: 80% Edit: it's 100%\n\nSo, you could dismiss this exercise by saying \"just invest in S&P 500\". But there's this one peculiar thing: the pricing of FMC and HXL doesn't make sense.\n\nHXL grew their revenue by 23% and their EBITDA by 74%. In contrast, FMC shrank their revenue by 13% and shrank their EBITDA by a whopping 60%!  And in this period their respective stock prices performed more or less the same. One could argue that it's because investors have more trust in the future of FMC's agrucultural products than in the future of HXL's advanced materials. But I don't think this is the case, both are somewhat boring technical products that investors don't have that much insight into.\n\nNo, I think the real difference is that FMC is in the S&P 500 and HXL is not and their stock performance is propped up by investors blindly shipping capital into S&P 500 ETFs. The P/S ratio of the S&P 500 has grown by 30% since 2019 meaning you are paying 30% more for the earnings the companies generate.\n\nIt will be interesting to keep track on this effect. I think it's still on the upswing as more and more young people are entering passive investing. But I wonder what the long term effects will be. I'll look at these stocks again in 5 years.\n\nEdit: wow, reddit really chewed up my table, I'll try to fix it later in the day...",

    "title": "Analyzing the Analysts: Using average analyst price target to identify possible buying opportunities amongst the top 100 companies in the S&P",
    "selftext": "Hello everyone,\n\nI'm a lazy investor and don't like to do much due diligence, but I do like to make money. Unfortunately these two things about me are often at odds as I've lost money in the past for not doing my DD. As such, I continue to be lazy but I try and find ways to work around doing due diligence and hopefully finding loop holes.\n\nOne such way that I have been thinking about recently is using analyst ratings, reviews and price targets as a surrogate for due diligence. In essence, I try to just have these analysts do the work for me. An idea I had is that much in the same way that with those who believe in technical analysis hold that everything you need to know about a stock is baked into it's price action, and so when something good happens the stock price goes up and when something bad happens the stock price goes down, thus all you need is to analyze trends in stock price and you'll be analyzing everything about the stock by proxy, I have a thesis (or theory) that perhaps you can do the same or something similar with analyst price targets of companies.\n\nNow I know that anyone who has read this far, already thinks I'm an idiot. Many experienced individual investors probably find market analysts to be stupid and therefor I'm stupid for following their lead, but I would argue to the contrary for a few reasons. As much as I have put in a lot of effort to learn about how the market operates (been investing for the last 6 years, started learning actively about it as much as I could a couple years prior to that), there is still much I don't know as I don't have a finance or economics degree. Moreover, as bad as you may think an analyst is, they are at least competent enough to keep their job as an analyst at the investment firm that allows them to make stock price target selections. Lastly, and most importantly, what I am about to discuss below uses the aggregate of several analyst price targets so I'm not relying on a single analyst but several (probably between 10 and 40 per company). I think if two-dozen analysts are strongly in favor of a company, it is unlikely that my novice investor wisdom would have researched the company and found a flaw that they all missed.\n\nSo what I did yesterday evening was go through the top 100 S&P 500 companies by market cap and find the current average price target for them on Yahoo Finance. I then divided the current stock price (at the close on 7/31) by that price target and expressed it as a percentage to see how far off the company was from the average price target analysts were aiming for. Then I also listed how many total ratings each company had, and how many of them were 'Strong Buys' and 'Buys'.\n\nThis yielded the following table:\n\n|+|A|B|C|D|E|F|G|H|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|1|Company|Current Price|Price Target|Percent to Target|Total Ratings|# Strong Buy Ratings|# Buy Ratings|% of Ratings that were Strong

This lead me to the following 11 companies:\nMicron Technologies (MU), Boston Scientific (BSX), Abbot Laboratories (ABT), Merck Scientific (MRK), Stryker (SYK), The Cigna Group (CI), Broadcom (AVGO), Comcast (CMCSA), Honeywell International (HON), Analogue Devices (ADI), and Intuit Inc. (INTU)\n\nI have about $5,000 I'd like to invest right now and I have half a mind to just put it equally weighted into these 11 companies and just watch it for the next year or two. I'll either do that or put it all in VOO, but I have a feeling that these 11 companies might beat the S&P 500 over the next 24 months.\n\nWhat do you guys think?",

I understand that future value is what drives current price, but I'm having a hard time understanding why new data that indicates poor recent results is an indicator of a better future.   \n\n  \nThanks",

    "selftext": "One of the arguments for investing in the S&P 500 is that it's cheaper (in the UK, net of tax) than global index funds, like the FTSE All-World. And you get most of the same risk-return profile, because the US stock market is the largest market.\n\nWhat if that logic was extended further?\n\nImagine a fund that only ever held one stock. The stock that had the largest market cap weighting in the (publicly listed) investment universe. It only ever traded (1) when the #1 stock changed, and (2) to reinvest dividends. Very few trades reduces holding costs to a minimum.\n\nToday, the all in fund would hold 100% AAPL.\n\n5 years ago, it held 100% MSFT.\n\nIn 1990, it held 100% XOM.\n\n[https://www.finhacker.cz/top-20-sp-500-companies-by-market-cap/](https://www.finhacker.cz/top-20-sp-500-companies-by-market-cap/)\n\nWould the fund have a better return than, say, the FTSE All-World, or the S&P 500? I expect the standard deviation to be (a lot) higher, but which would risk return ratios - Sortino, Martin, ... - favour?\n\nUPDATE\n\nMy thanks to [these commenters](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1e5k8n6/comment/ldnyi7b/). Price return for the All In Index is easy to calculate. For the period 1990 - 2024 I get 12% PR annualized. Compared to 8% PR for the S&P 500.\n\nThe current beta for AAPL is 1.24. The Sharpe ratio is thus > 20% better.\n\nMy intuition for this question came from the statistical idea of representation. If there are any fund managers reading this, my DMs are always open.",

I am not sure I would hang on to this strategy long term but instead wait to see if it can get over 100k and cash out and then go down to more of a Medium Risk - if I went this route.\n\n**Medium Risk - Tech Heavy with some ETFs**\n\nHeavy with some of the big tech like AAPL, NVDA, MSFT, AMD, etc.... along with some funds like SPY, QQQ and SCHD.  This one feels like it could go very well in the next 5-10 years if tech and AI continue to be the forefront of the conversation.  It's still not really that diversified but feels like it could maximize returns on the happy path.\n\n**Low Risk - Retirement centric 2030 or 2035 target funds** \n\nAlmost completely fund based where the investments could be spread amongst a few funds that are 2030 or 2035 target retirement funds and would have the requisite risk associated with retiring in the near term.",

    "selftext": "KEY POINTS\n\n* Microsoft and Nvidia will likely have a weight of around 21% in this tech ETF, while Apple will be down to about 4.5%, according to Matthew Bartolini, head of SPDR Americas Research.\n* The rebalance will be in effect for one quarter, even if Apple outperforms Nvidia significantly ahead of the official date.\n* The ETF has about $71 billion in assets under management, so a 15-percentage-point change in the fund equates to more than $10 billion.\n\n\n\n[Nvidia](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/NVDA/)\u2019s blistering rally will force a major technology exchange-traded fund to acquire more than $10 billion worth of shares of the chip giant while cutting dramatically back on\u00a0[Apple](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AAPL/).\n\nThe index that the\u00a0[Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK)](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/XLK/)\u00a0follows will soon rebalance, based on an adjusted market cap value from Friday\u2019s close. The new calculations show\u00a0[Microsoft](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/MSFT/)\u00a0as the top stock in the index, followed by Nvidia and then Apple, according to Matthew Bartolini, head of SPDR Americas Research.\n\nAll three stocks would have a weight above 20% in the index if there were not caps in place. But diversification rules for the index limit how big the cumulative weight of stocks with at least a 5% share of the fund can be.\n\nAs a result, Microsoft and Nvidia will likely have a weight of around 21%, while Apple will fall sharply to about 4.5%, Bartolini said.\n\nThat is a change from the prior weightings, which saw Nvidia\u2019s weight be kept artificially low by index rules. As of June 14, Microsoft and Apple were both at about 22% each in the fund, while Nvidia was just 6%.\n\n  \nThe race to finish in the top two came down to the final day. As of Monday, market cap data from FactSet shows that all three companies are over $3.2 trillion and within $50 million of each other, though that data does differ slightly from the calculations used in the index.\n\nThe XLK has about $71 billion in assets under management, so a 15-percentage-point change in the fund equates to more than $10 billion. SPDR does not comment on specific trading strategies around rebalances.\n\nThe big shift in the XLK is an extreme example of how even passive index funds can diverge, especially when focusing on narrow slices of the market.\n\n\u201cUnderstanding how they might be weighted, where they\u2019re allocated, what the rebalance frequency is, is really important because it can create differences in exposures and make what\u2019s beneath the label seem different from fund to fund,\u201d Bartolini said.\n\nThe fund follows the Technology Select Sector Index from S&P Dow Jones Indices, which uses a float-adjusted calculation to determine market cap. The rebalance officially takes effect at the end of this week.\n\nThe free-float adjustment for market cap accounts for large holders of an individual stock that are unlikely to be trading on a daily basis. For example, Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway owns more than 5% of Apple, which could count against it in the index, Bartolini said.\n\n\u201cIts free-float market capitalization is reduced because you have so many controlled interests in the company,\u201d Bartolini said.\n\nThe rebalance will be in effect for one quarter, even if Apple outperforms Nvidia significantly ahead of the official date.\n\nOn Monday, shares of Apple were up 1.8%, while Nvidia ticked up 0.2%.\n\n[https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/17/nvidia-to-get-20percent-weighting-and-billions-in-investor-demand-while-apple-demoted-in-major-tech-fund.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/17/nvidia-to-get-20percent-weighting-and-billions-in-investor-demand-while-apple-demoted-in-major-tech-fund.html)",

I have come up to reasonable speed on stocks but I don't quite understand how bonds work. I do understand the (arguable, it seems) premise that bonds are generally less volatile than stocks and so are a balancing force in a portfolio. However, my question is: specifically -- 2 big chunks (30%) of my brokerage account are bond funds -- MTBIX and WMBIX. For the past 10 years at least these fund shares gone up and down by only a couple dollars (e.g. $8 to $10), as does their total gain/loss, however every month I get a non-taxable distribution from them which I've set up to reinvest. Is that basically how bonds work - you hold them and get regular (tax free) distributions from them? \n\nWhat I'm really trying to determine is should I keep these funds or sell them off to invest more in some basic ETFs instead. The rest of my brokerage portfolio is 60% in popular ETFs like VOO, SPYG, QQQ, SMH, and the rest in a handful of large-cap tech stocks -- AMZN, MSFT, NVDA, APPL. I should mention my 401k is quite broadly diversified across asset classes with 50% in equities the rest in fixed, guaranteed, bonds, REITs. \n\nI'm fairly comfortable I have enough cheddar in my combined brokerage and 401k accounts to fund my remaining retirement even through volatile market periods, but I'm just not clear if these 2 bond funds fit into my more risky brokerage account beyond just added stability and tax benefits, given my 401k is already fairly conservative and 65% of my overall investments.\n\nAny thoughts or education on this most appreciated!

Insight\u00a0\n2. Conviction\u00a0\n3. Patience\n\n**Insight**\n\nI\u2019ve learned to largely ignore headlines and talking heads, which seem more reactionary than insightful and optimizing for entertainment (clicks/views).\u00a0\n\nBen Graham\u2019s quote rings true:\u00a0\n\n>\u201cIn the short run, the market is a voting machine but in the long run, it is a weighing machine.\u201d\n\nPerhaps counterintuitively, I\u2019ve found it more useful to read/listen to tech/business analysts who focus on strategy and how that interacts with macro trends (along with financials) than solely financial analysts and stock pickers.\u00a0\n\nFinancials are a good indicator of fundamentals, but are backward-looking. However, valuation is forward-looking, thus driven by strategy x trends x structural advantages, so we must consider both.\u00a0\n\n# Math\n\nIn 2023 I also started\u00a0practicing math daily\u00a0(243 days straight\u00a0as of this morning) in order to better understand the mathematics behind AI. As part of that, I had to take remedial coursework to build my foundations since it had been so long since I\u2019d done any meaningful math.\u00a0\n\nI\u2019m not sure how much, but it\u00a0*feels*\u00a0like it helped with the reallocation decisions I made in late 2023 and early 2024. I felt more confident and deliberate in making trades. The math journey has been quite challenging, but personally rewarding, whether it has helped or not.\u00a0\n\n**Conviction**\n\nA big part of this is just a better understanding of myself and what kind of investor I am. I invest in what I believe in long-term.\u00a0\n\nHowever, someone trading on volatility with a much shorter timeline may not care about conviction. You must understand what investment philosophy aligns with your psychology and your strengths.\u00a0\n\nConviction investing works for me because, even when building products (my day job), I\u2019ve always been strong with product vision/strategy and always building for the future, so it makes sense that I invest the same way. I\u2019m not sure why it took me so long to connect those dots, but I\u2019m happy I did.\u00a0\n\nA big part of this is also timing. AI seems to be a once-in-a-generation opportunity. Whereas 5 years ago I might have tried to force myself to believe crypto was the next big thing in the absence of anything substantial.\u00a0\n\nThis is another reminder that success (in investing or otherwise) is all about timing and opportunity. When opportunities arise,\u00a0you must seize them.\n\n**Patience**\n\nAs a result of my convictions, I\u2019m much more patient in my investing these days and don\u2019t react to the day-to-day.\u00a0\n\nI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if I don\u2019t make another trade for the rest of 2024.\n\n**UPDATE:**\n\nA commenter asked about benchmarks, which I failed to include since I don't pay attention to them, so I had to look it up:\n\nI opened my portfolio in June 2022. Since then the cumulative S&P return is \\~28% (\\~39% for Nasdaq). My cumulative return for that same period is around \\~215%. The annual rate of return (per my Vanguard dashboard) is 77.9% as mentioned in the original post. I would expect my returns to revert to the mean over time.",

For all that time, I never felt the urge to venture into other investments until the recent buzz surrounding AI. Like everyone else, I was wowed by NVDA's stellar performance, just as AAPL seemed to hit a plateau and face some challenges.  \nAs a result, I offloaded half of my AAPL in November for NVDA. Come January, I found myself questioning why I hadn't just sold the whole lot, especially considering that one's growth trajectory was bound to outshine the other in the same timeframe. However, by then, NVDA had already nearly doubled. This prompted me to scrutinize the market more closely, leading to selling off the remaining half of my AAPL and diversifying my portfolio.  \nToday, here's where I stand:  \n\\- 61% NVDA  \n\\- 11% SMTC  \n\\- 9% MSFT  \n\\- 6% ORCL  \n\\- 6% MU  \n\\- 3% MRVL  \n\\- 2.5% AMD  \n\\- 2.5% PLTR  \nFirst off, I'm keen to hear your take on this mix of investments. Secondly, I'm pondering why I opted for seven different stocks instead of going all-in on NVDA, much like I did with AAPL in 2008. Let's be clear: I chose these stocks because I believe they offer reasonable profit prospects over a 3 to 5-year window for the entire portfolio. However, I'm still convinced that within a one-year timeframe, NVDA is likely to outperform the rest.  \nBottom line: Did I make the sensible move by diversifying across different stocks, or does my gut feeling that I should focus on the big player hold merit?",

The initiative includes the development of an artificial intelligence supercomputer named \"Stargate.\" While the companies have not officially commented on the project, sources suggest that Microsoft will likely finance it. Stargate is anticipated to be operational by 2028, marking the final phase of OpenAI's AI upgrade. This U.S.-based supercomputer is part of a series of installations planned over the next six years. The projected cost of $100 billion has been attributed to conversations with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Microsoft's initial cost estimates. The project is progressing through five phases, with Stargate as the fifth phase, while Microsoft is concurrently working on a smaller, fourth-phase supercomputer for OpenAI. The focus of the current phase is on procuring AI chips necessary for the subsequent phases.\r  \n\r  \nLINK:\r  \n\r  \nhttps://www.nasdaq.com/articles/microsoft-and-openai-planning-$100-billion-data-center-project-the-information-reports",

I\u2019m currently in the compulsory national service in my country and am getting around 1k USD each month. I\u2019ve talked with him and his advice boils down to either buying individual stocks that I am confident in / or 50-50 in ETF/index funds such as SPY, QQQ ,and individual stocks like AMZN, MSFT, AMD, TSM. \n\nHe did tell me what I should choose from the two should also be determined by my risk appetite, asking if I\u2019m the type to lose sleep at night if my stocks don\u2019t well.\n\nI\u2019m here to discuss with you guys to get some perspective on the advice given and how you look at it. I\u2019m not here asking on what I should be doing but just here to talk and have others opinions and look at this advice from a bigger perspective.\n\nThanks for your time and input!\n\n\n",

    "selftext": "So apparently if you move to certain European countries, they will punitively tax the fuck out of your American index fund holdings (Apparently the US does the same to Americans holding foreign index funds'). After talking to a bunch of other expats in similar situations, one solution people have suggested is to buy individual stocks that approximately represent the desired index fund's composition. This could mean for eg. buying the top 10-15 stocks from lets say VTSAX.\n\nNow my question to y'all who can VTSAX and chill without the taxman calling: How hard would it be for me to recreate it approximately? \n\n1.  How likely am I to get in the earnings ballpark by holding the top 10-15 VTSAX stocks ?\n\n2. Would a twice a year rebalancing be enough?\n\n3. What would the rebalancing entail? I imagine its something like \n   1.  Find out what percentage of VTSAX is MSFT\n   2.  Find out what percentage of my portfolio is MSFT\n   3. Calculate difference in terms of stock units\n   4. Buy or sell # of stock units on difference\n   5. Repeat 10-15x based on holdings\n\n    This doesnt sound like my idea of a fun evening but ya gotta do what ya gotta do.",

This time, I want to do it better. I got a couple Amazon just after they split the stocks cause it's amazon (no reason it'll go sideways and if it got expensive after previous splits, it likely has the protocols/processes/structure/whatever to do it again), a couple JD because analysts (Td ameritrade, motley fool, etc--I'm selling it cause it just loses for me and I need a different way to eval stocks) and a couple Verizon because dividend. This is all low amounts cause student life. Now, I'm thinking of adding $450ish to amazon and splitting the rest between VOO and MSFT. The goal is to just get one of each so when I get an income in July, I can just add to what I have instead of seeking other stocks cause I likely won't have time to do that with any consistency until 2025 earliest.

    "title": "The NYTs is suing Microsoft and I think there is a profitability play on their stocks",
    "selftext": "What Happened\nHeadlines yesterday were championed by the largest copyright lawsuit in the Manhattan Federal Court: The New York Times sues Microsoft and OpenAI. The copyright infringement lawsuit against the companies says that both used the newspaper\u2019s content to train their models without permission. In doing so, the companies jeopardized Time\u2019s business in its entirety. The Times also suggested in the filing that both companies should be liable for BILLIONS of damages. What prompted the lawsuit? Failed negotiations between the involved parties over the usage of Times material. They also stated they were worried about AI attributing false information to the newspaper. I guess when money is on the line news outlets decide to worry about whether their information is accurate or not. Now here is the real kicker - the Times is calling for both OpenAI and Microsoft to destroy all chatbots that use Times material. With OpenAI\u2019s valuation, currently over $80 bn, coming almost completely from ChatGPT, this could compromise the integrity of the entire company. \n\nThe Simple Sides (My) Take\nThe bad news is that I am not a legal professional and truly have no idea how this will go. While I do hold my own opinions, I have reached out to multiple lawyers to get more professional opinions and will be sure to add them here when they respond. In the meantime let\u2019s jump into a couple of completely feasible outcomes. \n\nThe entire lawsuit is kaput: a.k.a, insignificant or thrown out \nTo me, this lawsuit is somewhat of a joke: \u201cNewspaper upset that companies use articles available online.\u201d I honestly DO NOT think the lawsuit will amount to much. It seems like journalists at the Times are worried that they are going to lose money and jobs to AI and aren\u2019t happy about it - rightfully so. However, being scared and upset about AI replacing you isn\u2019t a good reason to cry out to the long arm of the law. When the case gets underway it will be interesting to see the arguments presented by the legal team for the Times. \n\nThe New York Times wins the lawsuit\nIf the Times wins the lawsuit it could be a major step in journalism\u2019s fight against AI. Not only would the victory set a legal precedent for future AI copyright cases, but it would mean significant damages being paid to the Times. They (the Times) could come into billions of dollars, possibly boosting the stock (ticker: NYT) to 52-week highs. This could also lead to a revaluation of the AI industry. If websites can \u201ccharge\u201d for AI models training on their information, the profitability scales might shift. The more content you have online the more you could capitalize on AI models. AI companies are also not heavily regulated at the moment. A win for the Times could shift lawmakers\u2019 attention to the growing market sector.\n\nMicrosoft and OpenAI win the lawsuit \nSimilar to if the Times won, there would be a legal precedent set - AI models can be trained on any information. This could also reinforce the current AI industry and lead to possible growth in valuations for AI-invested stocks. The New York Times would also likely experience some negative effects, possibly paying lawyer fees for both defendants. In layman\u2019s terms, Microsoft stock would be soaring up and the New York Times would be diving down. \n\nStock Movements Based on Lawsuit Outcomes\nWe see the MSFT and NYT stocks moving in all sorts of directions depending on the outcome of the pending lawsuit. No need to worry, you\u2019re reading The Simple Side, so we\u2019re gonna break it down for you. If nothing happens and the lawsuit is thrown out then Microsoft might suffer some residual damage from the negative headlines, but the stock price will remain relatively steady. If the New York Times wins then its stock will likely jump up probably both in the short and mid-term, but Microsoft will likely have a significant short-term drop. If Microsoft wins then its stock will jump in both the short and mid-to-long-term, whereas the Times stock will drop in the short term and likely recover within the mid-term.\n\nCould capitalize using options trade strategies. I wrote a full article about this and the profitability of the trades but out of respect for the \u201cno promotion\u201d sub guidelines I can\u2019t post links. GOOD LUCK OUT THERE INVESTORS!",

    "selftext": "I always had this logic if I invest long enough into Reits I would be able to retire with dividends wiithout withdrawing.\n\nLots of people say once snowball begins you really feel the power of dividends.\n\nI have another 35 years before retirement anyway and residency is UK but more and more doing calculations of profit after each year finish I realise dividends is like fake hope. For example first year my dividends payout was \u00a316.43. This year is \u00a3900 range and next year projected \u00a31400 which seems good on paper but these very dividends stock could have been replaced with growth and instead of small realized gains I would of had way more unrealised gains.\n\nBut more on reits there is even research that Reits most years outperform SP500 due to the power of reinvesting dividends but after holding\nVici (risk but growth) Realty Income (passive but monthly dividend and super diversified) I realised they are both very passive boring stocks both together are 15% of my portfolio.\n\nOf course during high interest rates you wouldnt expect Reits to be exciting but I just did future conservative calculations and slightly doubt whether its even worth holding Reits. Posting here whether I missed something from my calculations that makes it so one sided\n\nLike the way I see snowball effect is when it's growth is  exponential and I thought if for example Realty Income pays you \u00a345 per month that would be enough to buy 1 whole share right  so calculations are you need 264 shares which is \u00a311,880\n\n\nYear 1 \n264 shares +\u00a345 dividend monthly\nMonth 1 \n264+45\nMonth 2\n265+45.05\nMonth 3\n266+45.22\nMonth 4\n267+45.39\nMonth 5\n268+45.56\nMonth 6\n269+45.73\nMonth 7\n270+45.9\nMonth 8\n271+46.07\nMonth 9\n272+46.24\nMonth 10\n273 +46.41\nMonth 11\n274 +46.58\nMonth 12\n275 +46.75\n\n1 year from \n264 shares =11,880\n\nTo\n11,880 +3% annual growth =12,236\n+reinvested shares 11 =495\n=12,731\n7.2% growth\n\nBut if invested in growth stock \n11,880 +20%\n1 year =14,256\n\n\nSo I thought snowball effect doesn't really happen with 11k into Reits but what if I was able to buy 4 Realty Income shares every month is that snowball effect?\n\n\n\u00a357,000 = 1266 shares\n=\u00a3215.22 per month gives you 4.7 shares at current price\n\nYear 1\n1266 shares +\u00a3215 dividend monthly\nMonth 1\n1266+215\nMonth 2\n1270.7+216\nMonth 3\n1275.5+216.8\nMonth 4\n1280.3+217.6\nMonth 5\n1285.1+218.4\nMonth 6\n1289.9+219.2\nMonth 7\n1294.7+220.1\nMonth 8\n1299.59+220.93\nMonth 9\n1304.4+221.7\nMonth 10\n1309.3+222.5\nMonth 11\n1314.2+223.4\nMonth 12\n1319.1+224.2\n\nAfter year 1\n57000 1266 shares\nTo\n57000+3% annual growth =58,710\n+53 shares reinvested \u00a32385\n61095\n7.2% growth\n\nIf invested in VUSA\n10% annual growth\n57000+10% =62700\nPlus dividends \u00a3772 per year\n63,475\n11.5% growth\n\nOnly reason I chose Realty Income is because it's extremely safe stable diversified stock pays 5% but even with 60k invested I still don't see snowball effect of course everyone says just put it into VUSA and forget but dividend investors talk about how they can outperform sp500 but I don't see whether its even worth trying \n\nMaybe in your last 5 years employed you start exchanging your growth stocks and ETFs for Reits for passive Income but slowly I realized recently, investing into passive dividend stocks while young is a big waste of time and illusion to provide passive Income that isn't there. You can compare year 1 dividends received to current year and say wow snowball effect is real but when you take into consideration on how much growth you missed out. Makes me feel my investing strategy has been used 30 years too early \n\nEven when my portfolio consist of 55% Apple & MSFT just mistakes like TROW DIS SOFI my portfolio every year for 5 years is 3-7% lower than VUSA. Even though stock picking is fun but it really is true VUSA seems the only hassle-stress free strategy. Don't need to readjust anything, don't need to check earnings and new competitors or sales it's so simple. Anyone else had these realizations and just want to sell everything and buy VUSA and relax with DRIP? Or do you keep believing \n\n\n\n\nTL:DR dividend investing and stock picking is counter-productive new year resolution VUSA",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone, I have a question regarding generating income to allow myself to contribute to my Roth IRA. For context I\u2019m currently in graduate school and am no longer working. The past two years I\u2019ve worked and been able to max out my Roth contributions while not making enough to be taxed when filing. I currently have ~35000 dollars in a brokerage account. I have made 808 taxable dollars in dividends and that is my only income for the year. I would like to try and contribute more than that. So I was wondering if it is possible (legal?) to sell all of my current long term investments that are positive then reinvest them. If I did this I would net ~5200 as income bumping me up to around 6000 to contribute to my Roth. Am I allowed to just sell my current gains and repurchase their positions, or does that form a sort of wash for tax purposes? If not could I potentially pivot to different holdings? If that is possible is there any other way I could generate the extra 500$ dollars of apparent income to max my contribution? Thanks in advance. \n\nHoldings in question for sale would be \nMsft\nAAPL\nSpy \nNOW\nQqq\nVGT",

All of Genomics, Drug Development, Space, 3D printing etc. are bleeding money by double digit percentages every year. Manufacturing companies are slowly revolutionizing, but I don't see their market expanding in a fashion that lets their stocks explode.

Meme stocks aren't investments, it's gambling.\n\nTo me, genomics, drones (military) and surveillance are going to explode 10x at least in the next 10 years. I know founders in each of them, and have a strong intuition for the base technology. Not approaching it from a 'shiny new thing' perspective.

Got the loan as wife doesn't have full cash on hand and I'd rather have a slow trickle from my account rater than large lump sum payout. \n\nGot Robinhood in 2020 and quickly realized I have no idea what I'm really doing. Most of my money  is in ETFs but I think there's a fair amount of redundancy in my holdings and I'd probably benefit from consolidating. Some accounts are positive, some negative.

Already maxing IRA and 401k so I consider my stocks to be more of a \"reserve\" account, ideally for long term growth but also access to additional funds if needed. Biggest fear I guess would be income stays low for a while while I figure things out, market tanks, now I'm selling stocks for pennies on the dollar to get by.\n\nMy thoughts/plan:\n\nSell off DAL, C, NDAQ, TAN, ICLN, & SCHD for a total of $9,153 and net loss of $289. This should cover most of the additional housing expenses and minimize losses.\n\nBut what would you do from there, especially if I'm anticipating a big reduction in income for the next 6 months?  Been considering selling everything besides (V)ETFs and then shaving off additional equity as needed but idk if that would be most prudent. \n\nThanks in advance. Didn't mean for this to turn into a text wall.",

My question is when I sell the shares next year to pay LLC taxes, if I only sell enough to recoup my original investment, and leave the profit earned in the market, am I off the hook for capital gains taxes or some other penalty? So, say I put $10k in the market, and it goes to $12k, and then in April I sell $10k worth to pay taxes and leave the 2K profit in the market long-term, what are the tax implications?

TSLA may also see a small downward weighting. Smaller stocks should see a small increase in the weight.\n\nETFs/mutual funds that try to follow the Nasdaq 100 (such as $QQQ) will need to adjust their holdings accordingly. So you should expect them to sell the largest stocks and buy the smaller ones -- perhaps they already have -- and that will affect the prices of those stocks accordingly.\n\nIt also means that those ETFs/mutual funds will not accurately reflect the relative weight of the largest stocks. So if you wish to be weighted according to actual market cap, you would need to supplement those holdings.\n\nNormally the index rebalances every quarter. But the largest stocks are dominating the index and funds that follow the index need to maintain compliance with a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rule on fund diversification. On July 3, the largest six stocks saw their combined weight reach 50.9% of the index.\n\nRead more in this [Reuters \"Explainer\"](https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/what-is-nasdaqs-special-rebalancing-its-impact-2023-07-11/) or [Bloomberg article](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-10/big-tech-s-dominance-in-stock-market-hits-breaking-point-for-nasdaq-100) (paywall) or Matt Levine's [Money Stuff newsletter](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2023-07-11/matt-levine-s-money-stuff-elon-musk-blames-the-lawyers) (paywall/signup)",

    "selftext": "With AI being the new hot topic out there, we see so many companies investing a lot of resources in R&D hoping for a big breakthrough. While it is normal to see emerging companies being innovative and investors looking for opportunities, it can also be seen that companies such as MSFT, GOOGL, AAPL, AMZN are heavily invested into the idea, particularly MSFT with its continuous investment into OpenAI.\n\nI don't see AI being an investment fad, for a lack of a better term, like it can be argued that blockchain, cryptocurrencies or NFTs were at some point. With that, I am mostly referring to ordinary investors that would invest in such assets on a long-term basis rather than traders looking for large returns with any of the financial instruments at their disposal.\n\nGiven the fact that the companies mentioned above already represent a fair share of the S&P 500 index, is it safe to assume that any potential global breakthrough in AI is going to affect the value of any relevant ETFs since we do not know which of those major companies is going to be the first/best to reap the benefits of AI? Or the more risky approach of picking stocks like MSFT and emerging companies is more likely to be more profitable?\n\nSome may argue that a breakthrough in AI R&D is imminent but that it might actually result in a dot-com bubble-like crash because the current market prices have already factored in the expectation of larger returns which may or may not actually happen with AI.\n\nIn a nutshell, can S&P 500 ETF investing reap the benefits of a potential AI revolution or investors still have to take the risk and pick individual stocks? Can a crash of S&P 500 value be expected because some sectors could potentially lose value with AI or the prices are already too ambitious with some expectations on AI?",

    "selftext": "I will start saying that MSFT investors are now less impressed and starting to worry. Google killed it yesterday at the conference. They have integrated AI into their G-Suite (Gmail, Google Docs and sheet), search engine and a bunch of other tools that I don't even know what the heck they are but they sure are cool.\n\nGoogle could become the leading \"trustworthy\" AI company everyone is looking at. I was a little worried about this Zuckertard 2.0 named Sam Altman, who talks like a freaking robot and who the hell knows what he's doing with your data (yeah, you haven't read his terms when you signed up). None of his back and forth podcasts in the last few months convinced me, more like made him suspicious.\n\nSundra Pichai said yesterday that Google will meta tag all AI-created images from day 1, including a nice watermark on them. Also, it launched a fact check tool to find out if the content or news is misleading or not (the big concern with all this AI boom)\n\nI have already seen a few dangerous applications our there. For example some people on LinkedIn happy with many new releases that are illegal under the Data Privacy Act. Things like you can use an AI website where you put a name and it gives you a lot of social media information about this person, or prompt the AI the profile you need to recruit and it will pull up a lot of profiles with photos, information from career, social media information of candidates who are suitable, with their email addresses. I never authorized my profile to be on these AI sites other than LinkedIn (which I kept private and visible only to HR profiles), and now my profile, picture, and info. \n\nGoogle will become the voice politicians, regulators and society is looking at. Beucaseu they are in the business since the late 90's. They know what regulations means. They went through a lot of issues, solved them and survived. \n\nI hold a ton of share in Google and this is not a financial advice.",

    "selftext": "I'm developing an application related to ETF portfolios (the goal is to be able to analyze intersection, diversification between countries, categories, portfolio trend \\[small to large, value to growth map\\], etc).\n\nAnyway. An ETF that I really like is **AVGE**, from Avantis. If I could summarize it in a few words, it would be the \"VT with tendency to the value factor\". It is a \"fund of funds\" with the following composition:\n\n* Avantis U.S. Equity ETF (42.78%)\n* Avantis U.S. Large Cap Value ETF (15.05%)\n* Avantis International Equity ETF (10.89%)\n* Avantis Emerging Markets Equity ETF (6.37%)\n* Avantis International Large Cap Value ETF (5.49%)\n* Avantis U.S. Small Cap Value ETF (4.95%)\n* Avantis U.S Small Cap Equity ETF (4.86%)\n* Avantis Emerging Markets Value ETF (4.28%)\n* Avantis Real Estate ETF (3.00%)\n* Avantis International Small Cap Value ETF (2.17%)\n* State Street Institutional Investment Trust US Government Money Market Fund Institutional (0.09%)\n\nI got this information from the website [etf.com/avge](https://etf.com/avge). But I would like to go further. I would not like to see the funds that make up these funds, I want to see the holdings that make up the funds of that fund.\n\nSo, with a little bit of programming I was able to extract this information and publish it in this github repository. There are two CSV, of which:\n\n* [avge-holdings-ungrouped.csv](https://github.com/victornoleto/avge-holdings/blob/master/avge-holdings-ungrouped.csv): In this CSV I have not grouped the repeated companies. You will be able to see the weight of each holding in each of the funds. Example: APPL represents 4.78% of AVUS (which represents 42.78% of AVGE) and at the same time represents 2.98% of AVLV (which represents 15.05% of AVGE).\n* [avge-holdings-grouped.csv](https://github.com/victornoleto/avge-holdings/blob/master/avge-holdings-grouped.csv): This CSV shows the actual participation of a given company in AVGE. So, for example, the APPL that is part of AVUS and AVLG, its real weight is 2.49% (4.78%\\*42.78% + 2.98%\\*15.05%).\n\nAnd, just to make the post more graphic, I end with the list of the 10 biggest AVGE positions.\n\n|Name|Ticker|Weight|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Apple Inc.|AAPL|2.49%|\n|Microsoft Corporation|MSFT|1.56%|\n|Exxon Mobil Corporation|XOM|0.92%|\n|Meta Platforms Inc. Class A|META|0.85%|\n|JPMorgan Chase & Co|JPM|0.80%|\n|Chevron Corporation|CVX|0.77%|\n|Merck & Co., Inc|MRK|0.76%|\n|Alphabet Inc. Class A|GOOGL|0.63%|\n|Pfizer Inc|PFE|0.56%|\n|Alphabet Inc. Class C|GOOG|0.55%|\n\nThe fund's 10 largest positions add up to **9.91%**. It's a pretty small value when compared to growth ETFs like QQQ, VUG, etc.\n\n# Next goals (which I will do when I have time):\n\n* Compare the percentage portfolio between AVGE and VT;\n* Get the country and sector of each of the 9824 holdings. In this way I will be able to carry out a study of the geographic and sectorial diversification of AVGE. I'll probably use ChatGPT to help me with this because I haven't found any api that can give me this information easily.",

    "selftext": "Below, I'm offering up the sectors  that I believe have the greatest potential for improved financial  performance, as well as those that may disappoint investors.\n\nI expect an increase in financial performance in the following areas:\n\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 Technology: Primarily, companies specializing in AI and hardware production.\n\n\u25aa **Nvidia (NVDA)** graphics cards remain highly popular among users, while **Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)** and **Intel (INTC)** may also signal a recovery in demand. AI product creators **Alphabet (GOOG)** and **Microsoft (MSFT)** could also see increased demand for their products in the coming quarters, boosting profits.\n\n2\ufe0f\u20e3  Cryptocurrency companies: Rising prices for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and  other coins are likely to boost profits from commissions for the **Coinbase** crypto exchange **(COIN)** and from the mining company **Marathon Digital (MARA)**.\n\n3\ufe0f\u20e3 Energy and precious metals mining:\n\n\u25aa Mineral prices (gold and silver) exhibited a growth trend in the reporting quarter. This could send profits for **Newmont (NEM)** and **Barrick Gold (GOLD)** soaring.\n\n\u25aa Increasing energy demand could result in higher revenues for **Peabody Energy (BTU)** and **Arch Resources (ARCH)**.\n\nLaggards:\n\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 Financial: Tightening credit conditions and deposit outflows are likely to primarily impact regional banks such as **First Republic Bank (FRC)**. Large banks, including those with investment banking divisions like **Bank of America (BAC)** and **JP Morgan (JPM)**,  could benefit from deposit inflows and increased asset values in the  stock market. However, the quality of their loan portfolios is  deteriorating, and reserves are growing.\n\nI'm not ready to add these shares to my portfolios, so I will continue to observe the dynamics of these stocks.\n\nAdditionally, the reports from **Wells Fargo (WFC)**, JP Morgan Chase, and **Citigroup (C)** showed decent results thanks to cost control and growth in net interest income.\n\n2\ufe0f\u20e3  Consumer: Stores, including online marketplaces, typically experience a  decline in demand in the 1st quarter following holiday sales. I  anticipate a drop in demand indicators from **Best Buy (BBY)**, **Walmart (WMT)**, **GAP (GPS)**, as well as **Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY)**, which faces bankruptcy.\n\n3\ufe0f\u20e3  Healthcare: The coronavirus pandemic and seasonal colds have subsided,  and the increased demand for drugs has dwindled. Medical companies such  as **Teva (TEVA)**, **Pfizer (PFE)**, and **Novavax (NVAX)** could increase spending on new drugs, which would impact shareholder returns negatively.\n\nConclusion:\n\nAdding  a sector to one list or another doesn't necessarily mean that after the  report is presented, all of the stocks in promising sectors will soar  while all of those in the laggard category will tank. Rather, these are  thoughts on on the medium- and long-term growth prospects of specific  sectors in my field of vision.",

It's very good background to understanding the power that is coming from the chat bots that are in development and how they may be deployed\n\nSome may note that last November Nvidia and Microsoft  [announced](https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-microsoft-accelerate-cloud-enterprise-ai) they would build a \"massive\" AI server utilizing Nvidia parts as their key compute engines.  Servicing Bing Chat is clearly what that massive server is about, at least initially.   Microsoft is clearly going after all the eyeballs Google has attracted, something on the order of **8 BILLION** searches a day.\n\nAs a thought exercise:  If Google's 8B searches are basically up for grabs, imagine for a moment how many other companies will need systems  that are competitive with Bing Chat.   Not just Google, but Facebook,  Apple, Amazon, Baidu, Tencent, Alibaba.    Then there are the second  tier guys, folks like IBM, and Oracle  and Salesforce.  And dozens of others in Europe, Asia, Australia etc.\n\nCircle back to the article referenced for a moment.  The author used the analogy that Chat\\_GPT was like a Ford Model T, and Bing Chat is like a 1968 Lincoln.   He then concludes a section:  \"And again:  This is a 1968 Lincoln. Just wait until the latest-model Tesla shows up.\"\n\nThis is what makes Nvidia a very compelling long term play.  They are building the guts to all those  Tesla-esque data centers that need to be built out.\n\n\"\\[NVIDIA\\] has a commanding share of high-end AI chips, accounting for about 86% of the [computing power](https://techwireasia.com/2022/11/nvidia-microsoft-collaborates-to-build-the-most-powerful-ai-supercomputers/) of the world\u2019s six largest cloud services as of last December, according to Jefferies chip analyst Mark Lipacis.\"  [https://techwireasia.com/2023/02/can-a-south-korean-startup-take-on-nvidia-in-the-ai-chips-market/](https://techwireasia.com/2023/02/can-a-south-korean-startup-take-on-nvidia-in-the-ai-chips-market/)\n\nGoogle and Microsoft may have \"the data\" to be leadership in AI.  But they haven't yet touched gloves while the opening bell is still reverberating on what is certain to be a 15 round cage match with a number of other 800 lb gorillas.   Nvidia on the other hand earned [$14.5B revenue](https://s201.q4cdn.com/141608511/files/doc_financials/2023/q3/Rev_by_Mkt_Qtrly_Trend_Q323.pdf) TTM on data center hardware -- primarily focused on AI training and inferencing.

    "selftext": "I'm looking to create a portfolio with relatively safe tech growth stocks. I know that sounds like a bit of an oxymoron, but I'm looking to diversify out of my AAPL position. 77% of my portfolio is in the s&p 500. The rest is in AAPL.\n\nI don't think AAPL is going anywhere, and they obviously have a loyal customer base and I think Apple TV is putting out some great content. I also love how vertically integrated they are. That being said, I think they've reached market saturation in most areas and it seems the pace of innovation has slowed. I'm thinking about selling 50%+ of my AAPL position because over the years it has grown to represent 23% of my portfolio and that just seems like too much for any one individual stock.\n\nI'm considering divesting and reallocating into the following positions:\n\nGOOGL\nMSFT\nAMZN\nTSM\nNVDA\nMETA\nTSLA\n\n1. Google needs no introduction, but the stock is at super low p/e ratios and they continuously try (mostly unsuccessfully) to innovate across multiple sectors. Ads are obviously the bread and butter, but YouTube is the biggest threat to cable and streaming services. YouTube content is vast, high quality, and free!\n\n2. Microsoft is also at pretty low p/e ratios. Azure is #2 cloud service. Gaming sector is growing and Sony/PlayStation is falling behind. Biggest thing for me is their investment into AI tech such as OpenAI (aka chatGPT). Overall they have diverse revenue streams and continue to innovate.\n\n3. Amazon is not just ecommerce, but at absolute logistics giant. #1 cloud service. Decent streaming service. And they continuously reinvest into the company. They're also down more than others on this list in the past year.\n\n4. Taiwanese Semiconductor is the world's leading chip manufacturer. P/e is low, but partly because of inflated chip prices. Biggest fear is Chinese government interference, but the $40 billion investment into the Arizona factory is encouraging.\n\n5. Nvidia makes the most powerful chips in the world and has great partnerships with other leaders in tech. Also one of the leaders in AI technology. Downside is sky high p/e and it's down the least over the last year, so not the best value.\n\n6. META for me is the hardest to evaluate. On one hand Facebook and Instagram are absolute social media giants that print money, but on the other hand I don't see nearly as much potential for growth. VR technology is cool, but it's a long way away from being mainstream. If that ever happens, there's no guarantee that META will be the ones to do it.\n\n7. Tesla has obviously been hammered the most on this list, but I'm not sure it's totally warranted. Whatever Musk is doing at Twitter shouldn't really affect Tesla as much as it has. P/e ratio is back to reality somewhat and they continue to lead ev sales. Other manufacturers are struggling to catch up, it's happening, but much slower than anyone expected. If Tesla continues to keep it's foot on the gas and continues to improve it's qc and manufacturing processes, I see them remaining a leader in the ev field for years to come.\n\n\nSo Reddit, what do you think of my choices? And are there any other companies you think I missed and should look into? What percentage would you allocate into the above companies?",

    "title": "How to Decide on a \"Reasonable\" Growth Rate Relative to a Multiple",
    "selftext": "I see lots of comments when companies report about how they're trading at a premium relative to their growth. For example, I'll see people saying stuff like, \"who wants to pay 25x multiple on MSFT when it's only growing at 3%\" or something along those lines (don't quote me on exact numbers).\n\nI'm familiar with the concept of earnings yield (i.e. I'm paying $25 for every $1 of earnings MSFT earns per share, which is effectively 4%). Is this what people are talking about (i.e. I'd need at least 4% growth at 25x while MSFT is only growing at 3%) or something else? That example doesn't pass the smell test because it's only off by 1% if it's earnings yield, and 25x is generally a premium to the market's overall multiple. I'd imagine you'd need way more than just 4% earnings growth for a PE of 25, correct?",

Obviously both got hammered this year, especially NVDA which lost half its value.\n\nI wasn't holding onto these stocks for any good reason (MSFT is my employer and I just never bothered to sell vested shares, and I bought NVDA on a whim because of the hype).\n\nGoing forward, I plan to shift everything into index funds. But would it be a bad idea to sell off everything right now given how much they are down? Reluctant to do that because that would lock in huge losses when these two stocks will probably recover in the long run. Not sure if that idea is rational though. What would be the correct move here?",

But since then I learned more about index/mutual funds and how I can minimize my risk that way.\n\nSince stock market is down now, I thought about selling my loss and buying index/mutual funds like SP500 with a thinking that those index/mutual funds will have more chance to grow faster than the individual stocks. I understand that I will sell for loss and there is still risk involved even when buying index/mutual funds.\n\nWhat do you think of this thought process?

    "selftext": "Title says all, but truthfully don't know who to ask so this place seems like a good place to throw some ideas around.  \n\nMy current portfolio is currently and only concentrated in 7 stocks, there's a fair bit of diversity in it but it's mainly weighted on tech.  I'll give a list for what I got and my reasoning for each, beyond the obvious that tech seems here to stay for many years (which is my goal for these accounts, retirement).  \n\n1.  AMD - Makes excellent processors, seems to be if not already beating Intel in market share and technology due to their head start with their newer CPUs.  \n2.  MSFT - I don't think this needs elaboration.\n3.  RTX - Government defense contracts are a big reason, but they also own United Technologies now, which is a big manufacturer for HVAC components among other things, and in the future I see HVAC use trending upwards (if nothing else climate change will make things way hotter).  \n4.  TFC - Truist Financial, This is my bank is is actually a regional bank.  But they are also the 10th largest bank in the US with assets ($509 Billion).  Stock is just solid.  \n5.  TSM - They contract with both Intel and AMD for their processors.  So if nothing else, if Intel and AMD should fail, either move the losses to TSM or just get out of tech in general.  China poses a potential issue but I see this is a non-issue due to the rest of the world's reliance on Taiwan for their semiconductor production.  \n6.  VZ - Telecommunications company, I picked it over AT&T because it has far less debt.  This is the dividend stock of the group.  \n7.  WMG - Warner Music Group, I would have rather picked UMG but they're not public.  Music royalties mainly,  they have quite a few artist I like in their catalog.  \n\nNow, a preface:  should this be taken as due diligence for anyone?  No, not really, these are just MY personal picks, and I'm just trying to even it out because I don't like odd numbers.  All of these companies could fail in the future and I'd sell at a loss and put it into SPY like the rest of us.  But one of the best pieces of advice I ever heard was \"invest in things you understand\", and all of these are industries I've either worked in or am very familiar with.  I'm not investing expert.  \n\nThat said, I want my next pick to be something a bit more old money conservative, so I've been considering some more unorthodox options - like SPGI or CME.  Something that tracks the market (or literally OWNS the tracker, in these cases).  BRK.B also seems like a strong choice.  \n\nAny opinions?",

    "selftext": "After losing money in the past 1 year or so, I decided to turn my attention towards the value investing, aka Warren Buffett and Benjamin Graham preaches. Essentially, my portfolio had many risky stocks from EV to Tech. Despite losing \\~50% of such stocks, I feel that I should sell them and load up on value stocks.\n\nI feel some of us are definitely in the same boat. So I want to ask what you think of this. I hope the mods see that this is not \"looking for advice about my personal situation\" since it's probably in many peoples mind. Love to hear your opinions.\n\nI search the web for Graham's value analysis. I probably should read the book but I just check out some articles that do deep dive into this. I found this article is well-written about value investment:  [https://marketinference.com/analysis/r/2022/10/22/msft/](https://marketinference.com/analysis/r/2022/10/22/msft/)\n\nMSFT is an interesting ticker since it's a tech but old. imho, It will survive any market condition and come out as the solid choice. But what confusing to a small investor like me is that... isn't that what EVERYONE knows? Does actually crunching the number (or reading the analysis from the above website) make that much difference?",
