    "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nFirst time with a DD so forgive me if I sound regarded. \n\nThis is the biggest trade I am set up for and wanted to share my thoughts. \n\nI believe we are going to see a huge run up next Tuesday with Microns earnings call. Current price is $162 with the pull back with Samsungs announcement spooking the market but I believe this won\u2019t affect Microns future capabilities with HBM.  \n\nSo Micron Q4 earnings are coming up\u2026 and I\u2019m bullish. I took up a huge position with the underlying prior to the pump on Thursday. \n\nYesterday with the drop I loaded up at the bottom on 200 calls $175 expiring October 17. \n\nMy logic is this. \n\nSeeing what happened with Oracle over their guidance gives me confident we may expect something crazy from Micron, especially when their customers Nvidia, Amd, Microsoft, Amazon, Google all had record years. All of them just crushed it on AI and cloud growth.\n\nIf they\u2019re winning, Micron is too. Every GPU and every data center relies on Micron\u2019s memory to run. While there are 2 main competitors in the memory landscape (Samsung and SK Hynix) I believe Micron is well positioned regardless. \n\nLast quarter: $9.3B in revenue with nearly 50% growth in high-bandwidth memory sales.\n\nNext up: Management is guiding ~$10.7B for Q4 with stronger margins. I think they may beat expectations. \n\nIn all of the last 5 reported fiscal quarters listed above, Micron has beaten EPS expectations.  \ufffc\n\nThe beat amounts range from ~+$0.13 to ~+$0.34 in recent quarters.\n\nThe most recent (Q3 FY2025) was the largest beat in that sample, +$0.34\n\nHowever with this upcoming Q4 FY 2025, EPS consensus estimates are around $2.78-$2.86 per share. Year-over-year that\u2019s a big jump from ~$1.18 in Q4 FY2024.  \ufffc\n\t\nGross margin expectations have been revised up, reflecting tight supply + improved pricing (especially DRAM).\n\nAnalyst Quotes & Price Targets\n\nWedbush (Matt Bryson) \u2013 PT $200\n\n\u201cWedbush analyst Matt Bryson raised the firm\u2019s price target on Micron Technology to $200 from $165 and kept an Outperform rating on the shares. The firm notes that demand from cloud service providers has come in stronger than expected, which could significantly boost Micron\u2019s future sales and pricing power. Wedbush believes that the ongoing AI build-out is creating a structural uplift in demand for DRAM and high-bandwidth memory that will continue through 2026.\u201d \u3010Barron\u2019s\u3011\n\nBarclays \u2013 PT $175\n\n\u201cBarclays analysts raised their Micron target price to $175 from about $140, while maintaining an Overweight rating. The analysts acknowledged that some of the recent NAND chip orders coming out of Silicon Valley may be short-term in nature, but they believe Micron will likely exceed its current guidance. They also expect the company to offer a strong forward outlook as hyperscaler spending on AI infrastructure continues at an aggressive pace.\u201d \u3010Barron\u2019s\u3011\n\nDeutsche Bank (Melissa Weathers) \u2013 PT $175\n\n\u201cDeutsche Bank analyst Melissa Weathers lifted her price target on Micron shares from $155 to $175, reiterating a Buy rating. She noted that favorable market conditions for DRAM and high-bandwidth memory, particularly products tied to artificial intelligence data centers, are a major driver of upside. Weathers added that DRAM pricing has remained firm, supply is constrained, and demand for HBM in GPUs and servers is accelerating faster than the Street had anticipated.\u201d \u3010Investors.com\u3011\n\nMizuho (Vijay Rakesh) \u2013 PT $182\n\n\u201cMizuho Securities raised its price target on Micron to $182 and kept a Buy rating. Analyst Vijay Rakesh wrote that momentum around artificial intelligence and strong demand for high-bandwidth memory should continue to drive Micron\u2019s results higher. He cited tight supply in both DRAM and NAND, with pricing moving upward, as well as Micron\u2019s increasing share of AI-focused products. Rakesh emphasized that Micron is one of the few companies positioned to deliver both volume growth and margin expansion in this environment.\u201d \u3010MarketWatch\u3011\n\nUBS (Timothy Arcuri) \u2013 PT $185\n\n\u201cUBS analyst Timothy Arcuri raised Micron\u2019s price target to $185 and reiterated a Buy rating. Arcuri pointed to confidence in DRAM and HBM supply tightness and sustained AI-related growth as the core reasons for the higher target. He noted that Micron\u2019s technology roadmap has been executing well and that the company is positioned to capture outsized share of the high-performance memory demand wave driven by Nvidia, AMD, and hyperscalers.\u201d \u3010PriceTargets.com\u3011\n\nSusquehanna \u2013 PT $200\n\n\u201cSusquehanna Financial upgraded its Micron target to $200, keeping a Positive rating. Analysts cited tightening DRAM and NAND supply, improving average selling prices across memory, and accelerating AI adoption as reasons to expect Micron\u2019s earnings power to surprise to the upside. The firm believes current Street estimates remain too low given the structural tailwinds in AI-centric workloads.\u201d \u3010PriceTargets.com\u3011\n\nJPMorgan (Harlan Sur) \u2013 PT $185\n\n\u201cJPMorgan analyst Harlan Sur raised Micron\u2019s price target to $185 from $160 and kept an Overweight rating. Sur highlighted upside to revenue, gross margin, and earnings in the near term, driven by better-than-expected pricing across multiple end-markets including AI data centers, smartphones, and personal computers. He said the company is likely to announce November-quarter guidance that comes in solidly ahead of consensus expectations. JPMorgan believes Micron\u2019s HBM3E ramp and DRAM cost reductions are ahead of schedule, which will further support earnings acceleration.\u201d \u3010Benzinga\u3011\n\nRosenblatt Securities (Kevin Cassidy) \u2013 PT $200\n\n\u201cRosenblatt Securities analyst Kevin Cassidy reaffirmed a Buy rating on Micron and boosted the firm\u2019s target to $200. Cassidy wrote that Micron could report a modest beat to its preannounced results, but the real story will be the outlook. He expects Micron\u2019s November-quarter guidance may come in much higher than consensus estimates of $11.8 billion in revenue and non-GAAP EPS of $3.00. Cassidy emphasized that constrained DRAM and NAND Flash wafer supply through at least 2026, alongside accelerating demand from AI workloads, positions Micron for outsized profitability.\u201d \u3010Benzinga\u3011\n\nZacks Investment Research \u2013 Avg PT $155.59 (Range $75\u2013$200)\n\n\u201cZacks recently upgraded Micron from Hold to Strong Buy, giving the stock a Zacks Rank #1. Their analysts cite accelerating demand for DRAM and NAND, stronger-than-expected revenue in AI/data center markets, and consistent earnings surprises as the drivers. Zacks\u2019 consensus 12-month price target from ~34 analysts is $155.59, with estimates ranging from as low as $75 to as high as $200. They highlight Micron\u2019s strong Growth and Momentum scores, though its Value score is weaker given the higher multiples.\u201d \u3010Zacks / MarketBeat\u3011\n\nMicron Management Quotes & Context\n\n\u201cMicron\u2019s strong competitive position and solid execution delivered record revenue in fiscal Q3, with revenue, gross margin and EPS all exceeding the high end of our guidance ranges.\u201d \u2014 Sanjay Mehrotra, CEO.  \ufffc\n\n\u201cData center revenue more than doubled year over year and reached a record level, and consumer-oriented markets had strong sequential growth.\u201d \u2014 Mehrotra.  \ufffc\n\t\n\u201cWe generated substantial free cash flow in the quarter, even as we continue to make strategic investments critical to sustain long term growth.\u201d \u2014 Mehrotra.  \ufffc\n\t\n\u201cMicron delivered record revenue in fiscal Q3, driven by all-time-high DRAM revenue including nearly 50% sequential growth in HBM revenue.\u201d \u2014 Mehrotra.  \ufffc\n\n\u201cWe are on track to deliver record revenue with solid profitability and free cash flow in fiscal 2025, while we invest to build on our leadership to address growing AI-driven memory demand.\u201d \u2014 Mehrotra.  \ufffc\n\n\u201cFiscal Q3 DRAM revenue was $7.1 billion, up 51% year over year, and represented 76% of total revenue. Sequentially, DRAM revenue increased 15%, with bit shipments increasing over 20% and prices decreasing in the low single-digit percentage range, primarily due to a higher consumer-oriented revenue mix.\u201d \u2014 Mark Murphy, CFO.  \ufffc\n\n\u201cNAND revenue was $2.2 billion \u2026 Sequentially, NAND revenue increased 16%, with bit shipments increasing in the mid-20s percentage range and prices decreasing in the high single-digit percentage range.\u201d \u2014 Murphy.  \ufffc\n\n\u201cGross margin \u2026 was above the high end of our guidance range, primarily due to better prices for both DRAM and NAND, partially offset by a higher consumer-oriented mix.\u201d \u2014 CFO Murphy.  \ufffc\n\t\n\u201cEnding inventory for fiscal Q3 was $8.7 billion, or 139 days. Inventory was down $280 million sequentially, and inventory days were down 19 days sequentially, driven by strong sequential bit shipment growth in both DRAM and NAND.\u201d \u2014 Murphy.  \ufffc\n\t\nGuidance for Q4:\n\u201cWe expect revenue of $10.7 billion \u00b1 $300 million; gross margin non-GAAP of ~42% \u00b1 1%; operating expenses approx $1.2 billion \u00b1 $20 million; non-GAAP EPS of ~$2.50 \u00b1 $0.15 per share.\u201d \u2014 Micron management.  \ufffc\n\n\u201cWith another quarter of shipment growth forecasted in fiscal Q4, we expect to exit fiscal 2025 with tight DRAM inventories, significantly reduced NAND inventories and overall company DIO near our target levels. With low inventories on hand and a constructive demand environment, we will continue to focus on improving pricing and further strengthening our product mix.\u201d \u2014 Management.  \ufffc\n\nSource: https://www.insidermonkey.com/blog/micron-technology-inc-nasdaqmu-q3-2025-earnings-call-transcript-1559366/ \n\nTLDR\n\nBest Case (Bullish)\n\nRevenue: ~$11.2B+ (above top of guidance)\n\nEPS: $2.90+ (beats revised $2.85 guide)\n\nGross Margin: 45%+ (tight supply + strong DRAM/HBM pricing)\n\nGuidance: Raised again for FY2026, pointing to sustained AI/cloud demand\n\t\nStock Impact: Could rally +20\u201330%, pushing toward $180\u2013$200 as analysts hike targets\n\nWorst Case (Bearish)\n\nRevenue: < $11.0B (below guide midpoint)\n\nEPS: < $2.70 (miss vs Street ~$2.78\u2013$2.85)\n\nMargins: Slip toward 42\u201343% (pricing softness, higher costs)\n\nGuidance: Conservative, signaling slower demand or inventory concerns\n\nStock Impact: Could drop \u221210\u201325%, retracing toward $120\u2013$130\n\nThe biggest risk I see is the cyclical narrative but given the demand this year and how we are seeing AI and data centers scaling up, I think we have reached a point where the market transitions from cyclical to more secular. \n\nRight now PE is ~24-25 with the drop but if EPS expectation is hit $10-12 for FY 2026, and PE drops to 18-20 we are still looking at $200+ price target. I believe $175-185 is a lower range.\n\nOf course this all depends on how Micron Management forward guidance looks but I think we are in for a surprise. \n\nGood luck \ud83d\ude4f",

    "selftext": "**Short background on my investing journey**\n\nStarted investing June 2020 with \u00a315k. Through pure dumb luck I\u2019ve turned it into \u00a3500k. Started off just copy trading anything that was pumping on here. First big score was $NIO at $11, sold at $50. Then followed a popular poster in here at the time, SirJackalot into a certain banned meme stock and came out with \u00a3300k.\n\nThought I was a genius, made life changing money doing all the wrong things, so I proceeded to nearly throw it all away losing money on every garbage piece of shit you guys shilled me. Wish, Baba, RKT, Palantir (yeah I even managed to lose on PLTR), CLF, every weed stock, you name it, I bag held it.\n\nWent all in AMD (Hence the name) for 2 years of sideways pain, finally sold with a tiny gain. Which leads me to my current play HUT 8. Loaded up when market cap dropped below their BTC holdings after a short report in early 2024.\n\n**HUT 8**\n\n**AI/HPC Pivot**\n\nBitcoin mining is a dying business. Due to the halving, profits are halved every 4 years. Many bitcoin miners are pivoting to hosting AI HPC data centres, which provide more reliable sources of revenue. Even miners like Cleanspark who marketed themselves as 'The last pure play bitcoin miner' are discussing pivoting. These miners have been quietly scooping up cheap power for years and I believe this is not fully priced in and there is a lot of money to be made.\n\nHUT 8 recently announced plans to develop four new sites across the US. Including a 1000MW data centre in Texas and a 300 MW called RiverBend in Louisiana which will be upgrading to 1000MW. Stage 1 for the Riverbend site is expected to be completed by Q4 2025. Therefore I believe an announcement for a deal with a hyper scaler is imminent.\n\nHUT has a huge power pipeline of 10,800MW with 3100 MW capacity under exclusivity and 7700 Capacity under diligence.\n\n**Bitcoin mining carveout (Creation of American Bitcoin)**\n\nHUT 8 has gone into partnership with the Trump brothers Eric and Don Jr to create American Bitcoin ($ABTC). HUT 8 gave away all of their miners for an 80% stake in the company. HUT 8 has pretty much given away 20% of its miners for the Trump brand. Why would they do this? Like it or not the Trump name carries premium. The most expensive stock on the market is $DJT. $DJT is sitting at a $5B market cap despite only doing $1.3m in revenue so far this year. This is by far the most overvalued company on the stock market IMO. ABTC did a private raise worth $220m bringing in the Winklevoss twins which diluted HUT 8's share from 80% to 64% which puts the value at the time of the private raise just north of $1B. They then used the cash raised to upgrade their EH/s from 10 to 24.2.\n\nABTC has currently been public 2 weeks and as I currently sit here $ABTC is currently trading at $7.82 which puts the market cap at $7.1B and values HUT 8's 64% share at $4.5B despite HUT 8's Market cap being $4B itself while also holding 10k Bitcoin worth $1.2B on the balance sheet. ABTC is set up to be self funded and will be able to raise cash at absurd levels compared to what HUT 8 previously could without the Trump brothers while not diluting HUT 8 shares. I love this because I am extremely bullish on the AI HPC/ Energy Infrastructure side of the business and I don't want to be diluted to fund EH/s growth or the straight purchase of Bitcoin.",

Once school ended in June and I had free time, so I sold the leaps, and this is where the real gambling journey began.\n\n\n\nMy first trades were just random weeklies, for example on the first Monday of July I bought TSLA puts when the line went up and calls when the line went down like a monkey. Believe it or not this was only the beginning of the retardedness.\n\n\n\nI read about Donald Jr.\u2019s new SPAC in the daily thread so I decided to invest into CLBR / PEW calls, and was up bigly going into the merger. Then, when the merger actually happened and I got absolutely demolished. This Donald guy had successfully grifted me.\n\n\n\nI got mad at the market so I full ported into OPEN since y\u2019all seemed to believe in it, however this time I actually made money. I\u2019m not sure what the fuck I was doing but I bought both calls and puts, sold the calls at the top and then sold the puts after it got rugged in the middle of the day and made back the money I lost.\u00a0\n\n\n\nThe week after that I was feeling lucky I guess and went back to buying random shit (technically I never stopped doing it, there are like 200 other trades that I didn't bother mentioning, but this time specifically was just extra retarded). I don\u2019t even remember why I got 10k worth of AMD calls but apparently I did, and there\u2019s this one day where I was using half my port on SPY 0DTEs for some reason.  \n\n\n\nAt this point near the end of July I realized that I was being little bit too autistic, so in order to try to be slightly less autistic I went over to check out the value investing sub to and holy shit they\u2019re even more autistic so I gave up and came back to wsb immediately. Saw some guy say that the Google antitrust remedies were coming out soon so I proceeded to full port GOOG calls a few times which yielded the biggest juiciest gains yet and boom now I\u2019m somehow at 50k.\n\n\n\nI just started university this year and nearly had to bag fries every summer to pay my tuition due to the fact that I am poor af, but this gain covers my entire degree, so I am genuinely thankful to this community, because without you guys I would not have found out about options.

    "selftext": "TLDR: AMD finally caught up to NVDA, the market doesn\u2019t realize, go giga long $AMD. \n\nBuy $TLT just incase market crashes so you don\u2019t blow your account up in a black swan, or if thesis is wrong. \n\n\nTrade Setup:\n\t\u2022\t33% Portfolio: AMD calls 12/17/27, $360 strike (111% out of the money as of today)\n\t\u2022\t66% Portfolio: $TLT shares (U.S. Treasury bonds)\n\n$AMD Thesis In A Nutshell:\n\n$NVDA market cap: $4.4T\n$AMD market cap: $270B\n\nThe world is in a massive race to get more chips, and NVDA looks on track for a $10T market cap.\n\nFor the first time starting this quarter, AMD\u2019s MI355X is on par with NVDA, with cheaper chips. Sam Altman promoted the MI400 and MI450 at an AI event earlier this year. Hyperscaler consensus is that they are testing the MI350 this year to get familiar with integrating AMD into their data centers, so they will be ready to place big orders next year for the rack scale MI400 and MI450. This was noted on the most recent earnings call.\n\nFrom here on, AMD\u2019s chips will be on par, if not better, than NVDA for inference, which both Jensen Huang and Sam Altman agree will grow 1000x+ from current demand levels. Jensen said this on the GP2 podcast interview.\n\nIn 2024, AMD did $12B in data center revenue with inferior chips, while NVDA did $115B. If AMD can do $55B in 2027, which is half of NVDA\u2019s 2024 data center revenue, it is easily a $1T company, or an $800 stock.\n\nEverything suggests AMD will have a competitive product at a competitive price point, with demand setting up to be off the charts in 2026 and 2027, similar to NVDA\u2019s neck breaking 2023 and 2024 growth rates of 100%+.\n\nSecond Leg Of Trade:\n\nIf there is a recession or a black swan event, the Fed will cut rates and send TLT soaring, making up for a $0 AMD option. This is a simple hedge against a Covid style scenario.\n\nBest Case:\n\t\u2022\tTLT gains 50% to 100% from rate cuts on 66% of my portfolio\n\t\u2022\tAMD 4x in 2.5 years from AI chip demand, with calls returning 20x on 33% of my portfolio\n\nBase Case:\n\t\u2022\tAMD calls go to $0 if NVDA outcompetes AMD like in past AI failures such as MI300\n\t\u2022\tTLT rises as rates come down, which recovers the call premiums and results in break even in about 2.5 years\n\nWorst Case:\n\t\u2022\tAMD calls go to $0\n\t\u2022\tTLT drops because inflation spikes, resulting in a 30% loss there as well. This is unlikely in my opinion but possible.\n\nMI350X and MI355X should already drive healthy growth for AMD. However, MI400 will be the real game changer because of its scalability. AMD already raised the price for MI350, which just went into production, to $25,000 per chip. MI400 will be a true rack scale solution, making it highly competitive for large cluster projects.\n\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/amd-hikes-mi350-ai-gpu-205052675.html",

I pulled myself and my life together, made some tendies on moves like TMC and PTIR, grew my portfolio to almost 200k.

Anyways I was wrong, not options but I'll be back down 20k again tomorrow if this shit stock keeps tanking.

    "selftext": "Why aren't you buying more?\n\nWhile you regards are circle jerking over NVIDIA's $4T market cap, Jensen is furiously dumping shares to add to his personal jacket collection. Meanwhile, Intel is playing the long game.\n\nNVIDIA's GPU dominance is built on training hype and datacenter porn, but they're about to get steamrolled by the most predictable trend in computing history: eventually, everything runs on a fucking potato.\n\nHere's what's really happening, GPUs weren't designed for AI, AI was designed around GPUs. We're literally running neural networks on graphics cards because that's what was available, not because it's optimal. Now that specialized training and inference hardware is coming, this whole house of cards falls apart.\n\nNot every company is training GPT-5. Only for the top players does this even make sense. The real money isn't in the repurposed graphics cards powering today's model training. It's in the purpose-built, boring-ass processors that'll run AI inference on every toaster, doorbell, and sex toy in existence. And Intel is positioning to own that world.\n\n# Dismantling NVIDIA's hype\n\nLet me break this down for you mouth-breathers. Most of you have no idea what CUDA actually is or why it doesn't matter. The funny thing is neither do the companies or their developers building these AI models using it.\n\nI'm a Platform Engineer. Which means I'm the poor bastard who has to productionize and scale the garbage that AI teams try to ship. Let me tell you, most AI \"engineers\" code like toddlers with crayons. It's embarrassing.\n\nPicture this, you've got these script kiddies sitting in their Herman Miller chairs, MacBook Pros gleaming under the open office lighting, staring lovingly at their golden NVIDIA GPUs like they're some sort of religious artifacts. Like you, to these ape-like engineers, CUDA is simply magic. A godlike ethereal force aligning all the fairy dust just right in their $40,000 golden shrine to Jensen.\n\nBut it isn't.\n\nCUDA is just a C++ extension with some runtime libraries. That's it. The \"moat\" everyone keeps parroting about doesn't exist because ALL the software frameworks used in the industry support multiple backends. PyTorch, TensorFlow, JAX, they all run on AMD, Intel, custom silicon, whatever. The hardware is completely abstracted away. Most developers never even know what backend they're running on.\n\nThese people have zero concept of basic software engineering principles, let alone understanding the backend infrastructure their code runs on. They're statisticians and researchers who learned to use a computer the same way a medieval alchemist learned to use fire.\n\nThey believe that if it runs on their MacBook, it's production ready. They write code like they're still submitting homework assignments, except now their homework is burning through millions in compute costs.\n\n# A Fundamental Shift is Coming\n\nAt the moment, companies everywhere are conflating training requirements with inference requirements like they're the same thing.\n\nI've seen production deployments at major companies that would make any competent engineer weep. Burning millions per year on H100s because they can't differentiate between development and production requirements. Companies treating every ML workload like they're training GPT-5.\n\nThese deployments only exist because companies throw unlimited capex budgets at fundamentally misunderstood architectures just to get a ticket on the AI hype train. But it's not sustainable.\n\nTraining requires massive parallel compute for backpropagation. Fine, NVIDIA won that round with their Ferrari hardware. But the market is shifting from training to inference, and inference has completely different optimization requirements.\n\nInference is single forward passes that need to be cheap, consistent, and efficient, not just fast. A Llama model classifying support tickets doesn't need a $25,000 H100. It needs cost-effective compute that can handle steady loads without breaking the bank. These workloads are perfectly suited for whoever can deliver the best price to performance story. Literally anyone else but NVIDIA.\n\nYou can only burn through VC money and corporate budgets for so long before someone starts asking uncomfortable questions. The corporate bean counters are getting nosy about what these \"AI initiatives\" are actually producing for their massive compute spend. When finance realizes they're paying Ferrari prices for Honda Civic workloads, the free money party ends fast. And where does it go? To Intel, AMD, and every custom silicon vendor with a better price-to-performance story.\n\nRemember DeepSeek? When they claimed comparable performance using 2,048 H800s versus competitors' 10,000+ H100s, NVIDIA lost $589 billion in market value in one day. That wasn't market overreaction. That was the market briefly glimpsing reality about AI efficiency.\n\nIf that's the market reaction to a boost in training efficiency, imagine what happens when the inference efficiency story becomes undeniable.\n\nSpecialized inference chips are already showing 5-20x performance improvements over general-purpose GPUs. When companies realize they can run their workloads on cheaper, more efficient hardware, the migration will be swift and brutal for NVIDIA's margins.\n\nIntel's Gaudi 3 baseboards are delivering 2.9x better price performance to NVIDIA's H100 baseboards.\n\nMeanwhile, Intel trades like a dying company when they're positioned to capture the massive inference market that everyone's ignoring. The technical setup screams bottom, the valuation is absurd, and the fundamental shift is accelerating.\n\n# The Trade:\n\nPositions:\n\nINTC 2600 shares, selling covered calls every other week, selling puts with available cash as collateral.\n\nThe way I see it, you're getting paid to wait on a potential 2-3x if the turnaround works. And if it doesn't, you're buying below tangible book value while NVIDIA holders watch their gains evaporate.\n\nINB4 \"why aren't you buying puts on NVIDIA?\":\n\nListen, that stock has more momentum than a freight train on cocaine. Maybe it keeps ripping to $300 while I'm crying into my positions. But physics applies to stonks too, and what goes parabolic eventually comes back to earth.\n\nI'd rather bet on the inevitable winner of the post-hype reality than try to time the peak of an irrational bubble.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xmglkhvmx4df1.jpg?width=1440&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d939203b7b9572772c62f82e3e5f86d1e34d98ef\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5ngq2jvmx4df1.jpg?width=1440&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a826c74967aec01345920301b33205da47085b31\n\n",

The next closest gain for an S&P 500 company in that time period is a 540% pop for Vistra Corp ([VST](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/VST)).Nvidia has established itself as the key provider of chips needed to operate AI systems. Now at the epicenter of an AI arms race, Nvidia has established itself as[\u00a0a cornerstone of the recent bull market](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/live/stock-market-today-tech-leads-stocks-higher-as-nvidia-surges-to-record-high-175727614.html)\u00a0in stocks as the company's sales and profits have skyrocketed over the past several years.\n\nAhead of the\u00a0[company's next quarterly earnings release on May 28](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-to-report-q1-earnings-as-middle-east-deals-export-control-reprieve-boost-stock-122728218.html), we broke down some of the most eye-popping charts that show how Nvidia became one of the most-followed stocks in the market.There's perhaps no clearer way to see how Nvidia ran away from the competition in the AI boom than looking at the company's market capitalization against its peers. Back when ChatGPT launched, Nvidia had a market cap of just over $400 billion. It's now over $3.3 trillion. Over that same time period, chip competitor Intel's ([INTC](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/INTC)) market cap has actually decreased, while Advanced Micro Devices' ([AMD](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMD)) market cap has increased incrementally from $125 billion to $177 billion.Nvidia's rise proved to be at the center of a new technological boom. Combined with Nvidia, the rise in dominance of six other companies \u2014 Apple ([AAPL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL)), Alphabet ([GOOGL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOGL),\u00a0[GOOG](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOG)), Microsoft ([MSFT](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MSFT)), Amazon ([AMZN](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMZN)), Meta ([META](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/META)), and Tesla ([TSLA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA)) \u2014 formed what would come to be known as the\u00a0[\"Magnificent Seven.\"](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/one-chart-shows-how-the-magnificent-7-have-dominated-the-stock-market-in-2023-203250125.html)\n\nThe group began the AI boom with a combined market cap just shy of $7 billion. Now, two and a half years later, the Big Tech group's market cap is worth over $16.8 trillion. The seven companies have grown from about 22% of the S&P 500's market cap in November 2022 to 32% of the index's market cap today.Given the outsized weighting in the S&P 500, large swings in shares of Nvidia have become a feature of how even broad market investors are thinking about the direction of stocks. In June 2024,[\u00a0three Wall Street strategists boosted their year-end S&P 500 targets](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ai-enthusiasm-prompts-3-wall-street-banks-to-raise-stock-market-forecasts-100027154.html), citing better-than-expected consistent performance among key AI players.\n\nAs of May 19, the Magnificent Seven have accounted for about 52% of the S&P 500's gain since Nov. 30, 2022. Nvidia alone has contributed 17.21%, by far the most among the group, with the next closest stock, Microsoft, which has added about 8.8%.Nvidia's stock hasn't been rising from just hype. The company's quarterly financial metrics have soared. In the quarter ChatGPT launched, Nvidia posted revenue of $6.3 billion. Two years later, it would post revenue of $35.3 billion. That's a 460% increase in sales in two years. As seen in the chart below, the main source of growth for Nvidia has been its data center revenue segment, which includes the sales of its AI chips.\n\nFrom the company's fourth quarter of 2023 to its final quarter of its 2025 reporting period, data center revenue grew almost 900%.\n\nNvidia's data center revenue particularly stands out when considering its rise against peers in the industry. In the final quarter of 2024, Nvidia notched a record $35.58 billion in just data center revenue, up from $3.62 billion in the final quarter of 2022.\n\nIn comparison, Alphabet's data center revenue increased to $11.96 billion, ending 2024 up from $7.32 billion in the final quarter of 2022.\n\n\n\n",

    "title": "What a UAE Deal Might Mean For SMCI",
    "selftext": "This has been a pretty eventful week for SMCI and the AI sector as a whole. the acquisition of a [$20 billion deal](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/saudis-datavolt-signs-20bn-deal-with-supermicro/) with DataVolt in Saudi Arabia and a 39% jump in share price off the strength of the news and overall AI sentiment improving is enough to make any degen hard as solid veiny diamonds. One thing this week that has especially caught my eye is UAE's plan to construct a [5GW AI Campus](https://www.commerce.gov/news/press-releases/2025/05/uae-and-us-presidents-attend-unveiling-phase-1-new-5gw-ai-campus-abu), with the help of G42, that will house 5GW worth of data center racks and span **10 square miles**.\n\nTo put this into perspective, thats:\n\n* 50k 100kW full-scale liquid-cooled racks\n* 3.2 **million** Nvidia Blackwell (B100) chips\n* More power than NYC and San Francisco **combined**\n* Equivalent to powering **3-4 million** homes or running **50 million** gaming PCs at full power 24/7\n\nAs you can see, this is an insanely ambitious feat the UAE is trying to achieve. Nonetheless, I couldn't help but ask myself, of the roughly 50k racks the UAE plans to procure, how many of those racks will be SMCI? Furthermore, whatever amount of racks SMCI does provide, how much money does SMCI stand to make from the project? Most importantly, What does that mean for the share price?\n\nFirst, we need to understand what DCBBS is, and how it actually benefits customers with large scale projects like the UAE AI Campus.\n\nDCBBS stands for **Direct Connect Backplane Building Block Solutions**, and it\u2019s SMCI's proprietary system architecture for building **full AI racks,** not just individual servers. This means when a customer selects which AI rack configuration they want, when it arrives at their door, it comes in a form [like this](https://trendspider.com/blog/dell-and-super-micro-power-musks-ai-ambitions/). In other words, customers are getting Kitchen-Aid refrigerators sent to their fucking door that contain 30-90 Nvidia Blackwell chips and liquid cooling systems within them. No more receiving your SMCI rack order in individual server pieces that you have to assemble on your own. This greatly increases the speed in which these new data centers can go live. In most cases, these racks can be installed and plugged in in **under a day.**\n\nAdditionally, this also helps to increase their margins over time.\n\nTraditionally, SMCI sold servers as modular building blocks. things like:\n\n* 1U and 2U server chassis\n* Motherboards\n* Power supplies\n* GPU trays\n\nCustomers (like system integrators, VARs, or hyperscalers) would assemble these into racks themselves. That\u2019s low-margin business, because you\u2019re selling parts, not solutions. the DCBBS racks contain:\n\n* CPU & GPU servers (e.g., Nvidia Blackwell, AMD EPYC, Intel Gaudi)\n* Total liquid cooling (cold plates, manifolds, chillers, etc.)\n* Network switches\n* Rack management software\n* Power distribution units (PDUs)\n\nWhy does this new model increase margins? Because it is a shift SMCI is making, from selling modular pieces that must be assembled, to selling complete solutions that are pre-assembled and ready for use upon arrival. This gives SMCI increased pricing power and in turn, increased margins. Below is a comparison table to illustrate the logic:\n\n|Old Model (Per Server)|Rack-Scale Model (Per Rack)|\n|:-|:-|\n|Sell parts separately|Sell the full system integration|\n|$5K\u2013$15K ASP/server|$250K\u2013$2M ASP per rack|\n|6\u201310% gross margin|**15\u201325%+ gross margin**|\n|Low-value add|**Turnkey AI solution** = premium pricing|\n\nNow lets go more in depth:\n\n**1. Higher Average Selling Price (ASP) per Unit**\n\n* Traditional air-cooled servers sell for **$10K\u2013$50K** each.\n* Liquid-cooled **DCBBS racks** (often 64\u201396 GPUs) sell for **$2\u20135 million per rack**.\n* Even if gross margins stay in the 8\u201310% range, **gross profit per rack is 40\u00d7\u201380\u00d7 higher** than per-server sales.\n\nHigher ASP = greater dollar-margin per unit sold, allowing SMCI to increase overall margins even with a similar percentage.\n\n**2. Bundled Value = Control Over Margin Levers**\n\nWith DCBBS, SMCI is not just selling a server, it\u2019s delivering:\n\n* 8\u201312 liquid-cooled GPU servers\n* 2000+ liquid-cooled racks a month\n* Integrated CDUs (coolant distribution units)\n* Power delivery + networking\n* Cabling, plumbing, and chassis integration\n* Software/BIOS optimization\n\nAll of these are designed, manufactured, and **assembled in-house**, which means:\n\n1. Vertical integration reduces dependency on low-margin commodity components\n2. Custom bundles let SMCI charge more for value-added services\n3. Standardization improves yield, reduces warranty risk, and shortens labor cycles\n\n**3. Faster Time-to-Deployment = Premium Pricing Power**\n\nSMCI can ship **fully integrated, plug-and-play racks in 3\u20134 weeks**, while others take 8\u201312 weeks+ with multiple vendors.\n\nFor hyperscalers and AI startups racing to bring GPU clusters online, this **speed translates into willingness to pay more**, or at least not negotiate down.\n\nFor example: A customer buying a $2.5M rack from SMCI may avoid:\n\n* Extra $500k/month in AI cloud rental costs\n* 3\u20134 month delay in deploying AI training models\n* Facility delays in retrofitting for traditional HVAC-based servers\n\nBelow is a table below comparing liquid-cooled racks Time-to-Deployment between SMCI and its competitors:\n\n|**Vendor**|**Liquid-Cooled Rack Output (Est.)**|**Time to Deployment**|**Notes**|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|**SMCI**|**\\~2,000+ racks/month**|**3\u20134 weeks** (from factory)|DCBBS fully integrated, scalable, Blackwell-ready|\n|**Dell**|*Unknown (not disclosed)*|\\~6\u201310 weeks (unverified)|IR7000 liquid-cooled racks for hyperscalers, but no output figures released|\n|**HPE**|*Limited modular deployments*|\\~8\u201312 weeks (pods)|Offers liquid-cooled AI systems (e.g. Cray EX, Apollo), but mostly for supercomputing clients|\n|**Lenovo**|*Unknown*|6+ weeks (via FIS programs)|Neptune liquid cooling, but most integration is not turnkey at SMCI pace|\n\nThis \u201ctime-value\u201d premium enhances margin per contract.\n\n**4. Liquid Cooling = Lower Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) for Clients**\n\nClients benefit from:\n\n* 30\u201350%+ reduction in power usage (no fans/blowers at server level)\n* Higher rack density \u2192 fewer racks \u2192 less real estate\n* Reduced HVAC burden \u2192 capex + opex savings\n\nBecause DCBBS racks are pre-validated and ready for 80\u2013100+ kW loads, customers can safely go denser per rack \u2014 which:\n\n* Makes SMCI\u2019s per-rack offering more economically valuable\n* Lets them preserve pricing vs. air-cooled OEMs like Lenovo, HPE, or Dell, who may cut prices to remain competitive\n\nHigher value-to-customer means more pricing power = higher gross margin\n\n**5. Operational Efficiency at Scale**\n\nSMCI is building out:\n\n* A 3 million square foot manufacturing campus in Silicon Valley and Malaysia\n* A supply chain optimized for GPU pre-allocation, liquid cooling parts, and just-in-time rack assembly\n\nThis allows SMCI to:\n\n* Mass produce racks with minimal retooling\n* Reduce per-rack cost at high volume\n* Use contract-based repeat orders (like the DataVolt $20B deal) to plan capacity\n\nEconomies of scale + predictable assembly processes = declining cost/unit \u2192 rising margin\n\nBelow is a comparison table illustrating the margin impact:\n\n|**Advantage**|**Margin Impact**|\n|:-|:-|\n|High ASP per rack|Higher gross profit in dollar terms|\n|Bundled hardware/services|Increases perceived value + vertical profit|\n|Speed to deploy (3-4 weeks)|Pricing premium vs. slower OEMs|\n|Energy/cooling savings for customer|Improves TCO \u2192 preserves SMCI pricing power|\n|Factory integration at scale|Lowers per-rack cost with volume|\n\nSo far, we've learned how DCBBS can substantially decrease build times for customers and how it could potentially increase margins for SMCI.\n\nNow to the fun part: The UAE Deal\n\nAfter doing some ape fisted carpet eating math, I estimate that the total cost of the 5GW AI Campus would be about $125 billion (assuming **each rack** draws about 100kW and sells for $2.5 million). Based on these numbers, I had ChatGPT build a table with a break down of what SMCI would get based on various percentages of the project they would be responsible for and superimposed a likelihood of occurrence formula in there:\n\n|Coverage %|Likelihood of Occurrence|Racks Provided|G42 Total Payment to SMCI|Estimated Gross Profit (USD) 9.7%|Estimated EBITDA (USD)|Estimated EPS|Implied Share Price (@20x PE)|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|1%|Highly Likely (90%)|500|$1,250,000,000|$121,250,000|$103,062,500|$1.87|$37.40|\n|2%|Very Likely (80%)|1000|$2,500,000,000|$242,500,000|$206,125,000|$3.75|$75.00|\n|5%|Likely (65%)|2500|$6,250,000,000|$606,250,000|$515,312,500|$9.37|$187.40|\n|10%|Possible (45%)|5000|$12,500,000,000|$1,212,500,000|$1,030,625,000|$18.74|$374.80|\n|25%|Plausible (25%)|12500|$31,250,000,000|$3,031,250,000|$2,576,562,500|$46.84|$936.80|\n|50%|Unlikely (10%)|25000|$62,500,000,000|$6,062,500,000|$5,153,125,000|$93.70|$1,874.00|\n|100%|Very Unlikely (3%)|50000|$125,000,000,000|$12,125,000,000|$10,306,250,000|$187.40|$3,748.00|\n\nAs you can see, even with a conservative PE of 20x and 9.7% margins, if SMCI gets even 2-5% of the project, thats an EPS of $3.75-9.37 and a share price of $75-187 a share.\n\n**How ChatGPT Calculated the Likelihoods**\n\nThis wasn\u2019t a statistical model but rather a strategic probability estimate based on 5 weighted factors:\n\n**1. Historical Precedent (30%)**\n\n* No hyperscaler or government has ever given 100% of a 5GW AI deployment to one vendor.\n* Datavolt gave SMCI a $20B deal, but likely part of a larger multi-phase build \u2014 suggesting up to 25% is plausible.\n\n**2. Industry Norm for Diversification (25%)**\n\n* Large clients (e.g. AWS, G42, Meta) **split procurement across 2\u20134 OEMs** for risk mitigation, price leverage, and geopolitical hedging.\n* Most national-scale AI campuses split rack-scale work among **Dell, Lenovo, HPE, SMCI, Nvidia integrators**, etc.\n\n**3. SMCI Production Capacity (20%)**\n\n* SMCI can output \\~5,000 racks/month total, **2,000+ liquid cooled**.\n* To hit 50\u2013100% coverage of a 5GW facility, they\u2019d need to commit 6\u201312 months of global capacity, which limits probability unless it's multi-year.\n\n**4. Geopolitical Alignment (15%)**\n\n* SMCI already has deep regional partnerships (Saudi Arabia, Abu Dhabi), so 10\u201325% is well within reach.\n* But **50\u2013100%** would likely require **exclusive national alignment**, which is rare unless the vendor is sovereign or majority-owned.\n\n**5. First-Mover Advantage & Time-to-Deploy (10%)**\n\n* SMCI\u2019s lead time (3\u20134 weeks vs. 8\u201312 weeks) is a massive advantage.\n* For urgency-sensitive contracts, this could **justify awarding 25% or more** \u2014 but not 100%, barring a disruption in Dell/HPE supply.\n\nI think its also important to add, two job listenings have been posted for positions in Abu Dhabi:\n\n[Account Sales Manager](https://jobs.supermicro.com/job/United-Arab-Emirates-Abu-Dha-Sales-Account-Manager/1148026500/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n\n[Technology Enablement Engineer](https://jobs.supermicro.com/job/United-Arab-Emirates-Abu-Dha-Technology-Enablement-Engineer/1246502400/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n\n\n\nAll in all, SMCI could stand to make a assload of money from a G42 UAE deal.\n\nLast but not least, Cramer is [\u201cSick of\u201d](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/topstocks/jim-cramer-is-sick-of-super-micro-computer-stock-should-you-sell-smci-now/ar-AA1F0NkN?ocid=finance-verthp-feeds) SMCI\n\n  \nTL:DR: SMCI provides the fastest Time-to-Deployment of any of its competitors with its liquid-cooled DCBBS solution and this could help increase margins overtime and make it a more attractive buy to larger customers ready to deploy immediately. Capturing even 5% of the G42 UAE deal could result in a share price of $180+ a share. SMCI is already hiring for positions in Abu Dhabi.\n\nPosition: 15 $91c 1/16\nhttps://ibb.co/b5J9VNmY\n",

    "title": "Everything about AMD's earnings tonight",
    "selftext": "Okay guys, AMD will report its first quarter earnings after the bell on Tuesday. What are we gonna do? See, I'm the concern about the impact of Trump\u2019s tariffs on chip sales and the health of the AI market ahead of Nvidia\u2019s (NVDA) earnings later this month.\n\nFor those who have been paying attention, AMD\u2019s announcement follows rival Intel\u2019s (INTC) report, which saw the company beat on the top and bottom lines but issue lighter-than-anticipated revenue guidance in the second quarter. At the time, Intel CFO David Zinsner blamed the \u201ccurrent macro environment\u201d for creating \u201celevated uncertainty across the industry.\u201d\n\nPC makers produce a number of their products in China, as well as Vietnam and Malaysia. Computers are currently exempt from Trump\u2019s tariffs, but the administration has said it could implement duties on semiconductors based on the results of the Commerce Department\u2019s Section 232 investigation.\n\nFor the quarter, AMD is expected to report adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.94 on revenue of $7.1 billion. The company saw EPS of $0.62 and revenue of $5.4 billion in the same quarter last year. Data Center segment revenue is expected to bring in $3.6 billion in the quarter compared to $2.3 billion last year.\n\nIn April, AMD, like Nvidia, announced that the Trump administration instituted tighter export controls on AI chips destined for China. The move effectively cuts off AMD\u2019s ability to ship its MI308 AI processor to the region, and, according to the company, might result in as much as an $800 million charge on inventory, purchase commitments, and related reserves. And that could weigh on the company\u2019s Q2 outlook.\n\nI expect AMD to post higher results but guide lower given 1Q strength for MI308. Longer term, this might be a good thing in 2Q with the AI chip ban into China.\n\nFor those following AI stocks, you may have noticed them taking a major hit over the past few months on fears that the trade has been overhyped. DeepSeek\u2019s January announcement that it managed to produce high-performance AI models using less than top-of-the-line chips further hammered chip stocks.\n\nShares of AMD are off 18% year to date and 36% over the last 12 months. Nvidia is down 15% year to date, but still up 22% over the last year.\n\nUnfortunately for AMD the AI story (which is already somewhat tenuous) is likely to drop further on the back of new China sanctions. \n\n[Chart](https://i.imgur.com/4PdTT1Q.png)\n\nAI chip companies with to deal with the government's AI diffusion rules, which would require certain countries to acquire special licenses to gain access to a limited number of US AI chips.\n\nAMD\u2019s Client segment, which includes revenue from the sale of laptop and desktop chips, is expected to generate $2 billion in revenue, up from $1.3 billion in Q1 last year. There\u2019s the potential that the company could report that it saw a pull forward in sales leading up to Trump\u2019s April 2 tariff announcements.\n\nFrom what I've read, the core PC business appears to be exposed to channel effects (client shipments last quarter were higher than the peak of the COVID bubble already).\n\nAMD\u2019s gaming business, which includes sales of GPUs and semi-custom chips for video game consoles, is expected to bring in $540 million, a 41% year-over-year decline from the same quarter last year. It's only recently that the Ryzen biz has pivoted from hardcore HPC parts, such as the Instinct MI250-series used in the United States' first exascale supercomputer at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, to parts competitive with Nvidia for lower-precision AI applications. When it launched, the MI300X boasted up to 32 percent higher performance in certain AI workloads compared to Nvidia's then-flagship the H100, along with more than double the memory and significantly greater bandwidth. \n\nSony's (SONY) and Microsoft\u2019s (MSFT) consoles are approaching the second half of their life cycles, which generally means sales slide versus when they initially hit the market. Companies are also raising prices on the systems to contend with tariffs. Sony has increased the price of its PlayStation in Europe, but not in the US. Consoles aren\u2019t exempt from duties like laptops and desktops. As a result, Microsoft announced it is raising the price of its Xbox Series X by $100 to $599. The company also said it\u2019s raising the price of some of its first-party games to $79 from $69.\n\nI usually like to sit out earnings, but am strongly considering puts (a put spread to avoid IV crush).

    "selftext": "Everyone likes to make jokes at the expense of some people who are terrible at trading options here. Telling them, \"See ya at Wendy's!\" (For reasons we all know), but what if, that isn't a bad idea?\n\nWe all have a Wendy's somewhere in our town, and obviously people are still buying burgers, nuggets, the works, as shown in their sales.\n\n[Sales](https://preview.redd.it/8qncms9s4gwe1.png?width=340&format=png&auto=webp&s=b52b2ad8e9483508434f792314cf52046d821f85)\n\nThe share price is at a comfy low P/E of 13, with a lower Forward P/E of 11, which means you're paying close to what the stock is worth as compared to when you look at big tech companies with inflate P/E ratios (Looking at you PLTR and AMD).\n\nWendy's currently pays a quarterly dividend of $0.25 per share, coming to Dividend yield TTM of 8.01%, which beats the yield of many REITs, and not to mention, treasuries (Why buy treasuries when you can buy Wendy's?)\n\nNext on the menu (Get it?) We have Institutional ownership which makes up 88% of the owned shares. Trian Fund Management and Vanguard are big names with a huge stake in this old American company, it's not likely they are going to cut their stake between considering the dividend yield and their own sunk cost into investing in it.\n\n[Ownership](https://preview.redd.it/s3ie22uv4gwe1.png?width=293&format=png&auto=webp&s=ddf01a25de881a2e9b0e679c84ef3610c613d18f)\n\nLastly, the special sauce. I went to the effort of drawing these lines so you don't have to. I expect to see $WEN between $16-$24 per share within the next 3 years, maintaining their current dividend yield as well (I am expecting a 40% ROI + 8%/Year for 48% after 3 years).\n\n[Crayons](https://preview.redd.it/zg15ko965gwe1.png?width=952&format=png&auto=webp&s=a6d7163eef48a4b80773acfdbf1b3de407d5190f)\n\n  \nThat being said, you guys are probably thinking...BORING! Where's the moonshot? Why wait that long? Well, I got an answer for you. I personally believe I am overestimating the time it will take to see these numbers. When enough people catch on that Wendy's is a heck of a value play, it's only going to drive the share price up into a upwards snowball, at least until the yield and P/E isn't tempting enough (Like they're Dave Singles).\n\nAnyways, that is my DD for now on $WEN. Opened a position of 4 $14 Calls for June, and bought 36 shares. Going to invest more as I obtain more capital inflow, targeting making this at least 5% of my portfolio within the next 6 months.\n\n  \nPOSITION SCREENSHOTS:\n\n[Shares](https://preview.redd.it/rbugvgjz4gwe1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bc6f409643194991a2886e46280bca3da0490ae1)\n\n[Options](https://preview.redd.it/6vf3nn815gwe1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=92c9178cddb77640d2523d37d4272991382110b4)\n\n  \n\n\nRegards,\n\nNalon McCallough",

While screening the Swiss Performance Index I found Arzyta, a large bakery. Why I\u2018m bullish on the stock:\n- No operations in the US\n- No sales in the US\n- Sourcing their commodities (wheat) mainly within Europe, Australia, Malaysia -> no tariffs\n- Sales is 89% Europe, 11% RoW\n- they continously improved their balance sheet\n- they bought back a hybrid bond which will reduce their financing costs by approx. EUR 11.5% (this is 8.34% of their free cash flow!)They expect this to fully materialite in 2025 \u2014> the buy back happened in October 2024\n\nThe above are the facts (soure is their 2024 FY report).\n\nNow some additional thoughts:\n- Wheat producers in EU will most likely not sell anymore to the USA which means they will have a over capacity which leads to lower prices. Wheat is perishable that means the cost of purchase will most likely decrease amd hence increase their operational margin\n\n- Given the high tariffs imposed by the US it is likely that the EU and Switzerland will decrease their interest rates which means ARYN could refinance them cheaper\n\n- The market should recognize the company to be a Consumer Staple which would allow higher multiples in terms of valuation\n\n- There are only few analysts covering the stock (all of them have a Buy or Strong Buy rating)\n\nI entered a smaller position in the stock this week. \n\nWhat are your thoughts?

Here's the lowdown:\n\n* **Consumer GPUs**: Think gaming rigs, content creators, and PC enthusiasts.\n* **Data Centers & AI**: Powering massive AI workloads, cloud services, and enterprise data centers.\n* **Self-Driving & Robotics**: Venturing into autonomous vehicles, robotics, and edge computing.\n\n**Financials: Show Me the Money**\n\nLet's dive into NVIDIA's financials over the past five years. Spoiler: It's been a wild ride.\n\n|Fiscal Year|Revenue ($B)|Net Income ($B)|EPS ($)|Gross Margin (%)|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|2021|16.7|4.3|1.47|62|\n|2022|26.9|9.8|3.37|65|\n|2023|27.0|10.2|3.55|66|\n|2024|30.0|11.5|4.00|67|\n|2025\\*|35.0|13.0|4.50|68|\n\n\\*2025 numbers are guesstimates, so don't @ me if they're off.\n\n**Breaking It Down:**\n\n* **Revenue**: Climbing like a SpaceX rocket, thanks to data centers and AI.\n* **Net Income & EPS**: Also on the up and up, showing they're not just making it rain but also stacking those Benjamins efficiently.\n* **Gross Margin**: From 62% to an estimated 68%\u2014that's some serious cheddar, indicating their products are top-shelf.\n\n**Product Highlights: What's Cooking?**\n\n* **Blackwell Ultra Series**: Dropping later this year, these AI chips (B300/GB300) are beefed up with 288GB memory (up from 192GB) and a 50% performance boost. Data centers are drooling.\n* **Full-Stack AI Solutions**: NVIDIA's building an AI empire, making it easier for cloud providers and businesses to hop on their bandwagon and save some coin.\n* **Self-Driving & Robotics**: They're not just about GPUs; they're diving into autonomous vehicles and robots, keeping things futuristic.\n\n**GTC 2025: The Hype Is Real**\n\n* **Event Deets**: On March 18 in San Jose, NVIDIA's annual GTC shindig is the place to be for devs, investors, and media folks. Expect AI, robotics, data centers, and self-driving car talk, plus the scoop on Blackwell Ultra chips and the next-gen Rubin GPU architecture.\n* **Market Vibes**: Tickets are hotter than a summer in Phoenix, but NVDA stock dipped \\~1.76% pre-event. Investors might be biting their nails over production and yield concerns.\n* **Catalyst Watch**: Analysts say if NVIDIA clears the air on production and performance at GTC, we could see a stock rally. If not, expect some market side-eye until the next earnings drop.\n\n**6-Month Stock Forecast: Crystal Ball Time**\n\n* **Bearish Scenario**: If new products flop or GTC is a snooze, stock might chill around $120.\n* **Bullish Scenario**: If GTC delivers and NVIDIA squashes production fears, we could see $150 or more.\n* **Overall Range**: Expect NVDA to dance between $120 and $150 in the next six months.\n\n**Investment Take: To the Moon?**\n\n* **Hold & HODL**: Most analysts are saying \"buy\" or \"hold,\" betting on NVIDIA's long-term game in AI, data centers, and self-driving tech.\n* **DCA FTW**: Given possible short-term jitters post-GTC, consider dollar-cost averaging. Keep an eye on upcoming earnings and product launches.\n\n**Risk Factors: Watch Your Six**\n\n* **Production & Supply Chain**: If the new chips hit snags, short-term profits could take a hit.\n* **Competition**: AMD, Intel, and other up-and-comers aren't sleeping; they want a piece of NVIDIA's pie.\n* **Macro & Geopolitical**: Global economic hiccups, trade wars, or export bans could rain on NVIDIA's parade.\n* **Tech & Product Risks**: If GTC doesn't wow or new products disappoint, investor enthusiasm might fizzle, leading to stock dips.\n\n**TL;DR**\n\nNVIDIA's killing it in the GPU and AI arena, with solid financials and exciting product launches on deck. GTC 2025 is the next big thing to watch. Short-term, the stock might wobble, but long-term prospects look juicy. Keep an eye on competition and global shenanigans, but overall, NVIDIA seems poised for more win.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/74kn7chvdipe1.jpg?width=1600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6a6f2475f9c039d245f60bcd16728bf87362db7d\n\n",

    "selftext": "TLDR; only truly American fab. With AI race at full speed, semiconductor hardware (NOT SOFTWARE) will become the defining strategic resource of the superpowers. \n\n\nPeople will say oh but TSMC is better at production, but NVDA designs better chips, but AMD. We have to take a trip through the history of TSMC and its founder Morris Chang as well as the cold war. \n\nLet's look at Morris. He went to Harvard and MIT and then stayed in the US to work for Texas Instruments for 30 years, obtaining his American citizenship in the process. 30 years is more time than many in this app have lived thus far. I'd say he's an American through and through. He was next in line for the position of CEO at TI, but ultimately because he was of Chinese descent he was turned down for the role. Now, at the age of 55, the Taiwanese government reached out to him to fund a fab company; TSMC is born. \n\nAI will be more important than the space race and the nuclear arms race. The implications are so profound that nations are no longer cooperating to build it together and are strategically trying to limit the advancement of their enemies; e.g. blocking Nividia chip sales to China. The most effective embargo is a hardware embargo. \n\nWith national security at stake, if they didn't trust Morris to run TI, what would make them trust TSMC to be the sole provider of chips to America? And on a side note, with TSMC in Taiwan and the vast majority of chips being produced in a country neighboring China, that risk level is over 9000. China is already designing and producing their own  chips with varying degrees of success. You guys can fill in the blank of what the US government fears the most. It is absolutely crucial to have production back in the US. \n\nThat leaves us with the only option, Intel. It is the only company that has a full white lineage of leadership. Real American Company as some would say. \n\n\n\n\n\nP.S. to the haters when I shorted tesla, I covered for a 3k profit \ud83d\udc3b\ud83e\udee1\n",

    "selftext": "TL;DR: Estimating NVIDIA's Q4 FY2025\\* revenue from the capex of its four largest customers using linear regression results in an estimated revenue that is significantly higher than Wall Street's expectations.\n\n*\\*Note: Although it may sound confusing, NVIDIA is in fiscal year 2025 and will report its* [*Q4 FY2025 results on February 26, 2025*](https://investor.nvidia.com/events-and-presentations/events-and-presentations/default.aspx)*.*\n\n*This is the author\u2019s opinion only, not financial advice, and is intended for entertainment purposes only. The author holds a beneficial long position in NVIDIA Corporation. The author receives no compensation for writing this article and has no business relationship with any of the companies mentioned. The following analysis has been carefully conducted, but numbers or calculations may be incorrect, leading to potentially incorrect results.*\n\nNVIDIA will report its\u00a0Q4 FY2025 financial results on February 26. The consensus estimate for NVIDIA's Q4 revenue is\u00a0[$38.13 billion](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NVDA/analysis/?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAANOTJUpcAKXWdLKLCN4HDOw3xKM2mpDinXbx-3Ru72Xm5RtzQ8Qf0ruVaAPw61jJOwPbZHkqX9X2SRQvZJqafxEFMyTmQoFXdmxWLKJ-26YBEwQoOy5EcgpCEHOlmOzeyyZXGeSD-90RiaVAj_H8nFt0DtbA37mKFQUC-eGlN5tA). In the past two weeks, Microsoft, Meta, Alphabet, and Amazon, NVIDIA's largest customers, have reported earnings.\u00a0[One of the biggest headlines](https://www.ft.com/content/634b7ec5-10c3-44d3-ae49-2a5b9ad566fa)\u00a0was the announcement that these four companies plan to spend approximately $320 billion in capital expenditures (capex) through 2025:\n\n|Year|Meta|Alphabet|Microsoft|Amazon|Sum|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|2024 ($bn)|39.2|52.6|75.6|77.8|245.2|\n|2025 (planned, $bn)|65.0|75.0|80.0|100.0|320.0|\n\nMuch less attention was paid to the significant increase in capital expenditures by these companies last quarter:\n\n|Category|Meta|Alphabet|Microsoft|Amazon|Sum|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Last quarter reported ($bn)|14.425|14.276|15.804|27.834|72.339|\n|Previous quarter ($bn)|8.258|13.061|14.923|22.620|58.862|\n|Change from previous quarter|\\+74.7%|\\+9.3%|\\+5.9%|\\+23.1%|\\+22.90%|\n\nSince these 4 companies are the largest buyers of NVIDIA's GPUs, it makes sense to examine a correlation between these companies' quarterly capex and NVIDIA's quarterly revenue. For the last 7 quarters, we get a strong correlation coefficient of 0.95 (Pearson correlation). Now, if we use linear regression to estimate NVIDIA's revenue for the yet-to-be-reported Q4 2025 based on this data, we get quarterly revenue of $49.265 billion, which is more than $10 billion above the consensus analyst estimate.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fuwtgc4iv9ie1.png?width=2000&format=png&auto=webp&s=477315081203fddfa64c4744f2429c371c4a8041\n\nOf course, NVIDIA's GPUs account for only a portion of these 4 companies' reported capex. However, given the recent disappointing results from NVIDIA's competitor AMD, that portion may have increased. It could also be that a lot of datacenters have been built now and these costs were already incurred in previous quarters, leaving more capex for NVIDIA's GPUs - and the newly built datacenters should now have plenty of room for the upcoming Blackwell generation. Of course, companies like Alphabet are also building their own AI chips, but\u00a0they are much less cost-effective\u00a0than NVIDIA's Hopper generation and especially the upcoming Blackwell generation. Or as\u00a0[Amazon CEO Andy Jassy put it on an analyst call last week](https://www.barrons.com/articles/nvidia-stock-price-87ccceac?mod=RTA): \"*most AI compute has been driven by Nvidia chips, and we obviously have a deep partnership with Nvidia and will for as long as we can see into the future.*\" All in all, one could assume that the share of capex from these 4 companies going to NVIDIA may have even increased in the last quarter.\n\nIn addition, there are other major buyers of NVIDIA's GPUs: xAI, for example, has also purchased tens of thousands of NVIDIA's GPUs and built the massive supercomputer\u00a0[Colossus with 100,000 NVIDIA Hopper GPUs](https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/spectrum-x-ethernet-networking-xai-colossus). Another massive buyer of NVIDIA's GPUs has just formed with Project Stargate, which plans to invest a staggering\u00a0[$500 billion in new AI infrastructure](https://openai.com/index/announcing-the-stargate-project/)\u00a0over the next four years. All of this should continue to be a strong wind in NVIDIA's sails.\n\nMy positions: 200 NVIDIA shares.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j0g34hamv9ie1.jpg?width=1149&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e0f3896af535ba99a9f1c040540704712323d0ef",

    "title": "Great Time to Scoop up Some AMD!",
    "selftext": "I believe the market is overreacting to AMD Q4 earnings, representing a great time to add some shares. Let's get into it.\n\n**Q4 Highlights -**\n\n* Revenue of $7,658 billion, 24% increase YoY.\n* Gross Profit of $3,882, 33% increase YoY.\n* Increased Gross Margin of 51%.\n* Operating Income of $871 million, 155% increase YoY.\n* Data Center segment revenue of $3.9 billion, 69% increase YoY.\n\n**Full Year Financial Highlights 2024 -**\n\n* Revenue of $25,785 billion, 14% increase.\n* Gross Profit of $12,725 billion, 22% increase.\n* Net Income of $1,641, 92% increase.\n* Data Center revenue of $12,6 billion, 94% increase.\n* Client segment revenue of $7.1 billion, 52% increase.\n\n**My Thoughts & Interpretation of Q4 -** Looking at these numbers, they all seem pretty great. AMD posted a record year in just about every category. They continue to secure deals like the ones made with IBM in November, and with Dell in January. They also continue to innovate with new product releases in order to stay competitive. Investors simply got spooked because of the revenue miss for data centers and lower than expected GPU sales. Is this enough cause for concern? I think not. I find it ridiculous that they experienced 69% growth YoY for Q4 data center revenue, and still got wrecked after earnings, with a 94% increase in the segment for the entire year! The way I see it, they are demonstrating their ability to capture market share. Not to mention they posted record revenue in the client segment. They gave strong guidance, expecting revenue for Q1 2025 of $7.1 billion, which would be 30% YoY growth. This is all bullish to me.\n\n**Key Financial Metrics -** Gross profit as a percentage of sales has been trending upwards for years, now sitting at 53%. This signifies good management and increasing operational efficiency. They have a very low FWD PEG of .57 and FWD P/B ratio of 3.14 representing undervaluation. \n\n**Average 5-Year Growth Rates -** Revenue Growth = 33.91%. Net Income = 36.92%. EBITDA Growth = 65.27%. FCF Per Share = 68.86%. Working Capital = 44.21%.\n\n**Conclusion -** I think this is a great company that is simply unloved by the market currently. They have done nothing but demonstrate their ability to innovate and compete over the years. This is a trend that I do not see slowing down. The most recent dip presents a great buy opportunity as the price will correct eventually. **At a price per share of $111, I think AMD trades at a bargain considering future growth and the overall potential of the company. $200+ is on the horizon.** \\*Que Advanced Money Destroyer jokes\\*\n\n**Position -** \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qr36cqw10ghe1.png?width=324&format=png&auto=webp&s=bab980cd9558ebd95af8077e688a751f3472a352\n\n\n\n",

I had anticipated the earnings figures with remarkable accuracy\u2014including the slight deviations in the data center segment\u2014 eventhough, from a fundamental perspective, a price movement toward the 160-170 area seemed like the most rational outcome. Given the revenue growth, margin expansion, and the broader AI-driven demand cycle, a post-earnings sell-off of this magnitude defies conventional market logic. The only plausible explanation? A large-scale liquidation cascade, likely orchestrated by market makers exploiting leveraged positions.\n\nLuckily, I managed to recover a bit with ThyssenKrupp and a PennyStock i won't tell ya, so it\u2019s not a total disaster. Still, I think I\u2019ll stick to regular stock buys from now on\u2014certificates just feel like a rigged game, where the house always has the edge.\n\nAt least I can laugh about it. Next time, less or no leverage, more patience, and maybe a strong coffee before making any bold plays. May your trades stay green and your margin calls remain a distant nightmare!\n\nLive long and prosper! \ud83d\udd96\ud83c\udffd",

    "title": "Guys, GOOG and AMD are releasing earnings today.",
    "selftext": "I'm re-writing to better along with WSB's rules. Alphabet Inc, the parent company of Google, is scheduled to release its fourth-quarter earnings today, February 4, 2025, after the market closes. Analysts anticipate earnings of $2.13 per share on revenue of $96.7 billion, up from $1.64 per share on $86.3 billion the previous year.\n\nI'm really interested in hearing about the company's substantial investments in artificial intelligence and the performance of its cloud services. They have been integrating its latest AI model (Gemini 2.0) across various products and services.\n\nGoogle Workspace and Sheets, their AI can now analyze data trends and automatically generating static charts, which can be inserted into spreadsheets Gemini AI is also now embedded within Google Cloud services, offering generative AI tools that enhance creativity and productivity. This integration aids in tasks such as code generation, data analysis, and the development of AI-driven applications. Subscribers to the Google One AI Premium Plan gain access to Gemini Advanced features, including enhanced AI capabilities across Google apps, 2 TB of cloud storage, and other premium services. And of course on Android and Pixel devices, Gemini AI powers features like Expressive Captions, which not only transcribe speech but also capture non-speech elements such as sighs and gasps, providing a more comprehensive understanding of audio content. Their AI is also being integrated into Google Search and the Chrome browser, enhancing the user experience with more intuitive and intelligent features. They claim that this should improve search results, personalized recommendations, and advance browsing capabilities. Maybe.\n\nIn the cloud sector, Google Cloud is expected to report a 32% rise in revenue for the fourth quarter, following a 35% increase in the previous quarter. This growth rate surpasses that of competitors like Microsoft's Azure and Amazon Web Services. As of right now the stock has already risen 6.9% this year and 41% over the past twelve months, reflecting investor confidence in the company's strategic direction.\n\nAs Alphabet prepares to announce its earnings, I wanna know how the company leverages its AI advancements and cloud services to drive future growth. So with that said, is anyone else playing earnings?\n\nNext, I wanted to talk about AMD. They are set to report its fourth-quarter earnings today, From what I've read, analysts anticipate a 22% year-over-year revenue increase to $7.53 billion, with adjusted earnings per share (EPS) expected to rise to $1.09 from $0.77 in the same period last year. Just like Google, I'm focused on checking out AMD's advancements in artificial intelligence. The company has recently unveiled several AI-centric products, including the 5th Gen AMD EPYC processors and the AMD Instinct MI325X accelerators, aiming to enhance performance in data centers and enterprise applications.\n\nBut despite these innovations, AMD faces challenges in the AI chip market, primarily due to Nvidia's dominance and the trend of major tech companies developing custom silicon. Looking online, it looks like analysts are predicting that AMD's revenue from AI chips could reach $10 billion this year, driven by growth in the data center segment.\n\nAnd in the personal computing sector, AMD has expanded its AI capabilities with the introduction of the Ryzen AI 300 Series processors, featuring up to eight \"Zen 5\" CPU cores and the latest RDNA 3.5 graphics architecture.hese processors aim to deliver enhanced AI performance for consumer and commercial applications.\n\nSimilarly to the GOOG call, I will be closely monitoring how the company leverages its AI advancements to drive future growth and compete in the evolving semiconductor landscape. But I'm fairly bearish on AMD.",

    "title": "DD: What is going on with China's recent developments in quantum computing?",
    "selftext": "Google [Tianyan-504](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=tianyan-504&t=newext&atb=v452-1&ia=web). Google [Zuchongzhi 3.0](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=tianyan-504&t=newext&atb=v452-1&ia=web). Google it, right now. Who\u2019s reporting this? China is right behind the USA in quantum computing research, and the markets don't seem to have a clue.\n\nTL;DR: Simply put, I believe the markets have not reacted to China\u2019s most recent advancements in quantum computing. China is potentially not as far behind the USA as markets would have you believe. I provide here a commentary of recent market movements, in relation to recent quantum computing news and developments. I follow with a more technical discussion of the significance of China\u2019s advancements, those of US corporations.\n\nFinancial disclaimer: While I justify my comments where possible, some of the comments I make in this post are pure speculation. I do not recommend making speculative trades, such as shorting quantum computing, or buying quantum cybersecurity. I am not a financial advisor, and this is not financial advice.\n\nI was astounded to see the latest news dominating the headlines. How did the market not know that China was developing its own language-learning models? I\u2019m a filthy casual, and even I knew about it. It\u2019s been in our news at least [since July](https://www.marktechpost.com/2024/07/20/deepseek-v2-0628-released-an-improved-open-source-version-of-deepseek-v2/), and available for use [since September last year](https://api-docs.deepseek.com/news/news0905). It was pretty fucking good back then, too. And there\u2019s Alibaba\u2019s Qwenchat, Tencent\u2019s HunYuan, among numerous others they haven\u2019t even started talking about yet. What else have they forgotten, in this wild speculative bull run? They probably think the USA is lightyears ahead in quantum computing too. Oh, oh. They do.\n\nBefore you go any further, look up [Tianyan-504](https://english.cas.cn/newsroom/cas_media/202412/t20241206_893281.shtml). Look up [Zuchongzhi 3.0](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.11924). Google them, right now. They\u2019re right there, massive Chinese developments both announced in December 2024. The Tianyan-504 surpasses 500 qubits, on par with IBM\u2019s latest developments. And Zuchongzhi 3.0 demolishes Google\u2019s earlier Sycamore by all key metrics. Why can\u2019t we find any article produced by any reputable financial sources, that discuss the significance of these achievements? There is essentially zero market news about it. China is right behind the USA in quantum computing research, and the market has no fucking clue.\n\nCheck out D-Wave stock prices, for example. Given their business model relies in part on how they contribute to research in the field, they should be negatively impacted by major research developments in competing economies.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4iggbqnq57ge1.png?width=602&format=png&auto=webp&s=f5089134b48021f96baf28b66e5a7dc377b7dee7\n\nThis suggests that while Google\u2019s Willow breakthrough rallied quantum computing stocks and Nvidia\u2019s CEO pushed them back down, China\u2019s developments have had zero impact.\n\nHow about Quantum Computing Inc (QUBT)? It tells a similar story. Their focus is on fabrication of photonic quantum computing components \u2013 and again, providing researchers access to quantum computing technology. It looks like Google\u2019s Willow breakthrough rallied stocks, and Nvidia\u2019s CEO pushed them back down. China\u2019s developments have had zero impact.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/e9dnfa0s57ge1.png?width=602&format=png&auto=webp&s=f77fb7a50a22340541b4c426433ff210c9a7fbe0\n\nHow about IBM? News about Google\u2019s Willow pushed their price down some 3%, which makes good sense. Willow\u2019s performace blew that of IBM\u2019s September R2 Heron processor out of the water. Willow is a competitor, but IBM\u2019s position in the market means they are diversified in so much more than just quantum computing. A small bearish reaction makes perfect sense. So when Tianyan-504 reportedly challenged IBM's benchmarks just three days before Willow did, why didn\u2019t the stock price move?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y6t1ik5t57ge1.png?width=602&format=png&auto=webp&s=5377770391681d2bfe3ac54d106217216c3f7feb\n\nYou can look at SkyWater Technologies (SKYT), and at Global Foundries (GFS), and Rigetti (RGTI), Alphabet (GOOGL), Intel (INTC), TSM (TSM), Keysight Technologies (KEYS), and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). Every one of these key companies relevant to advancing quantum computing in the Western World have one thing in common. When China announces their developments, the markets appear to stay still.\n\nThere are three possible reasons for this that I have come up with. There may be other reasons as well that I am not aware of, in which case I encourage you to enlighten me.\n\nThe first possible reason is as above: The market is generally not aware. It is likely that some players in the market are aware, and this is a simple piece of information that such players will be taking advantage of \u2013 they do not have incentive to highlight this knowledge. Furthermore, the market may be uniquely slow to react. Unlike DeepSeek, which we can physically interact with, breaking records in quantum computing research is less tangible, less sensational. Breaking news, markets are irrational.\n\nThe second possible reason is simple: China may be lying. I can not find any evidence to support this idea, and China\u2019s past claims about quantum computing, such as those about [Jiuzhang](https://asiatimes.com/2023/10/china-unveils-faster-light-based-quantum-computer/), have been demonstrably true.\n\nThe third possible reason is that China\u2019s quantum computers are not as technically advanced as they sound. Originally I wanted to follow with a full technical discussion about the recent history of Chinese Quantum computing, and the merits of Tianyan-504 and Zuchongzhi 3.0 in comparison to western quantum computing efforts. But since I am not a subject matter expert, and I do not have the time to write in full depth. But I will provide a bit more technical information, summarise and provide references to the academic research for relevant breakthrough technologies, so you can read for yourself.\n\nChina is fighting to lead the global race in quantum computing, and [the Chinese government has been investing tens of billions of dollars into quantum computing research](https://thequantuminsider.com/2023/04/13/chinese-quantum-companies-and-national-strategy-2023/), alongside the investments of Chinese institutions and corporations.\n\nIn 2020 [Jiuzhang, developed at the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), was the second quantum computer in the world to achieve quantum supremacy](https://asiatimes.com/2023/10/china-unveils-faster-light-based-quantum-computer/), and the first photonic quantum computer to do so. Since then, the university has gone on to create further models of Jiuzhang, and develop chips with greater qubit lifetime and fidelity.\n\nIn April 2024, The Center for Excellence in Quantum Information and Quantum Physics developed their [Xiaohong superconducting chip](https://english.news.cn/20240425/a95b3c190a59486886f4cddc0def31cd/c.html), their most advanced to date, anticipated to reach the chip performance levels of main international cloud-enabled quantum computing platforms such as IBM\u2019s Heron in key performance metrics including qubit lifetime (how long a qubit can hold its quantum state) and readout fidelity (accuracy in extracting information from qubits). I note the market did not appear to react to the Xiaohong chip either.\n\nOn the 13^(th) of November 2024,[ IBM announced their Quantum Heron R2](https://www.ibm.com/quantum/blog/qdc-2024), achieving their goal of running quantum circuits with up to 5,000 two-qubit gates, demonstrating advancements in in qubit lifetime and readout fidelity.\n\nOn the 6^(th) of December 2024, [Tianyan-504 was announced](https://english.cas.cn/newsroom/cas_media/202412/t20241206_893281.shtml), developed by China Telecom Quantum Group (CTQG) in partnership with the Chinese Academy of Sciences and QuantumCTek Co., Ltd., and, built on the Xiaohong chips. China is now the only country to achieve quantum computational advantage through both photonics and superconducting quantum computing technologies. This quantum computer will be incorporated into their quantum computing cloud platform, and made available for researcher purposes.On the 9^(th) of December, [Google\u2019s Willow was announced](https://blog.google/technology/research/google-willow-quantum-chip/). What makes Willow exceptional, is that it provides a breakthrough solution to quantum computing\u2019s fidelity issue. It exponentially reduces the amount of error while adding more qubits. Presumably Willow can now be scaled further, and I expect to see further developments with adding more qubits now that this challenge has been solved.\n\nTwo weeks later, on the 16^(th) of December 2024, an entirely separate research team with the China Telecom Quantum Group (CTQG) in partnership with the Chinese Academy of Sciences and QuantumCTek Co., Ltd. [announced their Zuchongzhi 3.0](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.11924v1#S1). This superconducting quantum computer makes numerous advancements, and demonstrates quantum advantage through speed. It crushes benchmarks set by Google\u2019s older Sycamore - \u201cCompared to Google\u2019s latest experiment, SYC-67 and SYC-70\u00a0 the classical simulation cost of our 83-qubit, 32-cycle experiment is six orders of magnitude higher.\u201d Though Zuchongzhi 3.0 does not demonstrate the error correction capability that Willow does, their creators have commented that they believe they can replicate the same techniques in a matter of months.\n\nQuantum computing is still twenty years away from being relevant, they say. That gives lots of time for China to catch up. And from what I can understand, China is just one breakthrough away. There are other questions, such as China\u2019s chip manufacturing capabilities, supply chains for components, that I am unable to find good information on. The US is doing what they can politically, through trade regulation, and restricting financial investment in China\u2019s technologies. China already has the [lead in quantum communications, and potentially in quantum sensing](https://itif.org/publications/2024/09/09/how-innovative-is-china-in-quantum/). But China holds one massive advantage: it\u2019s regime. In contrast to the American model, where corporations closely guard their own secrets from eachother, [China is claims they invest 15 billion of dollars into coordinated, cohesive research.](https://itif.org/publications/2024/09/09/how-innovative-is-china-in-quantum/) And it is showing in their results.\n\nEach advancement that China makes in developing its quantum computing capability, ought to remind the market that there is a risk that the lead the US enjoys in quantum computing is being threatened. But look at those google search results again. Outside of technical circles, the western media simply hasn't picked it up. Look at what happened with DeepSeek. I think the markets just don't know. Investors are already anxious about their investments in quantum computing, and are starting to demand returns. Manufacturers are reluctant to scale component production, given the low demand and potential for volatility. So when the market does find out about China\u2019s achievements in quantum computing, what's going to happen?\n\nLet me know what you think.\n\nDisclosure of positions:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qlgr3l7w57ge1.png?width=678&format=png&auto=webp&s=d480c14a5164357c4a951a0033a861631ea589f8\n\n",

    "title": "Intel will be the surprise overperformer in 2025, starting with the 1/30 ER.",
    "selftext": "Before I start, I want to preface this by acknowledging the memes and negative connection between intel and the one guy who lost his grandma's funds, but I genuinely believe with how low st. expectations are, combined with intel's massive sell-off these few months, Intel will skyrocket leading up/during the ER @ 1/30/2025.\n\n# 1. Extremely heavy Investments in Manufacturing\n\n* **Tens of Billions Invested**: Intel has invested heavily in manufacturing expansion, aiming to regain technological leadership. These investments are expected to start bearing fruit by 2026 and 2027, positioning Intel as a key U.S.-based semiconductor manufacturer.\n   * Now I know ya'll are gonna complain, but that's 2026 and 2027, which is a long ways out! Here's the thing, as long as (they will) Intel acknowleges their progress towards manufacturing, and the expected returns of their investments, especially under the current administration, the upside will be more or less priced in within the report.\n* **Alignment with U.S. Government Priorities**: U.S. policy encourages domestic manufacturing of semiconductors, especially with the new Mango administration.\n   * It's pretty obvious that the current admin wants to become less dependent on foreign semiconductor manufacturing, and Intel's investments in the space PLUS mango being in power will undoubtedly be great for the stock, and I believe that's what Intel will lean into heavily during the upcoming earnings report with stellar guidance.\n\n# 2. Undervalued Stock Price\n\n* **Current Valuation**: Intel is trading at one of its lowest forward Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratios of the year, at around 20.\n* **Intrinsic Value**: Updated discounted cash flow (DCF) valuation indicates an intrinsic value of $36 per share, significantly higher than the current trading price of $19.82. While there may be some other factors, this suggests Intel is trading on a pretty steep discount compared to its market value, way less than other big names.\n\n# 3. Advanced Developments\n\n* **Advanced Node Development**: Intel is investing in advanced manufacturing nodes to close the gap with competitors like TSMC and Samsung. Success in these nodes will make Intel competitive in high-margin markets.\n   * I'll admit, I'm not entirely familiar with the development process of these, but I can't imagine this not being bullish for the stock.\n* **Gaudi AI Chips**: The release of competitive AI chips (e.g., Gaudi 3) positions Intel to capture a share of the rapidly growing AI market.\n\n# 4. Reduced Competition in Dual Design-Manufacturing Model\n\n* **Unique Positioning**: Intel and Micron remain the only U.S.-based companies pursuing both design and manufacturing, while most competitors focus on design alone. This vertical integration could yield huge advantages as Intel scales.\n   * Again, I'm not familiar with the development of chips, but from what I could find, if Intel could pull this off in the long-run, it'll set itself in an extremely unique environment with both design and manufacturing WITHIN the United States. Would be huge for the nation-first agenda under the current administration.\n\n# 5. Support from Geopolitical Tailwinds\n\n* **CHIPS Act Benefits**: Intel is set to benefit from U.S. government incentives under the CHIPS Act, including grants and tax credits for domestic semiconductor manufacturing.\n   * Again, huge for a US-based company like Intel.\n\n# 6. Potential Leadership Turnaround\n\n* **CEO Transition**: A change in leadership could bring new strategic clarity and execution capability, particularly in aligning investment timelines with profitability goals.\n   * Though Pat was a pretty chill guy, if Intel could bring in someone with large amounts of industry experience, that's another huge upside potential for Intel. They may announce a new CEO during ER or somewhere near it, but I just can't imagine them settling with a mid-tier guy after what they've been through.\n\n# 7. Market Share Opportunities\n\n* **Competitor Weaknesses**: AMD and Nvidia focus on niche areas, leaving room for Intel to grow in data centers, personal computing, and automotive applications.\n   * Yes, this does mean that their areas would be very hard to break into, but we've already seen Intel turning around in some aspects, especially their newer desktop gaming GPUs which actually bring in surprising value for performance beyond AMD and Nvidia comparable cards.\n* **U.S. Government Contracts**: Intel\u2019s U.S.-based manufacturing advantage makes it a preferred supplier for defense and other government projects, which is yet another large catalyst for the future.\n\n# 8. Focused Financial Discipline\n\n* **Cost Reductions**: Intel has paused dividends and reduced workforce to save over $10 billion by 2025, stabilizing its financial position during this investment-heavy period.\n   * I expect to see this being reflected upon in the upcoming 1/30 ER. With a bit more cash freed up and stabilizing finances, I'm pretty confident that it'll be far beyond what the market has been pricing in which is arguably a worst case doomsday scenario.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nYes, Intel does have a decent amount of debt. Yes, nana's son did lose hundreds of thousands. But it's objectively true that INTC has been beaten down mercilessly these past few months, with a 56% drawdown since the start of 2024. It's entirely possible- likely even- that this is a far overreaction, especially with INTC taking steps to improve leadership, control debts, free up cash, and invest in what's needed. Combine that with the new administration that went into power yesterday, focusing on heavy domestic production, I believe Intel will be the surprise overperformer for this year.\n\nNFA. I hold around $10k in calls expiring next month after the ER, and I am planning on DCAing aggressively into shares to hold for a few years.\n\n[T](https://preview.redd.it/jmpxjozifgee1.png?width=556&format=png&auto=webp&s=15c4f3a652f7e8b44bdedaaf0a9075939f3cf952)",

So I invested my own money. \n\nHere's why I like Intel:\n\n* 2024 Q1 up 9% YOY\n* Intel has been heavily investing and restructuring by building out the domestic foundry business to manufacture semiconductor chips for third party companies.\n* With Intel 3 in production, leading-edge semiconductors are being manufactured in the US for the first time in a decade. Intel will regain process leadership as the Intel Foundry continues to grow.\n* I think the fact that Intel is positioning itself to be the largest semiconductor manufacturer in the US is massive. The US Gov is heavily prioritizing domestic semiconductor production and thus is heavily supporting Intel as a company with R&D funding.\n* If NVIDIA or AMD are ever forced to change manufacturers due to rising tensions/war between China & Taiwan, Intel will likely be a sole or largest manufacturer for NVIDIA and AMD\n* Intel has been heavily investing in R&D. 5.9B out of 12.7B of Q124 revenue was invested in R&D.\n* Intel is on track to exceed its forecast of 40 million AI PCs shipped by the end of 2024\n* The Intel Gaudi 3AI accelerator is projected to deliver 50% faster inference and 40% greater inference power efficiency than NVIDIA H100 on leading AI models.\n* Trading at Forward PE of 17.05\n* Geopolitical tensions will ultimately work in Intel's favor more than any other company in this industry\n* I like the stock and I think its really cheap rn :)",

This number is going to continue its rapid rise due to key acquisitions and product innovation. Lisa Su estimates the market for data center AI accelerators to grow at a CAGR of 60% until the year 2028. That would value the market at $500 billion for things like CPUs, GPU\u2019s, FPGA\u2019s, and ASIC\u2019s. Obviously, Nvidia currently dominates the market. Despite this, there is room for multiple players and AMD has shown their ability to capture market share. In 2022, they surpassed Intel in both market value and annual revenue, positioning themselves as the clear number two player in the market. I've said it before with companies like Palantir, data is the future and every company needs it. Well in order for a company to have data, you need chips. Everything needs chips. We are still in a small and juvenile market that has massive amounts of room to grow.\n\n**Acquisition of ZT Systems** \\- Announced in August 2024, AMD will acquire ZT Systems for $4.9 billion. The deal is expected to be finalized in the first half of 2025. ZT specializes in designing and deploying data center AI computing and storage solutions. This shows the focus and commitment AMD has to their fastest growing segment.\u00a0\n\n**Strong Belief in Lisa Su -** Lisa Su is an amazing CEO with a strong desire for excellency. After becoming CEO in 2014, she has completely turned around the company and continues to improve it.\u00a0Here is a great video to watch of her - [https://youtu.be/8Ve5SAFPYZ8](https://youtu.be/8Ve5SAFPYZ8)\n\n\u00a0\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3qpschsr28be1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=748614c675bbb1456dd4e69c61f7c5334af523fe\n\n**Conclusion** \\- AMD is gaining significant amounts of market share for data centers, a trend that will continue as the market grows. Despite declines in the gaming and embedded segments, the company overall continues to grow revenues. The decline in gaming looks alarming but it makes sense. New gen consoles came out 4 years ago which AMD supplies chips for. Regardless, what I\u2019m focused on here is the data center growth. AMD is innovative and managed extremely well which can be seen by continuously improving operating margins and FCF. This company will continue to become a monster.\u00a0At a current price of **$125,** I expect this to easily get back to **$200+** in 2025 giving a solid 60% upside.",

Nvidia tasked a single engineer to us for technical support, but we didn\u2019t run into any Nvidia software bugs as such we didn\u2019t need much support.\n\n\\- AMD\u2019s Out of the Box Experience is very difficult to work with and can require considerable patience and elbow grease to move towards a usable state. On most of our benchmarks, Public AMD stable releases of AMD PyTorch is still broken and we needed workarounds.\n\n\\- If we weren\u2019t supported by multiple teams of AMD engineers triaging and fixing bugs in AMD software that we ran into, AMD\u2019s results would have been much lower than Nvidia\u2019s.\n\n\\- We ran unofficial MLPerf Training GPT-3 175B on 256 H100 in collaboration with Sustainable Metal Cloud to test the effects of different VBoost setting\n\n\\- For AMD, Real World Performance on public stable released software is nowhere close to its on paper marketed TFLOP/s. Nvidia\u2019s real world performance also undershoots its marketing TFLOP/s, but not by nearly as much.\n\n\\- The MI300X has a lower total cost of ownership (TCO) compared to the H100/H200, but training performance per TCO is higher on the MI300X on public stable releases of AMD software. This changes if one uses custom development builds of AMD software.\n\n\\- Training performance is weaker, as demonstrated by the MI300X \u2018s matrix multiplication micro-benchmarks, and AMD public release software on single-node training throughput still lags that of Nvidia\u2019s H100 and H200.\n\n\\- MI300X performance is held back by AMD software. AMD MI300X software on BF16 development branches have better performance but has not yet merged into the main branch of AMD\u2019s internal repos. By the time it gets merged into the main branch and into the PyTorch stable release, Nvidia Blackwell will have already been available to everyone.\n\n\\- AMD\u2019s training performance is also held back as the MI300X does not deliver strong scale out performance. This is due to its weaker ROCm Compute Communication Library (RCCL) and AMD\u2019s lower degree of vertical integration with networking and switching hardware compared to Nvidia\u2019s strong integration of its Nvidia Collective Communications Library (NCCL), InfiniBand/Spectrum-X network fabric and switches.\n\n\\- Many of AMD AI Libraries are forks of NVIDIA AI Libraries, leading to suboptimal outcomes and compatibility issues.\n\n\\- AMD customers tend to use hand crafted kernels only for inference, which means their performance outside of very narrow well defined use cases is poor, and their flexibility to rapidly shifting workloads is non-existent.",

    "selftext": "Right now, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, and Meta are all spending more than Nvidia on R&D and are developing their own AI chips. Tesla, and AMD are also developing AI chips. Right now, tech companies are only buying Nvidia's chips to get started and build market share, because they do not want to fall behind their competition. \n\nUsing Nvidia's chips at current prices is not profitable, even successful AI companies such as OpenAI fail to achieve positive operating margins despite a highly popular product with paid features. Large tech companies are reluctantly buying Nvidia's hardware to avoid falling behind their competition in market share. But relying on Nvidia long term is never the intention, these companies need to be profitable eventually, Nvidia is just there to get them started.\n\nThe thing is, Nvidia's 74.56% gross margin is a strength, but its also a vulnerability. It demonstrates that any AI company that can cut out Nvidia can significantly reduce their costs, and that's why everyone is building their own chips. They don't need to be faster than Nvidia to succeed, they just need to be fast enough to provide services at a lower cost, which is quite a low bar. Developing new products takes time, which is why Nvidia's windfall has lasted. But give it 1-3 more years and you'll start to see the impact on Nvidia's sales.\n\nWith everyone rushing to develop their own chips, and all of them relying on TSMC, TSMC has the true windfall. They will certainly be able to hike their prices on wafers due to increased demand, which will hurt Nvidia's margins.\n\nIntel was once a dominant and unstoppable player in the semiconductor space, but then they got too comfortable and started spending their cash flow on dividends and stock buybacks instead of reinvesting in R&D. We see how that played out, with AMD catching up and stealing market share, and now Intel is struggling. No moat is impenetrable.\n\nNvidia is following in Intel's footsteps with their $50 Billion stock buyback plan at 50x earnings. Despite facing competition from the largest tech companies with deep pockets, they are spending their record windfall just to buy back less than 2% of their shares outstanding. This will be their downfall. They are not hedging their reliance on TSMC by seeking to acquire or develop their own fab business, they are not increasing R&D sufficiently to stay ahead of their competition. This will be their downfall.\n\nIn 5-10 years, Nvidia will almost certainly have thinner margins and less market share in the AI space as their customers develop their own in-house solutions. At best, Nvidia will be relied upon for niche applications where performance is essential.",

Also, by valuation, the software makers are considerably underinflated in price when compared to their chip maker equivalents.  \n  \nI like the software play here for longer term holds - IGV and HACK are things I'm eyeing.   \nAnother thing to consider is NVDA launches new products in January, but then again Trumps Tariffs start in January also.",

    "title": "$AMD Bottoms Within the Next $10",
    "selftext": "Intro:  \nMany of you are probably pretty tired of $AMD. The last 8 or so months of downtrend is pretty deterring, especially while $NVDA continues to tear upwards. You're also probably tired of seeing hopium posts in the midst of tons of bear posts. I think most agree that fundamentally $AMD is a great company that should not be negative YTD. For those of you that have been waiting a long time to see it catch a bid off of the AI hype and necessity for chips, I think the wait is coming to an end. It's easy to point at the institutions and hedge funds and blame them for nuking the price, but hopefully with this thesis I can show that $AMD structurally is ready to reverse. To the untrained eye, the chart displayed should be easy to read, you can see the similarities between the two corrections quite easily. If any of you see any holes in this thesis please let me know. \"but institutional buying/selling,  unusual options, market dominance,\" Yea IDGAF about all that, just let me know if there are holes in the technical analysis.  If you don't want to read, I'll sum it up briefly:  AMD will bottom at $114-$121, followed by an HTF extension to $330.\n\nLength of Corrections, Fibonacci Levels, Timing of Earnings & Structure:  \nThe first correction pictured lasted \\~315 days, bottoming \\~21 days from prior to earnings. The current correction is pacing to also finish within the golden pocket ($114-$122, where institutions have most interest in buying), matching the length of the previous correction and also \\~21 days off of the next earnings. Earnings are marked in blue vertical lines on the chart. As you can see with our current correction, we are likely in the final wave of our ABCDE correction. There is a small chance we could skip the golden pocket and shoot for the 0.236 @ $96, but this is quite unlikely. The run up that followed the previous correction saw price top at $227, nearly touching our 1.618 extension at $232. If we see the same process unfold: A bounce and run up from the pocket, we could expect our 1.618 to be @ $333 per share, pictured in the top right.\n\nMACD & RSI:  \nOnce again, If you just study the structure of the MACD underneath the two corrections, it is easy to see how close they are in form. I'm not going to attempt to explain each cross and describe what I am seeing in words, the charts speak for themselves for MACD. RSI during the previous correction saw a low highlighted in green at the bottom at 32. The previous two run ups both peaked at 82, and I would like to think it is highly likely RSI will bottom at 32 again, currently sitting at 39. This one it is also easy to see the similarities in structure on the chart. MACD and RSI showing the same structure as the last correction before a 300% run with a bottom going into earnings is possibly the most bullish copy and paste set up I have seen in a long time.\n\nConclusion:  \nI don't wish to spread more lackluster hopium for this stock. I am trying to make the point that structurally, if it were to bottom and reverse, within the next month would be the most logical place for this to occur. Hopefully, those that have been burned holding this stock understand that it simply just needed time to cool off after that 300% run. Once markets find the price has been pushed low enough it should begin another, it's literally illustrated in the charts. I could be wrong. There could be more downside after the golden pocket, but this is a play I am willing to lose money on because it meets every checkmark presented from an analysis view. If it folds I cannot be upset because I stuck with the rules and didn't put money somewhere else that didn't look as structurally sound.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4db1zbjif47e1.png?width=1986&format=png&auto=webp&s=57abbf74331f5857fb91e6ef0f268cb52a05eaaf\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tzt3rbjif47e1.png?width=1041&format=png&auto=webp&s=fe50da34618b81e15498ceae774c499fa74c2e2e\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fhylvbjif47e1.png?width=1055&format=png&auto=webp&s=5bf3fc1515ce97ebea425272944f138afe998020\n\n",

    "selftext": "AI has been developing rapidly for the last few years and it's becoming clear that it is not going away anymore. Let's zoom out a bit. What is a good strategy to capitalize on a still very young industry with new players joining every day? I'm currently seeing three main segments that drive revenue with a TAM that's rapidly expanding across all three segments:\n\n**Infrastructure**\nCompanies like Nvidia, AMD, Microsoft and Oracle are building chips and datacenters to generate compute. All of the MAG7 companies are investing heavily in their own facilities to become a big player in the scene without any sign of slowing down.\n\n**Data**\nThe place the internet comes together is a goldmine for LLM's to be trained on. Places Like X (Twitter) (owned by xAI) GitHub (owned by Microsoft, very valuable for coding), Stack overflow, Wikipedia, Quora, but maybe the biggest and most valuable of them all, yes, Reddit. A very important aspect of why Reddit's conversations are very valuable is because there is no money incentive like on X. The company has gone public in 2024 and has done licensing deals with Google and OpenAI and others worth 200M+ annually. They are reportedly currently in talks with Google for a much bigger deal. The platform is imo mildly monetized and thus growing rapidly. A company worth looking into financially.\n\n**Applications**\nProbably the biggest and widest segment that has yet to fully materialize is the way AI has been putting itself on the market as a product. The most obvious applications are LLM's like ChatGPT, but OpenAI is not close to profitability. Self-Driving cars are also slowly being applied, but in low numbers. Public companies like Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon, Salesforce and Palantir are among a bigger group of companies well positioned to thrive in this segment.\n\nAI is no longer just a buzzword. The companies that control infrastructure, data, or applications are setting the rules of the game. The next few years are going to separate the leaders from the followers. If you\u2019re looking to understand where value is being created, AI is still a an early opportunity.",

Building up a foundry business is crucial for Intel to execute its turnaround and compete more closely with the world-leading Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing.\n>\n> \u201cThis looks like a product deal, not a foundry deal,\u201d at least at the moment, Bernstein Research analyst Stacy Rasgon said in a note. \u201cBut frankly Intel can use the help on the product business just as much given share position in key markets has been bleeding.\u201d\n\n...\n\n> The agreement shows how some industry executives view efforts to help Intel as a way to win favor with the Trump administration. SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son saw his recent investment in Intel as a way to appeal to the president.\n> \n> Trump administration officials have been talking to Huang and other chip-industry leaders from AMD and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing for months about how they could potentially help Intel. Lutnick has discussed possible financial help and ways they could boost Intel\u2019s manufacturing business.\n\n...\n\n> Because of the government\u2019s involvement in both Nvidia and Intel, many around the industry raised an eyebrow at Thursday\u2019s deal.\n>\n> \u201cIt is perhaps unprecedented that a company with a unique revenue sharing agreement with the U.S. government is investing so much money in a company that\u2019s partially owned by the U.S. government,\u201d said Ryan Fedasiuk, a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank.\n>\n> One of Huang\u2019s top priorities is getting Trump administration approval for a version of Nvidia\u2019s Blackwell GPU - its leading-edge AI processor - for sale in China. Trump has said that he would consider giving an export license to such a chip if its capabilities were reduced by 30% or more.\n\nThis makes me doubt the long term prospects for Intel here. It seems like Nvidia is investing this money to help their China export prospects and gain favor with the current admin, and it won't help Intel's foundry struggles.. so that means TSMC will likely continue being the winner regardless \n\nAs a long term $INTC bagholder, should I sell?",

    "selftext": "Hi folks! I'm looking for some feedback and looking for some discussion around my current stock portfolio!\n\nI understand that most people don't out-perform the market (SP500, etc,.) over the long-term but I personally enjoy investing and want to generate some out-performance/alpha in my own individual portfolio in the long-term. In my retirement accounts (Roth IRA + 401k), I hold 100% SP500 index funds so these stocks are only held in my taxable individual account.\n\nI'm still learning a-lot and my investment philosophy is still evolving (most recently by consuming a lot of content by Warren Buffet, Charlie Munger, Chris Hohn, Dev Kantesaria, and Bill Ackman) so there's actually a good number of stocks here that I actually don't want to own anymore - but am looking at a more opportune time to sell them. \n\nMy current holdings are roughly (figures are rounded):\n\n**Amazon (AMZN) - 19%** \\- Have always liked AMZN as it's been a company with a diversified set of businesses with mostly good business models and are dominant in many of those areas. Particularly happy with the cloud business (AWS) and their ads business (from my understanding - they have an extremely strong moat and competitive advantage here they have so much data on customer's shopping habits).\n\n**ASML (ASML) - 15%** \\- Bought into this position mostly throughout the year by DCAing the dips. My view on this business is that they have a near monopoly in their space which gives them very strong pricing power (which they can leverage to increase their FCF/EPS/Net-Income even in the absence of revenue or volume growth). The stock seems to be beaten down due to risks from losing business in China (and also potential competition from them) but I'm not ***too concerned*** about this. In the worst case they become a global duopoly/oligopoly which is not too shabby.\n\n**Fidelity 500 Index Fund (FXAIX) - 11%** \\- Owned this when I initially started the portfolio.\n\n**Alphabet (GOOGL) - 10%** \\- Mostly bought into this throughout the dips in the past few years. Similar to Amazon, a very large set of diversified businesses where they're very dominant in like Youtube, Google Cloud (they compete with AWS, Azure, and OCI and they're third in the race and that's fine with me), Waymo, Ads, and Search. In the worst case, they lose their MOAT in search but from my understanding, the rest of their businesses can make up their current valuation in < 5 years. Anecdotally speaking as a developer, I still use Google search since they added AI overview since it's essentially a combination of an LLM answer + google search together. \n\n**Meta Platforms (META) - 7.5%** \\- The core of my position was from 2022 dips. They're just a cash generating machine from their balance sheet and they have a strong moat in the social media space. Not much to say about this since I bought this at around $120 - but happy to own this since Zucc is so ambitious and has done a good job at growing since IPO.\n\n**Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) - 6% -** Bought most of this position back in 2024 when it was in the $110/$120 range. Not much personally to say about this, I like the CEO and think there can be multiple winners in the GPU space.\n\n**Mastercard (MA) - 6% -** They take money off of every card transaction and have a oligopoly. Card payments are still growing globally so I'm just happy to own this. Financials look amazing! \n\n**Paypal (PYPL) - 5%** \\- I mostly bought this because it was very undervalued from a technical standpoint (i.e very high FCF yield). While their FCF/share is going to drastically increase due to their aggressive buybacks - I really do want to sell this entire position since they fundamentally aren't a business with a strong moat and pricing power. The space seems very crowded and in my own personal shopping experience - I almost always use Apple Pay when shopping on mobile and use Shop pay when purchasing online. Looking for a more opportune time to sell it though.\n\n**Canadian Pacific (CP) - 4.5%** \\- I bought this mostly due to railroads having very high barriers to entry and typically having strong moat (they have the only railway spanning USA, Canada and Mexico). This hasn't really translated to much FCF/EPS growth though and the company carries alot of debt. Looking to sell this position when it gets to a better valuation.\n\n**Fluence Energy (FLNC) - 4.3%** \\- I honestly bought into this purely based on technical analysis in 2024 - low market cap, very high revenue growth, large backlog, and enterprise backing. Currently down -55% on it and it\u2019s my only losing position. I really regret buying into this position and want to get rid of it, haven\u2019t had the stomach to just ear my losses and sell yet. Learned my lesson here to evaluate the business instead of the technicals.\n\n**Reddit (RDDT) - 3%** \\- I own this since this is a platform that I use a lot (in addition to Youtube). The financial growth seems very impressive and the business/platform is very good. I\u2019m debating on whether to buy more into it but valuation makes me slightly afraid, though it always seems like great businesses always trade at high valuations and still end up compounding long germ.\n\n**Nebius Group (NBIS) - 2%** \\- Honestly just my gamble stock.\n\n**Remaining <1% are FICO, RIVN, and SNOW.**\n\n  \nCurious to know what everyone thinks and what their feedback is!\n",

I am targeting potentially good candidates for short-term trading; I have no opinion on them as investments. The potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting, everything else is secondary.\n\nNews: [Intel's Ceo Draws Support For Revival From Softbank Trump](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-08-19/intel-s-ceo-draws-support-for-revival-from-softbank-trump?srnd=homepage-americas)\n\n[**INTC (Intel)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=INTC&p=d)\\-SoftBank is buying stock equal to roughly 2% of Intel\u2019s outstanding shares in a $2 billion investment, driving the stock up!! News hit AH yesterday, ultimately interested to see if INTC makes another run at the open and if we can sustain- we've made a massive 6% move already. Despite the bearish news of  US government potentially using CHIPS Act grants to buy equity in the company, SoftBank news seems purely bullish until we get more details. This hasn't moved other semis much (NVDA/AMD unaffected). Thank you Nana!!!\n\n[**OPEN (Open Door)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=OPEN&p=d)\\-Carrie Wheeler resigned as chair and CEO and the board launched a search for her replacement. This has caused the stock to explode from $2.50 -> $4. Again, this has meme stock written all over it. Not too interested in any long-term plays, but interested in seeing if we can break $5 again. Currently short-biased.  Personally, I don't think this can make any kind of sustainable move because it's way too liquid to make any of those epic squeezes we've seen from other companies in the past- illiquidity is what drives the massive moves when people get squeezed. \n\n[**VKTX (Viking Therapeutics)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=VKTX&p=d)\\-Its experimental obesity pill disappointed in a mid-stage study, marking another weaker-than-expected result for an oral alternative to popular weight-loss injections. \"VK2735, helped patients lose up to 12.2% of their body weight. However, roughly 28% of patients dropped out of the trial in just three months, dampening hopes that the pill could compete with treatments from LLY/NVO.\" Had an epic spike to the upside then sold off close to 35%-mainly looking for a bounce in this stock if we reach $25 again.\n\n[**APLD (**Applied Digital Corp**)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=APLD&p=d)\\-Announced they were breaking ground on Polaris Forge 2 - a $3B, 280MW AI factory in North Dakota. Cited \"unprecedented demand for AI compute infrastructure\". Interestingly enough, Sam Altman said yesterday that investors were \"overexcited about AI\".\n\nAnyway, this stock has near doubled in the past 3 months and I'm interested to see if we can hold above $16. Hyperscalers are only viable if there's unrelenting demand and it seems that there isn't any reduction of demand (for now).\n\n**Earnings today:** [**NBIS**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NBIS&p=d)",

    "selftext": "The MI350 is close enough to Nvidia's performance that AMD can finally charge something closer to a premium price. This chip is no longer just an affordable alternative - it's being used in real-world, mission-critical AI workloads. Most importantly, this is the \u201cearly inflection point\u201d in the changing competitive landscape you've been watching.\n\n\n\nRevenue and margin gains are real \n\nAt higher average selling prices, AMD has been able to grow significantly without having to dramatically increase volume. Even the relatively low volume of the MI350 ($25K) is likely to boost Q3 and Q4 results, especially considering that they will be compared to a period when China's exports were hit hard. Margins could also improve: shifting more of the GPU portfolio to higher-end SKUs will help close AMD's earnings gap with Nvidia and Broadcom - which still limits AMD's P/E ratio.\n\n\n\nThe market expects AMD's GPU revenue to be around $1.65 billion in the third quarter. If MI355X grows as expected in the second half of the year and prices move in line with expectations, AMD's revenue could be revised upward.\n\n\n\nMajor customers could be behind this move \n\nAMD wouldn't be pressing prices so aggressively unless major cloud service providers such as Meta ( META ) and Oracle ( ORCL ) were on board. There is growing evidence that these customers are no longer just interested in AMD's GPUs, but are actually actively deploying them. We saw early signs of this in our Q1 earnings call and earnings filings. Customers appear to be buying AMD's complete AI platform, including ROCm, system integration and long-term support.\n\n\n\nAMD vs. Nvidia: The Price Gap is Narrowing \n\nEven at $25K, the MI350 is less expensive than Nvidia's B200, making AMD an attractive choice for workloads such as inference, especially among enterprises and second-tier cloud service providers that can't justify Nvidia's pricing. This creates an optimal balance of \u201cvalue and performance,\u201d and AMD is helping to lead the way in certain market segments. This marks a significant shift in the competitive landscape.\n\n\n\nRisks remain, but the narrative is changing \n\nHeadwinds remain. China's export restrictions could result in a revenue reduction of \\~$800 million in the second half of 2025, and it is unclear if or when licenses will resume. mi355x needs to be released smoothly and continue the momentum of mi350 - any issues with the software or system will be closely watched. rocm is still lagging behind CUDA in developer adoption. Still lagging behind CUDA in terms of adoption, but improving: ROCm now offers day one support for LLaMA 4 and there are over 2 million models optimized for AMD GPUs on Hugging Face.\n\n\n\nOverall \n\nThis indicates a shift in AMD's strategy. It supports our broader view that the company is no longer confined to the role of low-cost alternative, but is moving towards leadership in AI computing. If these pricing trends continue - and especially if they trigger even a modest \u201cahead-of-the-curve\u201d cycle - the market may begin to reassess AMD as less of a traditional chipmaker and more of a AMD as less of a traditional chipmaker and more of a platform company. As these fundamentals strengthen, the technological breakthroughs we've seen from AMD, especially relative to NVIDIA, could begin to gain real staying power.",

    "title": "Absolutely everything you need to know about AMZN earnings today",
    "selftext": "Okay guys, so Amazon is set to release its Q2 earnings after the market closes today with an analyst call at 5 pm. This is gonna be a big one. Did anyone catch META yesterday? Fuck. \n\nFor Amazon, analysts expect revenue around $162 billion (up 10%) and EPS between $1.32 and $1.33, with operating income projected at $16.7 to $16.87 billion. And during this sesh, the key areas to watch will include AWS growth (estimated at $30.77 billion, up 17%), AI investments (over $100 billion capex planned), and advertising revenue (up 17% to $14.99 billion). Considering the stock performance, it's up 5% year-to-date, with bullish analyst sentiments (e.g., UBS raised price target to $271), but some valuation concerns exist (GF Value at $189.47). External factors like tariffs and Prime Day success could influence outcomes, with potential for significant stock movement based on guidance. I know that people are going to be playing AMZN earnings so I wanted to do a little write up for /r/Stocks so you guys are well informed. And I'll even post what I plan on getting at the end. \n\n**Analyst Expectations and Financial Projections**\n\nAnalysts have provided a range of estimates for Amazon's Q2 performance, showing a lot of optimism. \n\nRevenue: Expected to be around $162 billion, with variations such as $162.1 billion and $162.19 billion, representing a 9.5% to 10% year-over-year increase.  \n\nEarnings Per Share (EPS): Forecasted at $1.32 to $1.33, up from $1.26 last year, with Amazon having beaten EPS estimates for nine consecutive quarters.  \n\nOperating Income: Projected between $16.7 billion and $16.87 billion, a 13.8% to 15% increase, with an operating margin expected at 10.6% (up from 9.9% last year).  \n\nThese projections suggest strong growth, and I honestly think Amazon can exceed these figures and provide robust forward guidance. Especially given its historical \"beat and raise\" pattern, which may not suffice in the current up cycle.\n\n**Key Business Segments and Growth Drivers**\n\nAmazon's diverse operations are expected to drive its Q2 results, with several segments highlighted as critical:  \n\n1) AWS (Amazon Web Services)  \n\nAWS remains a cornerstone of Amazon's profitability, with Q1 2025 revenue up 17% to $29.3 billion. For Q2, net sales are estimated at $30.77 billion, with growth of 17% excluding foreign exchange effects. However, operating margins are expected to drop to 35% due to significant investments in AI and infrastructure, part of a $100+ billion capex plan for 2025. This segment contributed 17% of revenue and 58% of operating income last year, making it a focal point for me.\n\n2) Advertising Revenue  \n\nAdvertising is another growth engine, with Q1 2025 revenue up 18%. For Q2, it's projected to rise 17% to $14.99 billion, reflecting increased monetization of Amazon's platform as more businesses leverage its advertising ecosystem.\n\n3) Prime Membership  \n\nPrime membership grew 9% year-over-year to 220 million globally, providing a stable revenue stream through subscription fees. This growth, driven by benefits like free shipping and streaming, is expected to continue supporting Amazon's financials.\n\n4) Operational Efficiency  \n\nAmazon has improved operational efficiency, reducing fulfillment costs and increasing delivery speeds, which should enhance margins. These efforts are part of a broader strategy to balance growth investments with profitability.\n\n5) Investments in AI and Other Areas  \n\nAmazon's commitment to AI is a major theme, with a $100+ billion capital expenditure plan for 2025, primarily focused on AWS and AI services. This includes developing proprietary chips like Trainium2 and partnering with Nvidia to enhance AI capabilities. While these investments may pressure short-term margins, they position Amazon for long-term growth in the expanding AI market. Additionally, Project Kuiper, a satellite initiative, is noted as an area of rising expense, alongside e-commerce and content/advertising investments.\n\n**Analyst sentiments are generally bullish**\n\nUBS raised its price target from $249 to $271, calling Amazon the \"most coiled\" Big Tech name, implying an 18% upside and highlighting extensive investments across e-commerce, AWS, content/advertising, and Kuiper. Other analysts, including Wedbush, William Blair, and Stifel, reiterated \"outperform\" or \"buy\" ratings, with an average price target of $252.66 (range: $195 to $305). \n\n**External Factors and Market Context**\n\nSeveral external factors could influence Amazon's earnings and stock reaction:  \n\nConsider the Tariffs. Earlier this year, tariff concerns, particularly on Chinese goods, weighed on the stock, but recovery followed eased U.S. tariffs. Analysts are parsing impacts on e-commerce, with Amazon benefiting from stockpiling ahead of potential tariff hikes.\n\nAlso, think about the Prime Day Success. Held in July, Prime Day's performance could lift revenue guidance for the September-ending quarter, providing a positive signal for us.  \n\nAnd finally, with any earnings post, we need to consider macroeconomic events such as inflation, interest rates, and consumer spending trends could affect retail sales, particularly in online stores and third-party seller revenue, expected to grow 6.5% to $58.99 billion and 7% to $38.74 billion, respectively.\n\n**Potential Catalysts**\n\nI'm expecting accelerating AWS growth, better-than-expected margins, new AI announcements, and strong Q3 guidance. UBS expects upward revisions to operating profit and free-cash-flow as revenue grows, potentially more dramatic than peers.  \n\n\n**Comparisons**\n\nMicrosoft's recent Q2 results, where cloud growth was a significant driver, boosts my confidence in Amazon's cloud business, with MSFT stock jumping 4.47% in after-hours trading. This really does show how important AWS performance will be, as Amazon faces a high bar following Microsoft's strong showing.\n\n**So what to do?**\n\nAmazon's Q2 earnings are poised to be a major event, with strong growth expected across key segments like AWS, advertising, and Prime, supported by significant AI investments. This will be a great opportunity to get a call spread. For those who don't know anything about option trading, you don't need to continue reading. But for those who do, I'll be buying the 8/1 245c (@ 2.67) and selling the 252.5c (@ 1.11). This means I can get the spread for $156, with a potential max gain of 4.8x if AMZN can go up about 7.8% with earnings. Considering the stock moves on average about \u00b18% with earnings, there's a good chance it'll go up 4-8% today. \n\nNext week tho, we have a ton more earnings so I think I'll be doing a post on PLTR and AMD.",

    "selftext": "I think that AMD's release of the MI350 series of GPUs will give them a significant presence in the market for the following main reasons. First of all, the performance metrics I mentioned earlier put it on par with Nvidia in terms of hardware. Considering Nvidia's staggering GPU margins, AMD could offer a similar product at a much lower price to grab market share. In fact, there are reports that AMD has plans to raise prices, which one would guess indicates strong demand for its MI350 series.\n\n\n\nWhile data center expansions may not have been worth it for developers in the past, hundreds of billions of dollars are currently being poured into GPUs for AI. Saving even a fraction of that would incentivize companies and their developers to use AMD's open-source ROCm platform instead of CUDA. in short, the GPU market is much larger than it used to be due to the demand for AI, and that changes the economics. In the past, it may not have been worth a developer's time to add a new server stack, but when building entirely new data centers specifically for AI, it makes sense to figure these things out if you can save even 10%.\n\n\n\nAdditionally, the AI market needs GPU resources both for training to build models and for inference to apply those models to solve problems in real-world scenarios. In the early days of the AI boom, training required more resources, or at least about half of each. In the future, reasoning resources are expected to grow faster than training resources. Fortunately (or more likely by design), products such as AMD's MI350 excel at inference and are on par with the Blackwell family. Here's how much AMD expects AI usage to continue to grow, with breakthroughs in training and inference",

Here\u2019s how I see it: AI needs constant computational and electrical power. Not just for the data centers and the fabs that make the chips, but the chips themselves burn power 24/7. The more models scale, the more energy they eat. That power has to come from somewhere. Big tech ceos are already talking about potential future power shortages if we dont come up with something better than what we have rn\nSo here\u2019s how I\u2019m thinking about it:\nWe started with AI companies throwing money at chip companies \u2192chip companies throwing money at fabs like TSMC \u2192fabs and AI centers pulling insane amounts of power off the grid \u2192and now we\u2019re about to see power companies (especially nuclear) get flooded with cash \u2192and that means the uranium miners feeding those reactors are next in line.\nThis is how i see the chain:\nAI companies \u2192 NVDA / AMD / INTC \u2192 TSMC / Samsung \u2192 SMRs like Oklo / SMR / TerraPower \u2192 uranium miners like UUUU / NXE / CCJ.\nEvery stage up the chain got paid. The last ones left to run are nuclear and uranium.\nI think we\u2019re about to see a repeat of the same pattern within the next few years as we experience energy shortage. Just like how NVDA and AMD dominated chips, I think a couple players will dominate nuclear. Right now we\u2019ve got:\n* Oklo (backed by Sam Altman, just IPO\u2019d $10.5B)\n* NuScale / SMR (~$6.8B)\n* TerraPower (still private but Gates-backed and getting a ton of attention)\nThat\u2019s probably the big 3. Others will show up, but like everything else, a couple names are going to take 80% of the market and leave everyone else behind.\nSame goes for uranium. CCJ is the king, but NXE and UUUU are getting attention. Supply is tight, and if nuclear demand explodes, miners get squeezed upward just like GPU demand squeezed NVDA.\nSo yeah, are Oklo / SMR / TerraPower are the next NVDA / AMD / INTC  just further up the chain? The ones getting paid by the ones getting paid.\nI\u2019m looking at LEAP calls and they are not that expensive while they\u2019re still under the radar. It\u2019s the last piece of the AI/infrastructure puzzle that hasn\u2019t run yet.\nWhat do you guys think? Am I early? I just dropped a few grand on $UUUU and OKLO july 2026 calls so Im seaking guidance from fellow degenerates. Also I know were still years ahead of nuclear, but I have a big FOMO\u2026",

Does this change the outlook for AMD, Intel, or even TSMC longer term? Or is it just a nice talking point that won\u2019t really move the needle financially?",

    "selftext": "ZF Su has done a remarkable job at AMD, taking it from a struggling company to a company that now has a market capitalization that surpasses Intel's and is well ahead of NVIDIA's. This is not the first time that AMD has been at a disadvantage. This isn't the first time AMD has been at a disadvantage, and it's highly unlikely that AMD will overtake NVIDIA in market capitalization in the next few years, but the gap is certainly closing. Over the past year, AMD has been dubbed a \u201csenior money destroyer\u201d by investors as Wall Street analysts' price targets have fallen along with AMD's stock price, but that's now reversing. Market optimism, AMD's win over NVIDIA in AI inference, its partnership with the Middle East, and OpenAI's favoring of AMD GPUs have led to a rebound in the stock and Wall Street has raised its price target. Global investment in AI infrastructure is only going to increase, with McKinsey estimating that by 2030 the figure will be as high as $7 trillion. AI reasoning is essential during this tech boom. If AMD introduces a better product for this specific element in its GPUs, AMD will significantly close the gap as customers will want AMD GPUs for inference rather than training.\n\nAMD is positioning itself for the future in the inference space rather than competing with NVIDIA in the training space now. The improvements they proposed in their recent AI keynote, as well as OpenAI's adoption of the MI400X, are very optimistic for AMD as growth soars with the lifting of restrictions in China.",

    "selftext": "I posted a couple days ago expressing my view that money can be made by being on top of trump's agenda, policy-related news, etc. I'm not saying its easy, but I think in several instances so far this year, the \"puzzle pieces\" have been out there, and if you put them together, you could have positioned ahead of the news. MP was one i mentioned in my previous post but there have been others.\n\nTo get to the point... There is an \"AI Action Day\" event happening on Wednesday. Hosted by All-In podcast people (David Sachs) and with various tech leaders in attendance as well as Trump of course.  Supposedly this will be an announcement of a larger strategy to promote US AI dominance. I would bet that there are opportunities here. Not clear if there is a home run, but I think a smart person could figure out a smart way to play this.\n\nUnfortunately, I'm not a smart person, but maybe collectively as a group of not-smart people, we can figure out some plays here.\n\nI can't link sources for some reason, keeps deleting my post, but you guys can google more information regarding the event if you want. TLDR It's being hosted\n\nTechnology leaders participating in the event include **Chris Power, CEO of Hadrian**; **Shyam Sankar, CTO of Palantir**; **Paul Buchheit, Partner at YCombinator; James Litinsky, CEO of MP Materials; Lisa Su, CEO of AMD.**\n\nAdditional speakers are still being confirmed.\n\nI don't think the obvious choices are going to move much here. NVDA is already up significantly and i don't expect any announcements big enough to move a 4 trillion market cap... The easing of chip restrictions is also already priced in now. I expected this will be touched on at the event, but it's no longer news.\n\nSpitballing but a few ideas:\n\nI think energy will be a major focus of any strategy announcement. This is an area that is critically important for AI, and an area where the US is SIGNIFICANTLY lagging China. I'm not too sure how this could be played, but I'm considering EQT. I was looking at them last week due to the PA AI event. The stock didn't move much unfortunately, but all of nat gas seems to have struggled to close the week for whatever reason. By no means an expert here, but EQT has a major grift angle in that their CEO is closely tied to the republican party/trump.\n\nDatacenter buildout: PWR, ACM, FLR - not really sure here. Chatgpt helped me on this one. Maybe APLD? Could be some type of policy/tax incentive to stimulate datacenter construction. not that its really needed at this point...\n\nI'm really just spitballing and hoping to start some conversation here.",

    "title": "Nvidia Will Continue Controlling The AI Board",
    "selftext": "Nvidia is the 'queen' of the AI ecosystem, dominating hardware, software, and systems and controlling key segments from training to inference and networking.\n\nUnmatched AI leadership, explosive revenue growth, and strategic partnerships with players like Astera Labs, Credo, and Super Micro Computer reinforce Nvidia's central role.\n\nChina market access and the Omniverse platform provide significant new growth drivers, supporting a strong 12-24 month growth outlook and a buy rating.\n\nDespite high absolute valuation multiples, Nvidia's rapid growth and favorable PEG ratios make it attractive versus peers; the main risk is US-China geopolitical tension.\n\nI believe these companies are well-positioned in the AI ecosystem, but I realise that one piece is missing: the queen. Just like in a game of chess, the queen is the most powerful and versatile piece on the board. It can move in any direction (horizontal, vertical, and diagonal) and quickly cover a wide area. That is why I believe it is a perfect fit for NVIDIA (NVDA). I say this because it dominates both offensively and defensively. Just as the queen controls most of the board, NVDA controls the most valuable parts of the AI infrastructure, from training to inference, simulation, and networking. Secondly, it is versatile and critical because it spans hardware, software, and systems. This is cool because few participants can match its breadth and influence. Finally, it leverages strategic partnerships. I mean, just as the queen commands pawns, rooks, and bishops, NVDA integrates system builders (such as Super Micro Computer (SMCI)), connectivity providers (such as Credo Technology Group (CRDO) and Astera Labs (ALAB)), and government AI programmes to expand its control over the AI battlefield.\n\nSo why is the queen so special?\n\nWell, several factors set Nvidia apart. First and foremost, it holds an unparalleled leadership position in the AI field, thanks to the combination of hardware, software, and ecosystem advantages. Its Blackwell GPU architecture makes it uniquely special. Combined with the Omniverse simulation platform, we are driving self-reinforcing AI, which is driving explosive growth. For example, in the first quarter of the 2026 fiscal year, NVDA achieved revenue of $44.1 billion, representing a year over year increase of 69%. Data centre revenue reached $39.1 billion, up 73%. Some of Nvidia's key customers such as Microsoft , Google  OpenAI, and Meta  deploy tens of thousands of Nvidia's latest GPUs each quarter. For example, according to SA Weebler Finance data, hyperscale data centre operators are running approximately 1,000 NVLink rack systems (about 72,000 GPUs) per week, with further increases expected. Ideally, this means Nvidia's data centre run rate in the AI computing sector has exceeded $170 billion annually.\n\nSecondly, NVDA's stack is also expanding beyond GPUs. As I mentioned, its global industrial simulation platform is now being used to digitise entire factories and cities. In fact, the platform has evolved to support critical infrastructure. Original equipment manufacturers like BMW are running over 30 virtual factories on the platform to optimise production in advance. As each AI solution requires an increasing amount of synthetic training data, NVDA's end-to-end solutions form an unparalleled moat. Ideally, this platform means more users generating more simulation data, ultimately driving demand for more Nvidia computing resources. What I see is that NVDA is now at the centre of the AI value chain.\n\nFinally, the U.S. has approved the resumption of exports of NVIDIA H20 AI GPUs to China. This means NVIDIA will be able to access China's potential market, which is significant. According to a Morgan Stanley report, China's AI market is expected to reach $1.4 trillion by 2030.\n\nChina has been systematically implementing a long-term strategy to build its domestic artificial intelligence capabilities. Its strong academic foundation, innovative methods, data, talent, and growing foreign investment are driving it toward becoming a leading artificial intelligence powerhouse...\n\n\u2018...China is less concerned with building the most powerful AI capabilities and more focused on bringing AI to market. China embraces open-source AI, while the United States appears to be moving toward closed, tightly controlled AI systems...\u2019\n\n\u2018...The next 6 to 12 months will be a critical period for Chinese AI companies, as more and more deployments aimed at solving real-world problems begin to demonstrate productivity gains.\u2019\n\nDue to this milestone, NVDA's Jensen Huang estimates that NVDA's potential market size  in China will reach $50 billion. This means that China's spending on AI will increase, and Nvidia's growth prospects are expected to be stronger than ever before. I expect this growth outlook to be reflected in the upcoming quarterly earnings report to be released on 27 August 2025.\n\nThese factors combined will undoubtedly accelerate Nvidia's growth trajectory over the next 12 to 24 months. Therefore, I assign a \u2018Buy\u2019 rating to Nvidia Corporation.\n\nNvidia's AI Ecosystem\n\nHaving highlighted the case for NVDA, I would like to connect it to some AI components I have researched previously. Some of these AI companies have remarkable growth prospects and are expected to align their growth trajectories with NVDA. Additionally, the connections between NVDA and these AI companies will help us better understand NVDA's future direction.\n\nFirst, Astera Labs  is a leading connectivity chip company that recently went public in 2024. ALAB's chips support scalable and low-latency GPU rack interconnects. For more information on Astera Labs and its chips, please refer to Article 1 and Article 2. Now, Nvidia has publicly announced its collaboration with Astera on NVLink Fusion. This collaboration expands NVDA's total addressable market (TAM).\n\nThere is also Credo Technology, which is known for its active cables  re-timers, and SerDes chips. According to SA Oakoff Investments, most hyperscale computing vendors now consider CRDO's AEC to be the de facto standard for in-rack links. This means that AEC cables are the infrastructure required for NVDA's 72-GPU Blackwell rack.\n\nThird, Super Micro Computer  and Celestica  manufacture and sell GPU racks and systems using NVDA technology. Nvidia currently provides complete data centre racks containing tens of thousands of GPUs, which are delivered to system builders like SMCI and CLS. They then collaborate with NVDA to package and sell these racks to hyperscale customers such as Microsoft, Meta, and Amazon. For more information, please refer to this article from SMCI and this article from Celestica.\n\nIn summary, these partnerships demonstrate NVIDIA's connectivity within the AI ecosystem. This confirms that NVIDIA is indeed the queen of the AI chessboard.\n\nFor a company with a market capitalisation of 4.22 trillion dollars, it still has significant growth opportunities, particularly in the Chinese market, which means there is much to watch for with NVIDIA. Additionally, I note that NVIDIA has an A- growth rating, as shown in the figure below. The company's expected revenue growth rate is 60.71%, while the industry median is 7.28%. Furthermore, its 3-5 year compound annual growth rate  for expected long-term earnings per share  growth is 29.09%, compared to the industry median of 14.29%. This clearly indicates the expected growth levels for certain potential AI opportunities, such as the Omniverse platform and the Chinese AI market.\n\nNow, when it comes to valuation, the growth outlook is becoming clearer. First, when I look at the chart below, I notice that most metrics are above the industry median, indicating that the valuation is higher than the industry median. Its non-GAAP forward price-to-earnings ratio is 40.12 times, and its forward enterprise value to EBITDA ratio is 34.79 times, both significantly higher than the industry median. However, when I look at the non-GAAP forward price-to-earnings ratio , it indicates that the valuation is undervalued by 27%. NVDA's price-to-earnings ratio is 1.38 times, while the industry median is 1.90 times. Based on the GAAP trailing 12-month PEG, the company's P/E ratio is 0.69 times, undervalued by 31% compared to the industry median. Ideally, I would say that most multiples look high in absolute terms, but compared to NVDA's 60.71% compound annual growth rate, the stock's valuation isn't as high as it appears.\n\nIn terms of peer comparison, I chose NVDA's closest competitors because Nvidia is already far ahead in terms of market capitalisation, so I chose Broadcom and AMD. I noticed that NVDA's price-to-earnings ratio and expected price-to-earnings ratio are still lower than its peers.\n\nI believe that the biggest risk facing NVIDIA at present is geopolitical risk. Currently, there are many uncertainties between China and the United States, especially following the imposition of tariffs on Liberation Day and the U.S. government's decision to suspend exports of H20 GPUs to China. Such situations could recur and undermine NVIDIA's growth plans and market expansion efforts. Losing the Chinese market would have a significant impact on NVIDIA's business. Additionally, geopolitical events such as trade tariffs and sanctions could affect global supply or cloud computing spending in some of the key regions where NVIDIA operates. In conclusion, in this grand AI infrastructure game, NVIDIA is the queen. Currently, it is the most powerful and flexible piece on the board. Compared to peers that may occupy other key positions, NVIDIA controls every direction. For example, AMD is the rook, SMCI is the bishop, while Credo and Astera are agile knights. Ultimately, NVIDIA determines the pace and scope of this game. As AI demand continues to grow, NVIDIA's dominant position is further strengthened by the expansion of the Chinese market.",

Graphics and gaming is a minor market for them, and companies like AMD can provide better gaming GPU cards for less money. So let's talk about the AI - because then you have companies like Intel and AMD, and Google with their own TPUs and then you have China which is according to various sources maybe about 2 - 5 years behind, but ultimately trying to be able to both design and manufacture such chips too.\n\nSo:\n\nnvidia - valued at 4.2T capable only of designing powerful compute chips, being currently most popular by AI researchers because their CUDA software stack is already widely adopted and mature\n\nIntel - valued at \\~100B capable of **both designing and manufacturing** comparably powerful compute chips - not having so mature ecosystem as CUDA - yet  \nAMD - valued at \\~250B capable of only designing compute chips just as powerful as nvidia, only lacking in adoption of their software stack (ROCm) that they keep improving (they already provide accelerators cards even more powerful than nvidia)\n\nTSMC - valued at 1.2T which is manufacturing for most of chip designers, now including even Intel (partially) that nvidia is totally dependent on\n\nThen you have companies like Google and Cerebras that design their own silicon (again depending on TSMC just as everyone else, maybe except Chinese) that make chips far more powerful than nvidia does.\n\nSo where is this insane valuation of nvidia coming from? Is it just because they have a temporary leading edge in industry that just seems to be a top of all hype?\n\nBecause in few years they could literally become irrelevant in the AI world just as Nokia became irrelevant in the mobile phone world - the competition exists, has similar products, and it's only a matter of short time until software stacks for Intel and AMD GPUs get as much adopted in LLM / AI world as CUDA is.\n\nCan someone help me understand this valuation?",

This reopens a major demand pipeline and removes a significant geopolitical overhang, boosting investor sentiment around long-term growth prospects. NVDA has hit ATH from this, I'm more interested in AMD today as a trade though just because it's run down compared to NVDA, but I'm interested in seeing if NVDA can break $170. The export clearance marks a shift in U.S. posture toward China and semiconductors and the AI race, suggesting trade tensions are entering a more flexible phase and all that money Jensen \"donated\" to Trump is paying off.

    "selftext": "AMD started FY 2025 on a strong foot, and I expect strong double-digit growth for the full fiscal year. In the Data Center segment, the company reported 57% year-over-year growth in the first quarter. The growth was mostly fueled by the expanding EPYC CPU deployments. I am optimistic that such growth momentum can be sustained thanks to its partnerships with hyperscalers and enterprise customers. In addition, with the new platforms and ROCm software advances reported in the ER, I see AMD\u2019s position in the AI infrastructure space further reinforced.\n\nIn other segments, I see encouraging developments too, in particular in terms of AI-related offerings. For instance, the Client segment reported a 68% YOY revenue increase in Q1. The key drivers include strong desktop and notebook demand, higher ASPs, and growing traction in commercial PCs with Ryzen AI chips. In the Embedded system, I see demand gradually improving and believe the new edge AI offerings (such as the EPYC Embedded 9005 and Versal AI Edge) as key drivers.",

On Monday, analysts from Morgan Stanley said in a research note that potential usage of Google's chips for inferencing OpenAI's AI workloads would have been a significant endorsement of Google's hardware.\n\nOver the weekend, it was reported that OpenAI has started using Google-made AI chips to build its products. However, it was noted that Google was not providing the most powerful TPUs to OpenAI, signaling its plans to use its most advanced versions to power the company's internal projects, including its own large language model Gemini.\n\nLast month, OpenAI, reportedly, signed a deal with Google Cloud for the AI company's computing needs.",

    "selftext": "I know when a company is at a bargain to buy. Problem is, I know when to buy, but I don\u2019t know when to sell. Do I sell when I need the money or when doctor tells me I only got a month to live? \n\nLet me give you several examples:\n\nI was able to buy lots of Celsius stocks at $8 basis in 2020 when I began trying their drinks, enjoyed it and began seeing Celsius drinks sold everywhere at grocery markets and convenience stores. I felt confident. Celsius rose all the way to $95, the stock split and dropped all the way back to $25. Obviously, I did not sell any.\n\nSame thing applies to FSLY, SQ, SE when I did not sell at the peak and watched them drop all the way back to my entry price then I panic sold and only secured a very little gain.\n\nSMCI - I also panic sold at $23.81 for small gain and obviously, watching the price going back up is lots of pain. \n\nI was able to buy lots of crowdstrike last year in July when the outage caused chaos within airport and various companies. I also scooped some UNH as well due to recent (to me, it\u2019s overreaction) free fall. \n\nI bought lots of ASTS at $11 and sold at $30 to get my entry money back. Then it went all the way to $46. \n\nLots of people say, if a stock gives you 25% to 50%, it makes sense for you to sell all, take the profit and run. It\u2019s not true at all. If you sold NVDA, TSLA, AMD and PLTR at 30% gain, you probably cried yourself to sleep every night. Some of the companies do have ten-fold potential if you decide to hold long. And selling them also subject yourself to short term capital gain tax. \n\nAlso, PLTR PE ratio skyrockets. I understand military contract and AI reliance are legit, but there\u2019s no guarantee for price to hold. When is a good time to sell? Which companies have bright future to hold strong despite free fall? Nobody has a crystal ball I understand but does reading business financial statement and learning their fundamental/ business model/ ecological system gives you a clue? \n\nMarket is at ATH carried by major techs due to AI replacing humans leading to boost in company\u2019s profit margin and future earning potential. But correction will eventually come. \n\nI need investing veterans to give me some guidances here? Appreciate it!! \n\nWarren Buffett once said \u201cselling fine businesses on scary news is usually a bad decision\u201d ",

I've also added the Franklin FTSE India ETF (10%) to capture long-term growth potential in emerging markets, particularly India. In addition, I've chosen a cybersecurity ETF (RIZE CYBR) (10%) to position myself in a sector that's increasingly critical, and I\u2019ve added a biotech ETF along with Moderna(15%)to diversify into healthcare innovation.\n\nBesides this USD portfolio, I hold 10,000 euros in the Vanguard Global Stock Index Fund.

I know \"time in the market > timing in the market\" but do you think it is a good week/month to enter? Nvidia for example is super high right now. \n\n4. If you hold for 10 years, but there's a big loss on year 10. Does that mean all those 9 years have been useless and you gotta start again? \n\n  \nSorry if the questions are too noob and thankyou for the feedback. ",

    "title": "As Intel exits the trough of the semiconductor cycle, does AMD still have hope? Twice as many assets as AMD is the biggest advantage.",
    "selftext": "# As Intel exits the trough of the semiconductor cycle, does AMD still have hope? Twice as many assets as AMD is the biggest advantage.\n\n**Undervalued giant vs. overhyped challenger**\n\n\n\nIn 2024, when INTEL released its third-quarter earnings report, its stock price collapsed. Countless AMD fans cheered, various remarks continued in X SPACE, and mainstream media began to relay such as\n\n>\\* INTEL is going to die, stupid guys actually have their own factories and workers.\n\n>\\* They should learn from AMD, don't need to have anything, light assets are right. AMD YES!\n\n>\\* In the German market, 99% of shipments are AMD and only 1% are INTEL. INTEL is dead.\n\n>\\* The coachman and driver in the steam engine era, no company should be eliminated more than INTEL, and INTEL actually has a factory, which is a shame for the United States.\n\n>\\* Look at what Apple does, they only do design, wake up, the United States does not need factories.\n\n>\\* AMD has been on a roll in recent years. Once seen as the underdog, it is now worth nearly twice as much as Intel\u2014and Intel has twice as many assets, its own fabs, a global supply chain, and arguably the most strategic position in U.S. semiconductor security.\n\nI have asked these people a question more than once: how to understand the semiconductor cycle? Do chip manufacturers really not need the entire industry chain? Taking a step back, INTEL is the real domestic chip security in the United States. And what it gets is always endless ridicule.\n\nBut is this shift entirely justified? Or is it a reflection of market sentiment, AI hype, and short-term memory?\n\nI have worked as an IT technical consultant in the manufacturing industry, and I still have a good understanding of production. I know very well that owning a factory will be a heavy burden, which will lead to a longer cycle and profit encroachment, but the advantage is that once you pass the trough, your own production capacity will be a nuclear-powered money printing machine.\n\nAnd based on China's experience, the security brought by own factories is far greater than outsourcing.\n\nI deeply remember what the former CEO of INTEL said, \"We added AI chips and AI computing to the motherboard, but we don't know what it can do. This is what the application layer does.\" INTEL's dilemma is actually the same as Apple's. They are honest people in the industry. They tell the truth, and capital does not need the truth.There are countless AI enthusiasts, non-IT personnel, and AI vested interests. They will infinitely exaggerate AI, even if it is like science fiction. But no one cares, because this is what capital needs.\n\n **The myth that \u201cbigger is not better\u201d**\n\nIntel is one of the few companies in the world with full-stack semiconductor capabilities\u2014from x86 architecture design to advanced process nodes, packaging, foundry services, and global distribution. Although costly, its fixed assets provide the United States and its allies with protection against geopolitical risks and long-term strategic autonomy.\n\n\n\nIn contrast, AMD adopts a fabless model\u2014lean, capital-efficient, and agile. But it also means AMD is heavily dependent on TSMC, a potential single point of failure. In times of peace and profitability, this may seem like an advantage. But in times of turmoil, this may not be the case.\n\n\n\nWhile the market currently rewards asset-light models with higher P/E ratios, one can't help but ask: What is the intrinsic value of resilience, control, and national independence in the post-globalization era?\n\n\n\n **Intel's decline is real - but so is its reconstruction**\n\nLet's be honest: Intel has made mistakes. Delays in 10nm, missed opportunities in mobile, and a slow transition to AI have damaged its credibility. Investors have lost patience.\n\n\n\nBut Intel today is not the Intel of 2018. Under CEO Pat Gelsinger, the company:\n\n\n\nIntroduced Intel 3G and 18A nodes ahead of schedule\n\n\n\nOpened its fabs (Intel foundries) to external customers\n\n\n\nGetted strong support through the CHIPS Act\n\n\n\nEntered AI accelerator market with Gaudi series chips\n\n\n\nWorked on IDM 2.0 strategy to regain manufacturing leadership\n\n\n\nThese are not promises on paper - they are capital-intensive, multi-year initiatives. If executed well, these initiatives may turn Intel from a \"value trap\" to a \"growth surprise\".\n\n\n\n **AMD: A great company, but is the hype sustainable?**\n\n\n\nTo be clear, AMD is a phenomenal success story. Lisa Su's leadership is a textbook case. Ryzen and EPYC have disrupted Intel's dominance in the consumer and data center markets. MI300X has now positioned AMD as the second-largest player in AI acceleration - second only to NVIDIA.\n\n\n\nHowever, AMD's stock price currently reflects its perfect execution in the extremely competitive AI market. Investors are betting that AMD will:\n\n\n\nSustain double-digit growth in the post-AI bubble era\n\n\n\nContinue to take market share from Intel and NVIDIA\n\n\n\nDeal with growing competition from internal accelerators (AWS, Google, Meta)\n\n\n\nThis won\u2019t be easy.\n\n\n\n**AI: A bursting bubble?**\n\n\n\nA large part of AMD\u2019s current valuation stems from the AI \u200b\u200bhype cycle. But problems are emerging:\n\n\n\nAI capex at hyperscalers is slowing\n\n\n\nTech giants are developing their own chips, reducing their reliance on AMD/NVIDIA\n\n\n\nMany AI startups that received funding in 2021-2023 are now working to monetize their models\n\n\n\nIf AI enters the \u201cnormalization phase,\u201d the outsized expectations associated with AMD may come under pressure. Meanwhile, Intel\u2014whose stock price already reflects pessimism\u2014has less to lose and more to gain.\n\n\n\n**Strategic value: Intel is more than a company\u2014it\u2019s infrastructure**\n\n\n\nIntel is more than a chipmaker. It\u2019s the backbone of America\u2019s technological sovereignty.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s the only US company with cutting-edge node ambitions\n\n\n\nIt provides CPUs for defense, aviation, infrastructure, and edge computing\n\n\n\nIts survival is seen as a national interest\n\n\n\nWhile this doesn\u2019t guarantee profits, it guarantees protection. Intel\u2019s valuation has a floor \u2014 and, when the cycle turns, its ceiling could be much higher than its current valuation.\n\n\n\n**Valuation Snapshot: 2025 (as of May)**\n\n\n\nMetrics: Intel AMD\n\nMarket Cap \\~$130B \\~$260B\n\nTotal Assets \\~$190B \\~$70B\n\nExpected P/E \\~33x \\~45x\n\nR&D Spending (TTM) \\~$17B \\~$6B\n\nRevenue (TTM) \\~$55B \\~$23B\n\n\n\nIf the semiconductor cycle turns, as it has historically, and Intel\u2019s foundry and AI businesses are able to succeed, this valuation gap may seem absurd in hindsight.\n\n\n\n**Bottom line: $18 is too cheap, but $38 isn\u2019t too expensive**\n\nIntel\u2019s 2022-2023 collapse was painful but also cleansing. Now it stands on the brink of a new chapter \u2014 AI, independent foundry, and a return to competitive execution.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, AMD, while still great, may have peaked in its narrative power.\n\n\n\nSo the question remains:\n\n\n\nWhen the cycle turns, will Intel \u2014 the undervalued giant \u2014 make a strong comeback? And if so, where will AMD go when the music stops?",

    "title": "What a UAE Deal Might Mean For SMCI",
    "selftext": "This has been a pretty eventful week for SMCI and the AI sector as a whole. the acquisition of a [$20 billion deal](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/saudis-datavolt-signs-20bn-deal-with-supermicro/) with DataVolt in Saudi Arabia and a 39% jump in share price off the strength of the news and overall AI sentiment improving is enough to make any degen hard as solid veiny diamonds. One thing this week that has especially caught my eye is UAE's plan to construct a [5GW AI Campus](https://www.commerce.gov/news/press-releases/2025/05/uae-and-us-presidents-attend-unveiling-phase-1-new-5gw-ai-campus-abu), with the help of G42, that will house 5GW worth of data center racks and span **10 square miles**.\n\nTo put this into perspective, thats:\n\n* 50k 100kW full-scale liquid-cooled racks\n* 3.2 **million** Nvidia Blackwell (B100) chips\n* More power than NYC and San Francisco **combined**\n* Equivalent to powering **3-4 million** homes or running **50 million** gaming PCs at full power 24/7\n\nAs you can see, this is an insanely ambitious feat the UAE is trying to achieve. Nonetheless, I couldn't help but ask myself, of the roughly 50k racks the UAE plans to procure, how many of those racks will be SMCI? Furthermore, whatever amount of racks SMCI does provide, how much money does SMCI stand to make from the project? Most importantly, What does that mean for the share price?\n\nFirst, we need to understand what DCBBS is, and how it actually benefits customers with large scale projects like the UAE AI Campus.\n\nDCBBS stands for **Direct Connect Backplane Building Block Solutions**, and it\u2019s SMCI's proprietary system architecture for building **full AI racks,** not just individual servers. This means when a customer selects which AI rack configuration they want, when it arrives at their door, it comes in a form [like this](https://trendspider.com/blog/dell-and-super-micro-power-musks-ai-ambitions/). In other words, customers are getting Kitchen-Aid refrigerators sent to their fucking door that contain 30-90 Nvidia Blackwell chips and liquid cooling systems within them. No more receiving your SMCI rack order in individual server pieces that you have to assemble on your own. This greatly increases the speed in which these new data centers can go live. In most cases, these racks can be installed and plugged in in **under a day.**\n\nAdditionally, this also helps to increase their margins over time.\n\nTraditionally, SMCI sold servers as modular building blocks. things like:\n\n* 1U and 2U server chassis\n* Motherboards\n* Power supplies\n* GPU trays\n\nCustomers (like system integrators, VARs, or hyperscalers) would assemble these into racks themselves. That\u2019s low-margin business, because you\u2019re selling parts, not solutions. the DCBBS racks contain:\n\n* CPU & GPU servers (e.g., Nvidia Blackwell, AMD EPYC, Intel Gaudi)\n* Total liquid cooling (cold plates, manifolds, chillers, etc.)\n* Network switches\n* Rack management software\n* Power distribution units (PDUs)\n\nWhy does this new model increase margins? Because it is a shift SMCI is making, from selling modular pieces that must be assembled, to selling complete solutions that are pre-assembled and ready for use upon arrival. This gives SMCI increased pricing power and in turn, increased margins. Below is a comparison table to illustrate the logic:\n\n|Old Model (Per Server)|Rack-Scale Model (Per Rack)|\n|:-|:-|\n|Sell parts separately|Sell the full system integration|\n|$5K\u2013$15K ASP/server|$250K\u2013$2M ASP per rack|\n|6\u201310% gross margin|**15\u201325%+ gross margin**|\n|Low-value add|**Turnkey AI solution** = premium pricing|\n\nNow lets go more in depth:\n\n**1. Higher Average Selling Price (ASP) per Unit**\n\n* Traditional air-cooled servers sell for **$10K\u2013$50K** each.\n* Liquid-cooled **DCBBS racks** (often 64\u201396 GPUs) sell for **$2\u20135 million per rack**.\n* Even if gross margins stay in the 8\u201310% range, **gross profit per rack is 40\u00d7\u201380\u00d7 higher** than per-server sales.\n\nHigher ASP = greater dollar-margin per unit sold, allowing SMCI to increase overall margins even with a similar percentage.\n\n**2. Bundled Value = Control Over Margin Levers**\n\nWith DCBBS, SMCI is not just selling a server, it\u2019s delivering:\n\n* 8\u201312 liquid-cooled GPU servers\n* 2000+ liquid-cooled racks a month\n* Integrated CDUs (coolant distribution units)\n* Power delivery + networking\n* Cabling, plumbing, and chassis integration\n* Software/BIOS optimization\n\nAll of these are designed, manufactured, and **assembled in-house**, which means:\n\n1. Vertical integration reduces dependency on low-margin commodity components\n2. Custom bundles let SMCI charge more for value-added services\n3. Standardization improves yield, reduces warranty risk, and shortens labor cycles\n\n**3. Faster Time-to-Deployment = Premium Pricing Power**\n\nSMCI can ship **fully integrated, plug-and-play racks in 3\u20134 weeks**, while others take 8\u201312 weeks+ with multiple vendors.\n\nFor hyperscalers and AI startups racing to bring GPU clusters online, this **speed translates into willingness to pay more**, or at least not negotiate down.\n\nFor example: A customer buying a $2.5M rack from SMCI may avoid:\n\n* Extra $500k/month in AI cloud rental costs\n* 3\u20134 month delay in deploying AI training models\n* Facility delays in retrofitting for traditional HVAC-based servers\n\nBelow is a table below comparing liquid-cooled racks Time-to-Deployment between SMCI and its competitors:\n\n|**Vendor**|**Liquid-Cooled Rack Output (Est.)**|**Time to Deployment**|**Notes**|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|**SMCI**|**\\~2,000+ racks/month**|**3\u20134 weeks** (from factory)|DCBBS fully integrated, scalable, Blackwell-ready|\n|**Dell**|*Unknown (not disclosed)*|\\~6\u201310 weeks (unverified)|IR7000 liquid-cooled racks for hyperscalers, but no output figures released|\n|**HPE**|*Limited modular deployments*|\\~8\u201312 weeks (pods)|Offers liquid-cooled AI systems (e.g. Cray EX, Apollo), but mostly for supercomputing clients|\n|**Lenovo**|*Unknown*|6+ weeks (via FIS programs)|Neptune liquid cooling, but most integration is not turnkey at SMCI pace|\n\nThis \u201ctime-value\u201d premium enhances margin per contract.\n\n**4. Liquid Cooling = Lower Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) for Clients**\n\nClients benefit from:\n\n* 30\u201350%+ reduction in power usage (no fans/blowers at server level)\n* Higher rack density \u2192 fewer racks \u2192 less real estate\n* Reduced HVAC burden \u2192 capex + opex savings\n\nBecause DCBBS racks are pre-validated and ready for 80\u2013100+ kW loads, customers can safely go denser per rack \u2014 which:\n\n* Makes SMCI\u2019s per-rack offering more economically valuable\n* Lets them preserve pricing vs. air-cooled OEMs like Lenovo, HPE, or Dell, who may cut prices to remain competitive\n\nHigher value-to-customer means more pricing power = higher gross margin\n\n**5. Operational Efficiency at Scale**\n\nSMCI is building out:\n\n* A 3 million square foot manufacturing campus in Silicon Valley and Malaysia\n* A supply chain optimized for GPU pre-allocation, liquid cooling parts, and just-in-time rack assembly\n\nThis allows SMCI to:\n\n* Mass produce racks with minimal retooling\n* Reduce per-rack cost at high volume\n* Use contract-based repeat orders (like the DataVolt $20B deal) to plan capacity\n\nEconomies of scale + predictable assembly processes = declining cost/unit \u2192 rising margin\n\nBelow is a comparison table illustrating the margin impact:\n\n|**Advantage**|**Margin Impact**|\n|:-|:-|\n|High ASP per rack|Higher gross profit in dollar terms|\n|Bundled hardware/services|Increases perceived value + vertical profit|\n|Speed to deploy (3-4 weeks)|Pricing premium vs. slower OEMs|\n|Energy/cooling savings for customer|Improves TCO \u2192 preserves SMCI pricing power|\n|Factory integration at scale|Lowers per-rack cost with volume|\n\nSo far, we've learned how DCBBS can substantially decrease build times for customers and how it could potentially increase margins for SMCI.\n\nNow to the fun part: The UAE Deal\n\nAfter doing some ape fisted carpet eating math, I estimate that the total cost of the 5GW AI Campus would be about $125 billion (assuming **each rack** draws about 100kW and sells for $2.5 million). Based on these numbers, I had ChatGPT build a table with a break down of what SMCI would get based on various percentages of the project they would be responsible for and superimposed a likelihood of occurrence formula in there:\n\n|Coverage %|Likelihood of Occurrence|Racks Provided|G42 Total Payment to SMCI|Estimated Gross Profit (USD) 9.7%|Estimated EBITDA (USD)|Estimated EPS|Implied Share Price (@20x PE)|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|1%|Highly Likely (90%)|500|$1,250,000,000|$121,250,000|$103,062,500|$1.87|$37.40|\n|2%|Very Likely (80%)|1000|$2,500,000,000|$242,500,000|$206,125,000|$3.75|$75.00|\n|5%|Likely (65%)|2500|$6,250,000,000|$606,250,000|$515,312,500|$9.37|$187.40|\n|10%|Possible (45%)|5000|$12,500,000,000|$1,212,500,000|$1,030,625,000|$18.74|$374.80|\n|25%|Plausible (25%)|12500|$31,250,000,000|$3,031,250,000|$2,576,562,500|$46.84|$936.80|\n|50%|Unlikely (10%)|25000|$62,500,000,000|$6,062,500,000|$5,153,125,000|$93.70|$1,874.00|\n|100%|Very Unlikely (3%)|50000|$125,000,000,000|$12,125,000,000|$10,306,250,000|$187.40|$3,748.00|\n\nAs you can see, even with a conservative PE of 20x and 9.7% margins, if SMCI gets even 2-5% of the project, thats an EPS of $3.75-9.37 and a share price of $75-187 a share.\n\n**How ChatGPT Calculated the Likelihoods**\n\nThis wasn\u2019t a statistical model but rather a strategic probability estimate based on 5 weighted factors:\n\n**1. Historical Precedent (30%)**\n\n* No hyperscaler or government has ever given 100% of a 5GW AI deployment to one vendor.\n* Datavolt gave SMCI a $20B deal, but likely part of a larger multi-phase build \u2014 suggesting up to 25% is plausible.\n\n**2. Industry Norm for Diversification (25%)**\n\n* Large clients (e.g. AWS, G42, Meta) **split procurement across 2\u20134 OEMs** for risk mitigation, price leverage, and geopolitical hedging.\n* Most national-scale AI campuses split rack-scale work among **Dell, Lenovo, HPE, SMCI, Nvidia integrators**, etc.\n\n**3. SMCI Production Capacity (20%)**\n\n* SMCI can output \\~5,000 racks/month total, **2,000+ liquid cooled**.\n* To hit 50\u2013100% coverage of a 5GW facility, they\u2019d need to commit 6\u201312 months of global capacity, which limits probability unless it's multi-year.\n\n**4. Geopolitical Alignment (15%)**\n\n* SMCI already has deep regional partnerships (Saudi Arabia, Abu Dhabi), so 10\u201325% is well within reach.\n* But **50\u2013100%** would likely require **exclusive national alignment**, which is rare unless the vendor is sovereign or majority-owned.\n\n**5. First-Mover Advantage & Time-to-Deploy (10%)**\n\n* SMCI\u2019s lead time (3\u20134 weeks vs. 8\u201312 weeks) is a massive advantage.\n* For urgency-sensitive contracts, this could **justify awarding 25% or more** \u2014 but not 100%, barring a disruption in Dell/HPE supply.\n\nI think its also important to add, two job listenings have been posted for positions in Abu Dhabi:\n\n[Account Sales Manager](https://jobs.supermicro.com/job/United-Arab-Emirates-Abu-Dha-Sales-Account-Manager/1148026500/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n\n[Technology Enablement Engineer](https://jobs.supermicro.com/job/United-Arab-Emirates-Abu-Dha-Technology-Enablement-Engineer/1246502400/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n\n\n\nAll in all, SMCI could stand to make a assload of money from a G42 UAE deal.\n\nLast but not least, Cramer is [\u201cSick of\u201d](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/topstocks/jim-cramer-is-sick-of-super-micro-computer-stock-should-you-sell-smci-now/ar-AA1F0NkN?ocid=finance-verthp-feeds) SMCI\n\n  \nTL:DR: SMCI provides the fastest Time-to-Deployment of any of its competitors with its liquid-cooled DCBBS solution and this could help increase margins overtime and make it a more attractive buy to larger customers ready to deploy immediately. Capturing even 5% of the G42 UAE deal could result in a share price of $180+ a share. SMCI is already hiring for positions in Abu Dhabi.\n\nPosition: 15 $91c 1/16",

    "selftext": "Members of the so-called Magnificent 7 group added an aggregate $837.5 billion in market value on Monday after the U.S. and China\u00a0agreed to pause\u00a0most tariffs on each other\u2019s goods.\n\nIt marked the largest collective move for the group since April 9.\n\nTechnology stocks \u2014 such as semiconductor firms and smartphone makers \u2014 have been hit hard as trade tensions between the world\u2019s two largest economies threatened to disrupt supply chains and hurt some of the biggest U.S. businesses.\n\nBut investors breathed a sigh of relief after talks between the U.S. and China over the weekend yielded a temporary pause in \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs.\n\nIn the U.S.,\u00a0Nvidia, which still faces a number of restrictions on the chips it is allowed to ship to China, was around 5% higher on Monday, while\u00a0AMD\u00a0was also up about 5%.\u00a0Broadcom\u00a0rose around 6% higher, while\u00a0Qualcomm\u00a0added about 5%.\n\nOther companies in the semiconductor supply chain also jumped.\u00a0Marvell, which last week postponed a previously scheduled investor day due to macroeconomic uncertainty, surged 8%.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., the world\u2019s largest chipmaker, saw its U.S.-listed shares jump around 6%. TSMC\u2019s Taiwan-listed stock closed before the tariff announcement.\n\nIn Europe,\u00a0ASML, a supplier of critical machinery required to manufacture the most advanced chips, rallied 6%.\u00a0Infineon\u00a0was also sharply higher.\n\nSemiconductors and some electronics received an exemption from President Donald Trump\u2019s reciprocal tariffs last month, but the U.S. signaled the reprieve was temporary and that these products could still be in line for special duties.\n\nInvestors have been concerned about the impact on major tech stocks, especially those with exposure to China such as Apple and Amazon, whose shares have been under pressure this year.\n\nApple, which still\u00a0makes 90% of its iPhones in China, said during its earnings report this month that it expects tariffs will add\u00a0$900 million to its costs for the current quarter. Apple shares rose about 6%.\n\nAmazon\u00a0jumped 8% on Monday. Many sellers on Amazon rely on Chinese products.\n\nU.S.-listed Chinese tech stocks also surged. Chinese e-commerce giants\u00a0Alibaba\u00a0and\u00a0JD.com\u00a0were higher, alongside internet firm\u00a0Baidu.\n\n\u201cWith US/China clearly on an accelerated path for a broader deal we believe new highs for the market and tech stocks are now on the table in 2025 as investors will likely focus on the next steps in these trade discussions which will happen over the coming months,\u201d Daniel Ives, global head of technology research at Wedbush Securities, said in a note on Monday.\n\n\u201cThis morning is a huge win for the bulls and a best case scenario post this weekend in our view.\u201d\n\nSource: [https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/12/global-chip-and-tech-stocks-rally-as-us-and-china-agree-tariff-cut.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/12/global-chip-and-tech-stocks-rally-as-us-and-china-agree-tariff-cut.html)",

    "selftext": "Hi! I am an ex-prop shop equity trader. This is a daily watchlist for short-term trading: I might trade all/none of the stocks listed, and even stocks not listed! I am targeting potentially good candidates for short-term trading; I have no opinion on them as investments. The potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting, everything else is secondary.\n\nNews: [Xi Fortifies China's Economy Before First Talks On Trade With Us](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-07/xi-fortifies-china-s-economy-before-first-talks-on-trade-with-us)\n\n[**AMD (Advanced Micro Devices)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AMD&p=d)\\- Reported Q1 earnings with EPS of $0.62 vs. $0.61 expected and revenue of $5.47B vs. $5.46B expected. AMD mentioned a $1.5B revenue hit due to U.S. chip export restrictions to China, with $800M in costs linked to AI chip curbs. Overall pretty mixed results, stock spiked AH but gave back most of the gains, currently only up 1%. No particular level I'm watching. Overall I see less risk in this (and the other semis) now that most of the major chip companies (ARM reports today) have defined their losses due to the chip restriction- and we have clear defined numbers as to how much a stock will move if they're lifted. Obviously another bad catalyst would be completely stopping all exports, but that seems unlikely at this point.\n\n[**DIS (Disney)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=DIS&p=d)\\- Reported Q2 EPS of $1.45 vs. $1.21 expected and revenue of $23.6B vs. $23.34B exp. Raised full-year EPS outlook to $5.75, +16% vs. prior guidance. Parks revenue grew 6% to $8.9B. Disney+ added 1.4M subs, hitting $336M in operating profit. I looked into the earnings and interestingly, I think profitability over raw subscriber growth was the spotlight in Disney+. Overall great earnings, which they capped off with softening international parks revenue, then followed it up with a park in Abu Dhabi (lol). Disneyworld generates roughly $10M a day in revenue, so it'll be interesting to see how much a park in Abu Dhabi will cost (10 times more?? /s)\n\n[**SMCI (Super Micro Computer)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SMCI&p=d)\\- Issued weak guidance post-earnings, citing \u201ceconomic uncertainty and tariff impacts.\u201d EPS of 0.31 vs .50 exp, revenue of $4.60B vs. $5.42B expected. Ever since the spike back in February, this stock has essentially been (relatively) non-volatile, still watching $30 level. SMCI's server business is essentially linked to AI/data center build-outs- but this stock hasn't been moving that much with tech companies announcing greater AI spend. Accounting issues could return (highly unlikely), tariffs get worse, etc.\n\n[**PLTR (Palantir Technologies)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=PLTR&p=d)\\- Currently holding a short position due to the stock's massive run up to 125. Stop set at 115 (near yesterday\u2019s high), earnings were released on Monday. I kind of see a similar pattern that came when NVDA was trading near $140 in this stock: (NVDA obviously has better fundamentals than PLTR) but we had a massive run up, earnings that were excellent but still couldn't live up to the hype, and a subsequent selloff. For now, nothing has really changed my mind about covering my short unless we have a massive turn. Government spending cuts are the main risk for the company.",

AMD said sales for its laptop and PC chips, which it calls client revenue, surged 68% year over year because of strong demand for chips called Zen 5 that the company released last summer.\n\nGaming sales, however, declined 30% on an annual basis, which the company attributed to a decrease in console chip revenue.\n\nAMD\u2019s embedded segment, which is mostly sales from the company\u2019s 2022 acquisition of Xilinx, declined 3% on an annual basis to $823 million.\n\nSource: [https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/06/amd-earnings-report-q1-2025-.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/06/amd-earnings-report-q1-2025-.html)",

    "selftext": ">The US economy contracted at the start of the year for the first time since 2022 on a monumental pre-tariffs import surge and softer consumer spending, a first snapshot of the ripple effects from President Donald Trump\u2019s trade policy.\n\n>Inflation-adjusted\u00a0gross domestic product\u00a0decreased an annualized 0.3% in the first quarter, well below average growth of about 3% in the prior two years, according to the government\u2019s initial estimate published Wednesday. Net exports\u00a0subtracted\u00a0nearly 5 percentage points from GDP, the most on record, the Bureau of Economic Analysis report showed.\n\n>Consumer spending\u00a0\u2014 which accounts for two-thirds of GDP \u2014 advanced at a 1.8% pace, the weakest since mid-2023. Business\u00a0outlays for equipment, the lone bright spot in the report, increased an annualized 22.5%.\n\n|Indicator|Actual|Estimate|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|GDP|\\-0.3%|\\-0.2%|\n|Personal consumption|\\+1.8%|\\+1.2%|\n|PCE price index, excl. food, energy|\\+3.5%|\\+3.1%|\n\n>The GDP data highlight the scramble by companies to secure merchandise ahead of expansive tariffs. Looking ahead, many economists anticipate the higher duties will cause a\u00a0supply shock, challenging businesses and leading to a pullback in demand as higher prices push cash-strapped Americans closer to the brink.\n\n>Forecasters currently see\u00a0nearly even\u00a0odds of the US falling into a recession in the next year. Consumers are also growing increasingly anxious that tariffs will take a toll on the labor market and drive up the cost of living.\n\n>The latest GDP figures showed\u00a0imports\u00a0surged an annualized about 41% \u2014 the biggest advance in nearly five years. Because these goods and services aren\u2019t produced in the US, they are subtracted from GDP. Economists see the sharp widening of the trade deficit reversing in the second quarter.\n\n>Typically, imported merchandise moves into warehouses or directly to storefronts. However, the report showed\u00a0business inventories\u00a0contributed 2.25 percentage points to GDP during the quarter, the most since the end of 2021. The recent flood imports may instead show up in higher inventories in coming months and, along with a narrowing trade gap, provide a lift to second-quarter GDP.\n\n>Because swings in trade and inventories can sometimes distort overall GDP, economists prefer looking at\u00a0final sales\u00a0to private domestic purchasers for a better snapshot of demand. This measure increased at a 3% pace in the first quarter after rising an annualized 2.9% at the end of 2024.\n\n>Growth in consumer spending was driven by services and nondurable goods.\n\nLink: [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-30/us-economy-contracts-for-first-time-since-2022-on-imports-surge](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-30/us-economy-contracts-for-first-time-since-2022-on-imports-surge)\n\n**My take:** As is commonly said, we haven't even begun to feel the effects of Trump's trade policy yet- shortages of products haven't begun hitting American consumers, but we're going to start feeling the effects this summer. We're likely in for a painful day in the markets today.\n\nI'm mainly interested in consumer discretionary companies to day trade (SBUX mainly) and also watching tech names like SMCI (earnings), NVDA/DELL/AMD (off of the new Deepseek news).\n\nCurrently long VXX but may kick that out at the open depending on how we open.",

This caused a surge to $9 yesterday, and I'm interested in how it does at the open, but ultimately biased short. Not interested in taking a short position unless we break $9/10. Interesting thought experiment : Is their fleet of cars is worth far more (after the effects of tariffs) than what the company is actually valued at? \n\n[**LLY (Eli Lilly)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=LLY&p=d)\\- LLY's experimental oral drug, orforglipron, achieved up to 7.9% weight loss and blood sugar reduction in a late-stage trial involving type 2 diabetes patients, exceeding expectations. Overall, it's too high priced to day trade, but will likely size down to trade it if it continues to rise.

NVDA expects a $5.5B charge tied to its H20 chips, while AMD anticipates an $800M impact from its MI308 chips. These policy moves mainly due to the US's attempts to maintain the AI lead but affect semis companies negatively. The restrictions create uncertainty in hardware markets. Risks include prolonged geopolitical conflict, regulatory overhang, and market share loss in China.\n\n[**UNH (UnitedHealth Group)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=UNH&p=d)\\- Reported Q1 earnings miss with EPS of $7.20 and revenue of $109.6B, and also lowered full-year guidance.

These chips were lobotomized versions initially designed to comply with earlier export controls but are now subject to stricter licensing requirements under the Trump administration's policies. I'm mainly interested if NVDA breaks $100 to the downside. The semis industry is volatile due to escalating U.S.-China trade tensions, affecting AMD and INTC (not as much) as well.

Most of these brokerages have been selling off from the market peak around mid Feb, but I don't consider these to be interesting at the moment for outperformance, unless they fall further.

We've had a significant selloff for the past 2 months from 750 to 500, and while not extremely liquid due to price/volume, it's still worth pursuing if there is some catalyst for a forced sale of Instagram (unlikely).

    "title": "Trump & Lutnick\u2019s Semiconductor Tariff Chaos: A Bull Trap, Insider Trading, and Market Manipulation Exposed",
    "selftext": "Alright, Reddit, buckle up because we\u2019re diving into the absolute rollercoaster that is Trump\u2019s tariff policy on semiconductors, spearheaded by his Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick. This is a wild ride of mixed signals, market swings, and what smells like blatant manipulation to make billionaires richer while the rest of us get played. If you\u2019re in the markets or just curious about how the sausage gets made in DC, you need to read this. Monday\u2019s announcement is going to be a doozy, and I\u2019m calling it now: we\u2019re staring down a potential disaster for the semiconductor industry, a textbook bull trap, and some seriously shady insider trading vibes.\n\nLet\u2019s start with the Friday bombshell. On April 11, 2025, the **Trump administration** dropped a *memo* that had Wall Street doing cartwheels: semiconductors, smartphones, laptops, and a bunch of other electronics were exempted from the massive \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs Trump slapped on China (we\u2019re talking 125% levies\u2014insane). The U.S. Customs and Border Protection bulletin listed **20 product categories, including memory chips, disc drives, and flat panel displays, all getting a free pass.** Tech stocks like Apple, Dell, and NVIDIA went nuts. The S&P 500 was already down 10% since Trump took office, so this felt like a lifeline. Futures soared, X was buzzing with \u201cbull market confirmed\u201d takes, and everyone thought we were headed for a recovery rally. I mean, who wouldn\u2019t be bullish? It looked like Trump was giving Big Tech a massive break.\n\nBut then, Sunday morning hits, and **Howard Lutnick** goes on ABC\u2019s This Week and basically says, **\u201cPsych!\u201d** He clarified that those exemptions? Yeah, they\u2019re *temporary.* Semiconductors and electronics are still getting hit with **\u201csector-specific\u201d** tariffs in **\u201ca month or two,\u201d** tied to national security under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act. These aren\u2019t negotiable, unlike the reciprocal tariffs. Lutnick\u2019s exact words: \u201cThese are things that are national security, that we need to be made in America.\u201d Suddenly, the whole narrative flips. The Friday exemption wasn\u2019t a win\u2014it was a head fake. And now, Monday\u2019s announcement is looming, where Trump\u2019s expected to double down on these semiconductor tariffs, potentially spelling chaos for the industry.\n\nLet\u2019s talk about why this is a big deal for semiconductors. The global chip supply chain is insanely complex. Most semiconductors are designed in the U.S., fabricated in Taiwan (TSMC, anyone?), and assembled or finished in places like China. If Trump slaps tariffs on chips coming from China\u2014or worse, starts a national security probe that messes with the whole supply chain\u2014prices are going to spike. Companies like NVIDIA, AMD, and Qualcomm are going to take a hit, not to mention downstream players like Apple, who assemble iPhones in China. Lutnick\u2019s pushing this \u201cre-shore to America\u201d narrative, but building chip fabs in the U.S. takes years and billions of dollars. TSMC\u2019s Arizona plant isn\u2019t even fully online yet! In the meantime, costs go up, supply chains choke, and consumers get stuck with pricier gadgets\u2014or straight-up shortages.\n\nNow, let\u2019s get to the bull trap. Friday\u2019s exemption announcement was like **catnip for traders.** Everyone piled into tech stocks, thinking the tariff threat was gone. But Lutnick\u2019s Sunday comments yanked the rug out. Posts on X were already screaming about it: \u201cYesterday\u2019s exemptions weren\u2019t surrender\u2014they were a setup,\u201d one user said. Another called it a \u201cheadline-driven market\u201d where the administration is \u201csteering price action.\u201d If Monday\u2019s announcement confirms heavy tariffs, those bullish bets from Friday are going to get crushed. We could see a brutal sell-off in semiconductor stocks, dragging the Nasdaq and S&P 500 down with it. The market\u2019s already been a mess\u2014wildest swings since COVID, down 10% since January 20. This could be the trap that catches all the dip-buyers off guard.\n\nAnd here\u2019s where it gets really ugly: the insider trading and market manipulation angle. Let\u2019s rewind to April 9, when Trump posted on Truth Social, **\u201cTHIS IS A GREAT TIME TO BUY!!! DJT,\u201d** just hours before he announced a 90-day tariff pause for most countries (except China). The S&P 500 surged 9%, Nasdaq jumped 12.2%, and Trump Media\u2019s stock shot up 22%. Coincidence? Democrats like Adam Schiff and Maxine Waters aren\u2019t buying it. They\u2019re calling for SEC investigations, saying Trump\u2019s post reeks of insider trading. Schiff\u2019s letter to the White House asked who knew about the tariff pause beforehand and whether anyone traded on it. When Trump was asked when he decided on the pause, he was cagey: \u201cOver the last few days\u2026 probably came together early this morning.\u201d Yeah, right.\n\nFast forward to this weekend\u2019s semiconductor flip-flop, and it\u2019s d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. Friday\u2019s exemption pumps the market, Lutnick\u2019s Sunday reversal sets up a crash, and Monday\u2019s announcement could be the knockout punch. The timing is too convenient. Billionaires like Bill Ackman, who\u2019s been cozy with Trump but criticized tariffs, are probably sitting pretty, knowing the playbook. Meanwhile, retail traders who went all-in on Friday are about to get smoked. It\u2019s not just Trump\u2019s Truth Social posts\u2014Lutnick\u2019s been all over TV, hyping tariffs one day, backtracking the next. The mixed signals aren\u2019t just chaotic; they\u2019re starting to look deliberate. As one X post put it, \u201cThe biggest rally of the year would come on the day Lutnick gets fired.\u201d That\u2019s the vibe right now.\n\nWhy does this matter? Because semiconductors are the backbone of everything. Your phone, your car, your fridge\u2014they all need chips. If Trump and Lutnick tank the industry with tariffs, it\u2019s not just stock prices that suffer. Inflation\u2019s already a worry (economists have been screaming about tariffs spiking prices), and chip shortages could make 2021\u2019s supply chain mess look like a picnic. Plus, China\u2019s not sitting still\u2014they hiked their own tariffs to 125% on Friday and are \u201cevaluating\u201d Trump\u2019s exemptions. This could spiral into a full-blown trade war, and guess who pays the price? Not the billionaires with their offshore accounts\u2014us.\n\nSo, what\u2019s the play here? Brace yourself. Monday\u2019s announcement could confirm tariffs that gut semiconductor stocks and ripple through tech. If you\u2019re holding NVIDIA or TSMC, maybe hedge with some puts. Cash is king if the market tanks. And keep an eye on X and Truth Social\u2014Trump\u2019s posts are basically market signals now, legal or not. The bigger picture? This administration\u2019s tariff policy is a clown show, and Lutnick\u2019s either in over his head or part of the game. Either way, the semiconductor world\u2019s about to get rocked, and not in a good way.What do you all think? Are we headed for a crash? Is this insider trading staring us in the face?\n\nDrop your takes below\u2014I\u2019m all ears.\n\n**TL;DR:** Trump\u2019s Friday exemption for semiconductors was a head fake that pumped the market. Lutnick\u2019s Sunday reversal sets up a brutal Monday announcement that could crush the chip industry. This smells like a bull trap, with insider trading and market manipulation letting Trump\u2019s billionaire buddies cash in while retail gets screwed. Semiconductors are about to take a beating\u2014watch out.\n\n**Sources:**\n\n* Reuters: \u201cTrump says chips from China will face national security probe; further tariffs expected\u201d (April 13, 2025)\n* Axios: \u201cTrump\u2019s tariff exemption for electronics is temporary, Lutnick says\u201d (April 13, 2025)\n* TIME: \u201cBreaking Down \u2018Insider Trading\u2019 Accusations Leveled at Trump\u201d (April 10, 2025)\n* The Washington Post: \u201cTariffs on chips, phones, laptops still coming, commerce secretary warns\u201d (April 13, 2025)\n* X posts on tariff exemptions and Lutnick\u2019s comments (April 13, 2025)",

    "selftext": "This is a opinion post I wanted to share.\n\nI've been thinking a lot about the current tech landscape and wanted to share a perspective \u2014 especially for those investing with a 5\u201310 year horizon.\n\nThere are certain companies I see not just as \"big tech,\" but as quasi-utilities \u2014 firms so deeply embedded in the digital infrastructure of the world that they\u2019ve become nearly irreplaceable.\n\nThink about it:\n\nNvidia doesn\u2019t just sell GPUs \u2014 it is the foundation of modern AI. CUDA is so entrenched that even AMD can\u2019t catch up, not because of hardware, but because of software and developer lock-in. There's other companies that could rival them but they would need huge sums of cash, geniuses and alot of time to catch up. \n\nTSMC is the world\u2019s brain factory. Apple, Nvidia, AMD, and others literally can\u2019t ship without them. Same thing with them, it's not impossible to replace them, but feasible if done right. \n\nMicrosoft is everywhere \u2014 OS, cloud, productivity, security. It\u2019s not just market share \u2014 it\u2019s organizational dependency. Also replaceable but highly difficult with their grasp on OSes, users and corporate infrastructures. \n\nASML makes the machines that make the chips \u2014 and no one else can. Full stop. Atleast not yet. \n\n\nThese companies aren\u2019t easily disrupted. Even if the U.S. loses geopolitical influence, the world still runs on their products. The global demand isn\u2019t for America \u2014 it\u2019s for what these companies produce.\n\nSo honestly, if the market pulls back again on Monday isn't this a good thing to really deepen your position on these quasi irreplaceable companies as long as they are irreplaceable? I can't see a competitor for these companies replacing them in the next months to years, but maybe I am delusional. \n\n\nBut here's a thought I keep coming back to:\n\n> What happens if their products become too expensive to buy?\n\n\nImagine a world where:\n\nGeopolitical tariffs, trade restrictions, or currency pressures drive up the cost of goods by 50\u2013100%. Which it's shaping up to be. \n\nA flagship phone or AI accelerator suddenly costs twice as much depending on where you are.\n\nDo people still buy them? Do enterprises delay upgrades? Do governments intervene?\n\nThese companies have huge margins, so theoretically they could eat some of the cost. But would they?\n\nOr would they:\n\nStick to cheaper, more generic alternatives with lower R&D spend?\n\nSplit product lines into high-end \u201cpremium zones\u201d and \u201cglobal budget models\u201d?\n\nSlow innovation because they can\u2019t finance bleeding-edge development with shrinking profits? And even if they do, other rivals can't just produce money out of thin air to close the gap when the monopoly holders are struggling aswell. \n\nThis could create a weird paradox: companies that are technically irreplaceable, but economically unsustainable in certain regions.\n \n\nWhat do you think?\n\nWould consumers and enterprises tolerate huge price increases just to stay in these ecosystems?\n\nWould these companies risk their margins or stall innovation?\n\nAre there companies you see as equally irreplaceable but more resilient to this kind of shock?\n\nAs a closing statement I just still can't fathom these scenarios:\n\nCompanies switch to Linux because Microsoft products are 100% more expensive across the board \n\nCompanies and consumers stop buying Nvidia because they won't need Gpus or AI compute \n\nASML closes their doors because apple, Nvidia, amd et Al. Don't have the customers needed to keep TSMC afloat. \n\nI just can't imagine a world in which we won't need CPUs, Windows/Microsoft or Ai. I mean it's possible but will the world really step back years of innovation? Or let technological innovation stagnate until the weird orange man is deplaced? \n\nWhats your thoughts on this? ",

While screening the Swiss Performance Index I found Arzyta, a large bakery. Why I\u2018m bullish on the stock:\n- No operations in the US\n- No sales in the US\n- Sourcing their commodities (wheat) mainly within Europe, Australia, Malaysia -> no tariffs\n- Sales is 89% Europe, 11% RoW\n- they continously improved their balance sheet\n- they bought back a hybrid bond which will reduce their financing costs by approx. EUR 11.5% (this is 8.34% of their free cash flow!)They expect this to fully materialite in 2025 \u2014> the buy back happened in October 2024\n\nThe above are the facts (soure is their 2024 FY report).\n\nNow some additional thoughts:\n- Wheat producers in EU will most likely not sell anymore to the USA which means they will have a over capacity which leads to lower prices. Wheat is perishable that means the cost of purchase will most likely decrease amd hence increase their operational margin\n\n- Given the high tariffs imposed by the US it is likely that the EU and Switzerland will decrease their interest rates which means ARYN could refinance them cheaper\n\n- The market should recognize the company to be a Consumer Staple which would allow higher multiples in terms of valuation\n\n- There are only few analysts covering the stock (all of them have a Buy or Strong Buy rating)\n\nI entered a smaller position in the stock this week. \n\nWhat are your thoughts?

EPS beat estimates, and the company announced it would integrate Bitcoin into its treasury reserve. This confirms prior speculation tied to Ryan Cohen\u2019s meeting with Strategy\u2019s chairman.\u00a0**This is a massive catalyst**\u00a0solely based on the fact that if GME buys enough of the CC, we may see it trade at a premium the same way as MSTR does. (MSTR usually trades at a 2x valuation to the amount of CC it holds.). Volatility in the CC market could create swings in reported earnings, but makes GME easier to track price-wise. The core retail business still saw a 28% Y/Y decline in sales which is somewhat of a red flag. Biased positive.\n\n**Related Tickers:**\u00a0MSTR, COIN\n\n[**TSLA (Tesla)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TSLA&p=d)\\- Second day of straight gains, with shares up 3.5% after a close to 50% selloff. I'm Interested in $290 level after failing to break above it in the premarket. EV sentiment remains mixed for TSLA going forward- despite weakness in European sales, investor sentiment appears to be shifting positive. Sales in Europe fell 40% Y/Y, and Canada\u2019s EV rebate freeze adds regulatory actions into the mix. BYD is also close to overtaking TSLA, so I still don't consider this investible for the long-term (but it is tradable).\n\n[**DLTR (Dollar Tree)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=DLTR&p=d)**-**\u00a0DLTR will divest its Family Dollar segment for \\~$1B to Brigade Capital and Macellum, a massive markdown from the $9B it paid in 2015. The stock reacted fairly positively on this news, mainly because DLTR has been struggling since COVID. This move is an effort to clean up the balance sheet and refocus on the core business. The market probably views this favorably in the face of tariffs - less potential exposure to Family Dollar inevitably underperforming.\n\n**Related Tickers:**\u00a0DG\n\n[**NVDA (NVIDIA)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&p=d)\\- New energy rules in China disqualify NVDA's exportable H20 chip, threatening near-term revenue from a key market. Seen a minor selloff in NVDA of roughly $2, interested to see if we sell off more at the open. China\u2019s energy mandates are squeezing data center hardware providers, forcing chipmakers to adapt or lose access to the market. Having the H20 not be usable is a huge blow to NVDA's revenue, as it makes up close to 10% of their revenue in 2024. More regulation or bans could further limit access to Chinese demand, other chipmakers, etc. This DOES seem targeted to have Chinese companies focus on\n\n**Related Tickers:**\u00a0AMD, INTC, QCOM",

    "selftext": "TSMC (2330.TW), has pitched U.S. chip designers Nvidia (NVDA.O),, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD.O), and Broadcom (AVGO.O), about taking stakes in a joint venture that would operate Intel's (INTC.O), factories, according to four sources familiar with the matter.\n\nUnder the proposal, the Taiwanese chipmaking giant would run the operations of Intel's foundry division, which makes chips adapted for the needs of customers, but it would not own more than 50%, the sources said. Qualcomm (QCOM.O), has also been pitched by TSMC, according to one of the sources and a separate source.\n\nThe talks, which are at an early stage, come after U.S. President Donald Trump's administration requested TSMC, the world's leading contract chipmaker, assist in turning around the troubled U.S. industrial icon, the sources said on condition of anonymity because the talks are not public.\n\nThe details of the plan for TSMC to take no more than a 50% stake and its overtures to potential partners are being reported for the first time.\n\nAny final deal - the value of which is unclear - would need approval from the Trump administration, which does not want Intel or its foundry division to be fully foreign-owned, the sources said.\n\nIntel, TSMC, Nvidia, AMD and Qualcomm declined to comment. The White House and Broadcom did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nAt stake is the future of the U.S. chipmaking giant, whose shares have lost more than half of their value in the last year.\n\nIntel reported a 2024 net loss of $18.8 billion, its first since 1986, driven by large impairments. The foundry division's property and plant equipment had a book value of $108 billion as of December 31, according to a company filing.\n\nIntel stock rose more than 7% in premarket U.S. trading on Wednesday, while Nvidia, AMD, Broadcom and Qualcomm were up between 0.8% and 1.5%. TSMC closed about 1.8% higher in Taiwan.\n\nTrump is keen to revive Intel's fortunes, as he seeks to boost American advanced manufacturing, three of the sources said.\n\nThe sources said TSMC's joint venture pitch was made to potential backers before the Taiwanese chipmaker announced with Trump on March 3 that the company planned to make a fresh $100 billion investment in the United States that involves building five additional chip facilities there in coming years.\n\nTalks about the joint venture over Intel's foundry division have since continued, the three sources said, with TSMC looking to have more than one chip designer as a partner.\n\nMultiple companies have expressed interest in buying parts of Intel, but two of the four sources said the U.S. company has rejected discussions about selling its chip design house separately from the foundry division.\n\nQualcomm has exited earlier discussions to buy all or part of Intel, according to those people and a separate source.\n\nIntel board members have backed a deal and held negotiations with TSMC, while some executives are firmly opposed, according to two sources.\n\nIntel's contract manufacturing business, or foundry division, was a crucial part of former CEO Pat Gelsinger's effort to save Intel. Gelsinger was forced out by the board in December, which named two interim co-CEOs who have mothballed its forthcoming AI chip.\n\nAny deals between historical rivals TSMC and Intel would face major challenges and be costly and laborious. The two companies currently use vastly different processes, chemicals, and chipmaking tool setups at their factories, according to separate sources at the companies.\n\nIntel has previously had manufacturing partnerships with Taiwan's UMC (2303.TW), and Israel's Tower Semiconductor (TSEM.TA), that could offer a precedent for the two companies to operate together, but it remains unclear how such a partnership would work regarding trade manufacturing secrets.\n\nThe Taiwanese chipmaker wants potential investors in the joint venture to also be Intel advanced manufacturing customers, according to one of the sources.\n\nReuters reported last week, citing sources, that Nvidia and Broadcom are running manufacturing tests with Intel, using the company's most advanced production techniques, known as 18A. AMD is also evaluating whether Intel's 18A manufacturing process is suitable for it.\n\nBut 18A has been an area of contention in negotiations between Intel and TSMC, two sources said. During talks in February, Intel executives told TSMC that its advanced 18A manufacturing technology was superior to TSMC's 2-nanometer process, according to those sources.\n\nLink:\u00a0[https://www.reuters.com/technology/tsmc-pitched-intel-foundry-jv-nvidia-amd-broadcom-sources-say-2025-03-12/](https://www.reuters.com/technology/tsmc-pitched-intel-foundry-jv-nvidia-amd-broadcom-sources-say-2025-03-12/)",

Obviously this takes away a lot of investment in semis companies. Extremely negative catalyst but unlikely it will get repealed due to how much bipartisan support it had.\n\n**Catalyst/Sector Context:** The CHIPS and Science Act gave $280B in new funding to boost domestic research/manufacturing of semis in the US, and also aimed to strengthen supply chain resilience against China and widely considered to be a success because it spurred the development/dominance in the semis sector in America.\n\n**Risks:** If this gets repealed, we're likely going to see a pretty large pullback in the semis.

Interested to see how we go prior to the actual summit.\n\n**Catalyst/Sector Context:** Obviously an extremely bullish catalyst, we've bounced strongly off the $80K level recently. I usually trade through the ETFs as needed, and HOOD/Coinbase serve as proxies in case the ETFs aren't liquid or have already moved.\n\n**Risks:** Worth waiting for the catalyst and watching the CC Summit on Friday.

    "selftext": "Year after year Reddit picks the winners! I have kept a close eye on this subreddit for the last 10-15 years and have always been amazed by how ahead of the curve we are. Here is a list of stocks that have been heavily discussed over the years that have performed very well: \n\n- Tesla \n- Shopify \n- Block\n- NVDA \n- AMD \n- PLTR\n- AAPL \n- GME\n\nI know everyone in the comments is going to claim this is selection bias, but I can assure you these stocks were talked about so much it is unmistakable. People will also claim but these stocks have tanked since then! They have had significant corrections, but if you bought them when the buzz began you are still significantly in the green.  We will have to wait and see what the future holds. \n\n But what about the losers like movie pass!? Of course, some losers have been overly hyped too, but they are far less common. Also, in my opinion, the tone around stocks like movie pass is totally different than a stock like NVDA or SHOP. \n\nThe beautiful part about Reddit is you hear both sides, SHOP had a great deal of resistance back in 2017 and still does. A lot of people claimed it was a worthless company. People like Andrew Left were worshipped for shorting the company. But at the end of the day it was posted about non stop and has performed extremely well. People were also screaming from the top of the mountain that NVDA was overpriced in 2017, look where that ended up. \n\nLately it feels like we have entered a new \u201chype\u201d cycle where a lot of new names have been heavily mentioned. Similar to the hype cycle of 2016-2017 there is a lot of resistance and great discussions behind had. Here are some new names that I have noticed being posted about non stop: \n\n- RKLB\n- IONQ \n- BBAI\n- CAVA \n- LUNR\n- SMCI\n- OKLO \n- BRO\n\nI have been seeing these tickers fly around lately and see a lot of promise in them. They have performed very well in the past 6 months to a year, but we will have to wait and see where they end up in the long term. \n\nIt\u2019s a common meme to short every stock Reddit mentions, but I ultimately disagree. The hive mind is a very powerful and can seemingly predict the future. Keep in mind, the hive mind is what sets the vegas spreads. \n\nAnyway, that\u2019s my rant for the day. I am sure 75% of you will disagree with me, but again, thats why I love Reddit. Would love to hear your opinions. \n\nAlso, I have holdings in most of the companies listed. This is not financial advice. Do your own due diligence before buying any company I listed. ",

Will likely bail if we break $300 again.\n\n**Catalyst/Sector Context:** APP is a mobile tech company that helps devs market/monetize their apps through mobile advertising and marketing platforms, recently announced they were using AI.\n\n**Risks:** The short report allegations are true and they essentially get banned from the Google App/Apple App Store.\n\n**Related Tickers:** SNAP, PINS, TTD\n\n**Ticker:** [**MRNA (Moderna)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=MRNA&p=d)\n\n**Catalyst:** U.S. health officials are reevaluating a $590 million contract awarded to MRNA for bird flu vaccines.\n\n**Technicals:** We saw a decent dip (roughly 5%) in MRNA afterhours yesterday, not too interested in this further unless we see further headlines about the contract being pulled completely.\n\n**Catalyst/Sector Context:** MRNA had massive growth during 2020 for being one of the main manufacturers of the COVID vaccine- right now bird flu is being touted as the next potential big pandemic to vaccinate against.\n\n**Risks:** Cancellation is the the real catalyst after this news, or if the contract is awarded to a different company.\n\n**Related Tickers:** PFE, NVAX\n\n**Ticker:** [**SNOW (Snowflake)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SNOW&p=d)\n\n**Catalyst:** SNOW beat expectations, EPS of $0.30 vs. $0.18 exp. and revenue of $986.8M vs. $957.6M exp.\n\nThe company also provided an optimistic outlook, projecting current-quarter product revenue between $955M-$960M, driven by increasing demand for AI-related products.\n\n**Technicals:** Interested in $190 level.\n\n**Catalyst/Sector Context:** SNOW is a cloud-based data warehousing company and benefits from the demand for AI/ML solutions.\n\nAI is compute intensive which means they can charge more for their services.

Interestingly enough, ByBit was (theorized) to be hacked by North Korea.\n\n**Related Tickers:** MARA, RIOT\n\n**Ticker:** [**BABA (Alibaba)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=BABA&p=d)**/**[**FXI (iShares China Large-Cap ETF)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=FXI&p=d)**/Chinese Stocks**\n\n**Catalyst:** China plans to inject at least $55 billion into its largest banks in the coming months as part of a broader stimulus package, Yuan printer go brrrrr. This move is intended to supplement the core Tier 1 capital of China\u2019s six largest state-owned banks. This is the first bank recapitalization since the global financial crisis. 10T yuan (\\~$1.4T) debt package to support local government financing and economic stability.\n\n**Technicals:** We've seen a decent upmove on a lot of Chinese stocks due to this, we'll see how the market reacts.\n\n**Catalyst/Sector Context:** China has been going through a spending crisis, and the government's decision to inject substantial capital into its major banks is a move to strengthen liquidity. This initiative aims to enhance the lending capacity of banks, support local government financing, and stabilize the broader economy. It's a (pre) bailout baby.\n\n**Risks:** This does signal that China sees economic weakness, such as lack of demand due to their real estate sector they've traditionally leaned on for consumer growth/investment. Is this a long term fix? Who knows, but it worked for the US!\n\n**Related Tickers:** JD, BIDU\n\n**Ticker: SMCI**\n\n**Catalyst:** They finally filed an hour before the deadline on the final day! Really cutting it close there lol. The company has faced\u00a0allegations of accounting irregularities. These allegations, along with a failure to file specific financial forms have been a plague for the past year on the stock price. \n\n**Technicals:** We've seen a 20% move AH, so worth watching at open to see if we move further. Other than that, watching $50/$55 level. We'll see where it goes but worth noting that we've made a significant move back to pre-delisting threat prices already.\n\n**Catalyst/Sector Context:** Was at threat of delisting from the NASDAQ but now they're safe baby.\n\n**Risks:** People getting out, or the filing being rejected/advised to resubmit. The latter is a massive catalyst but low probability.\n\nEarnings: NVDA, CRM, SNOW, AI",

(Most of their training is done on NVDA chips)\n\n**Technicals:** Mainly interested to see if we can hold above $130 for NVDA- note that earnings are tomorrow so the short-term performance of the stock hinges on that. Currently long and sold 155C to hedge my position against it.\n\n**Catalyst/Sector Context:** We've seen the CHIPS act actually affect the way that semiconductor companies sell to China- most of those restrictions are bypassed, so this strengthening of export controls might actually affect the industry.\n\n**Risks:** More export controls may lead to China giving tariffs in retaliation- but again, most semis are supply constrained rather than demand constrained so I don't see it as a significant catalyst until more details are released.\n\n**Related Tickers:** [INTC](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=INTC&p=d), [QCOM](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=QCOM&p=d), [ASML](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=ASML&p=d)\n\n**Ticker:** [**BABA**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=BABA&p=d)**,** [**FXI (FTSE China 50 Index)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=FXI&p=d)\n\n**Catalyst:** BABA has introduced its own AI reasoning model within the Qwen framework (like how META has the Llama framework), while we have a surge of all Chinese stock performance following the Chinese government's announcement of liquidity measures.\n\n**Technicals:** It seems as if we've peaked (BABA has gone up close to 50% since the start of this month) for most Chinese stocks in the past few days, I would be interested in being short but I was on vacation this weekend. Interested in shorting BABA specifically if we make another large up move like we did on 2/20.\n\n**Catalyst/Sector Context:** BABA is one of the major competitors that is working on AI models, and is notably using NVDA cards to train its models. \n\n**Risks:** Mainly tariff news and news from other rivals with better models. Straightforward.\n\n**Related Tickers:** [JD](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=JD&p=d), [BIDU](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=BIDU&p=d)\n\n**Ticker:** [**PLTR (Palantir Technologies Inc)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=PLTR&p=d)\n\n**Catalyst:** Previously, PLTR faced concerns due to defense budget cuts and CEO Alex Karp reducing his stake in the company. We've seen it make a massive run from retail and fall just as quickly.\n\n**Technicals:** Interested in playing a small bounce- we're up \\~10% since last earnings report (and pre-crazy move), there is potential for a small bounce here but only entering a small position since it looks like we bottomed early premarket today. \n\n**Catalyst/Sector Context:** Trump directed the government to make significant cuts to the defense budget. (This is a far more significant catalyst than Alex Karp selling shares)\n\n**Risks:** PLTR lives and dies on defense contract money, so obviously further cuts/expansions will affect stock price.\n\n**Related Tickers:** [BA](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=BA&p=d), [GD](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=GD&p=d), [RTX](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=RTX&p=d)\n\n**Ticker:** [**COIN**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=COIN&p=d)**,** [**HOOD**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=HOOD&p=d)**,** [**MSTR**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=MSTR&p=d)\n\n**Catalyst:** The CC market is experiencing heightened volatility due to proposed tariffs and a significant security breach at Bybit, resulting in the loss of approximately $1.5 billion.\n\n**Technicals:** Not too interested in playing this long- still watching to see how we perform but the sell off resulting in the biggest Coin going to $90K has me watching the stock related proxies that deal with the market. \n\n**Catalyst/Sector Context:** CC platforms are highly susceptible to regulatory changes and security incidents.\n\nProposed tariffs affecting digital assets can lead to market vol, while large-scale hacks undermine investor trust and lead to sell-offs in the market as it spreads fear and people wanting to cash out.\n\n**Risks:** Regulatory interventions impose additional compliance costs and operational constraints on CC exchanges.\n\nSecurity breaches not only result in financial losses but also lead to decreased user adoption and revenue.\n\n**Related Tickers:** [MARA](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=MARA&p=d), [RIOT](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=RIOT&p=d)\n\n**Earnings:** [WDAY](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=WDAY&p=d), [INTU](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=INTU&p=d), [CPNG](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=CPNG&p=d)",

    "selftext": "With the current information I have, I think nvidia's growth is slowing down, and that they're gonna stay conservative to beat earnings. This, paired with their trend of falling on earnings regardless of surprises like during their previous two earnings, is gonna happen again and make the stock dip a few %.\n\nThings to keep in mind :\n\n1. Nvidia is gonna have to address the deepseek impacts, what could they possibly say to deter the fears that AI is getting more efficient to compute? It's not a question of chip performance, it's a question of being able to do the same or more, on less. Deepseek, while clearly did not cost 5.6mln to develop, still came out to have a pricetag that was significantly cheaper than OpenAI's development cost of 20bln (between 1-2bln, and this was on older Nvidia hardware). It's going to get increasingly more difficult to justify their exorbitant prices for their GPUs and chips, margins are gonna shrink.\n\n2. Mag7 Capex investments mean multiple companies are going to be coming up with their own chips, while Nvidia still hold the performance lead on theirs, others like AMD could catch up in the future. Furthermore, Microsofts newest quantum chip just knocked the expectations of commercially deploying quantum computing from a couple of decades to a couple of years. While they don't have the production ready yet, they have all the infrastructure online and ready. Nvidia's monopoly is coming to an end faster than we're expecting.\n\n3. Nvidia historically tends to fall on earnings, their previous 2 reports all led to a noticeable drop in share price, even though they were beating their main metrics by a long shot. \n\nWhat do you guys think is gonna happen post-earnings to Nvidia? I'm setting a pre-earnings target of about 145$. Eager to hear what you guys think. ",

Note that xAI uses NVDA GPU's specifically in their super computer.\n\n**Catalyst/Sector Context:** We've seen a very strong recovery since the Deepseek fears caused a selloff. Personally I don't think xAI will cause the same effect that Deepseek did, but I think that the semis are a winner of this again.\n\n**Risks:** Unverified performance claims may lead to skepticism among investors and potential customers, impacting adoption rates and market trust. XAI has a \u201cColossus supercomputer,\u201d for training AI, which it said last year was utilizing a cluster of 100,000 advanced Nvidia GPUs for AI training.\n\nToday, the company revealed that it doubled the size of its GPU cluster for the training of Grok 3.\n\n**Related Tickers:** ARM, AMD, INTC\n\n**Offhand Comments:** May see reversal of news if performance doesn't match claims.\n\n**Ticker:** [**HEES (Herc Holdings Inc.)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=HEES&p=d)\n\n**Catalyst:** HEES has confirmed a $105 per share acquisition offer from Herc Rentals, surpassing the previous $92 per share bid from United Rentals.\n\n**Technicals:** Watching $100 level. They've accepted the bid so we might see trading closer to that bid price in the near future.\n\n**Catalyst/Sector Context:** Equipment rental industry is witnessing consolidation due to decelerating growth since 2023 (other than that nothing explosive)\n\n**Risks:** The bidding war may escalate acquisition costs, potentially leading to overvaluation and financial strain for the acquiring company.\n\n**Related Tickers:** URI, HRI\n\n**Ticker:** [**NKE (Nike Inc)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NKE&p=d)\n\n**Catalyst:** Nike has announced a new brand collaboration with SKIMS, launching a line called NikeSKIMS.\n\n**Technicals:** Watching $75 level.\n\n**Catalyst/Sector Context:** SKIMS is pretty popular- mainly does underwear/loungewear/shapewear but this might be more focused on athleisure. This could potentially make a difference in NKE sales- SKIMS also collaborated with The North Face in the past, so worth keeping track of this for future catalysts in case they work with other brands.\n\n**Related Tickers:** LULU, UAA\n\n**Tickers:** [**LMT (Lockheed Martin )**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=LMT&p=d)**/**[**GD (General Dynamics )**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=GD&p=d)**/**[**RTX (Raytheon)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=RTN&p=d)\n\n**Catalyst:** Unconfirmed reports suggest that President Trump plans to demand $500 billion from Ukraine and seek U.S. control over the country's mineral resources.\n\nThese claims have not been reported by major U.S. news outlets but have appeared in international media (from India, Canada, UK)\n\n**Technicals:** This catalyst has been \"semi-leaked\" for the past week but not \"fully confirmed\", but we would likely see a selloff in defense stocks if true.\n\n**Catalyst/Sector Context:** These companies would go to the downside from an end to the Ukraine war, and spike if talks aren't successful.\n\n**Risks:** Pretty much a \"wait for the news announcement\" kind of trade, pretty straightforward.\n\n**Related Tickers:** BA, NOC, HAL\n\n**Ticker:** [**BIDU (Baidu)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=BIDU&p=d)\n\n**Catalyst:** BIDU earnings with an EPS of \u00a519.18 vs \u00a514.13.

Additionally, as automated production scales up, there could be a secondary surge in demand for embedded systems, potentially benefiting companies like AMD and Intel.\n\nWhile this outlook remains speculative, current trends in automation, robotics, and AI suggest that a U.S.-focused, high-tech manufacturing base could provide a strong competitive advantage in the global economy by 2025 and beyond.\n\nThis is my Thesis why I think Nationalism is a great priority to have now, because the countries with this infrastructure will win, just like the US won after World War II.\n\nEdit: Yikes, I see you do not have the capacity to look past the word Trump. Okay, my mistake, I forgot we are all hyper sensitive here. \n\nMy main Argument: Tariffs -> Increased Incentive for Moving Manufacturing Jobs into US -> Good for Automation Revolution -> Good for US economy over next 10+ years.  \n\nI can't comment on all the false statements being spammed in the comments by liberals, but I have no arguments for or against Trump, as a person, or any previous president, not worth my time and effort.

Elliott is believed to push the company to spin off or sell midstream opportunities.\n\n**Technicals:** We made a 6% move (just like when Elliott took a stake in BP), we may see another leg of movement during the day.\n\n**Risks:** Spinning off a segment reduces income diversification (at the possible benefit of having a higher valuation multiple), more of a long-term investment risk than a short term one. In the short-term, expect a ton of marginal headlines that will move the stock up/down 1% depending on how they want to make changes.\n\n**Related Tickers:** BP, XOM, CVX, MPC\n\n**Ticker:** [**LSCC (Lattice Semiconductor)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=LSCC&p=d)\n\n**Catalyst:** LSCC reported EPS of $0.15 vs. $0.19 expected. Revenue of $117.4 million vs. $117 million expected. Provided strong indication of improving customer consumption and stronger future demand.\n\n**Technicals:** Watching $65 level to the upside. Overall not interested in shorting this if I had to take a position.\n\n**Catalyst/Sector Context:** The semiconductor industry is signaling increased demand and increased spending across all companies, which is bullish obviously. Despite slightly missing EPS they signaled a good enough outlook that the stock reacted positively to Earnings. LSCC makes low power FPGAs.\n\n**Related Tickers:** NVDA, AMD, INTC, TXN\n\n**Ticker:** [**ASTS (AST SpaceMobile)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=ASTS&p=d)\n\n**Catalyst:** Following TMUS's announcement of compatibility with Starlink Beta, ASTS (a close competitor) experienced an 18% increase, with potential for further movement (both upside/downside) today, particularly around the $30 level.\n\n**Technicals:** I'm leaning more towards pullback today, watching $30 level.\n\n**Catalyst/Sector Context:** The satellite communications industry is rapidly evolving, with major players forming partnerships to expand global connectivity. Starlink is the biggest company out there, but ASTS moves whenever adoption news comes out, like it did previously with Verizon.\n\n**Risks:** Competition from entities like Starlink may pressure ASTS's market share and profitability in the future, especially when SpaceX is expected to IPO (eventually). Remember that ASTS has 5 satellites and is working on \\~19 more.\n\n**Offhand Comments:** The market's reaction underscores the \"adoption trade\", kind of like how all the weed stocks moved with each other.\n\n**Ticker:** [**PLTR (Palantir Technologies)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=PLTR&p=d)\n\n**Catalyst:** Nothing significant today, but we saw a huge spike up to $117.75 yesterday, likely from comments made during the Paris AI summit. Currently short.\n\n**Technicals:** Interested in $115 level as an add, on the short side. Watching $120 as the level to cover on.\n\n**Catalyst/Sector Context:** PLTR has made the mother of all moves recently, gaining 50% in the past 2 weeks. Most of that was from earnings,\n\n**Risks:** For a trade, I'm capping my risk at $120- everyone and their mother knows that PLTR is overvalued and run on hype at this point, and a move up to $100 from earnings might be tolerable but adding an extra 15% on top of that is irrational (in my opinion). Obviously there's significant retail interest in this stock, so will have to be agile and cognizant of what they're thinking as stock moves around.\n\n**Related Tickers:** All AI related companies.\n\n**EARNINGS: SMCI, UPST, DASH, LYFT**",

Announces that profit could fall by $2B or more due to tariffs and lower EV demand.\n\n**Technicals:** Pretty much broke the $10 level it's been trading around since August, watching to see if it'll sell off more by the open. Highly/infinitely liquid.\n\n**Catalyst/Sector Context:** The entire automotive industry is challenged by tariffs.

    "selftext": "INTC is green on the day, which is extremely suspect given it's priced as a company with no moat, no product, no foundries, 50B in debt and no CEO.\n\nLet's start with addressing the rumors.\n\n* GlobalFoundries announced that [their CEO is stepping down in May](https://gf.com/gf-press-release/globalfoundries-announces-leadership-transition-to-drive-next-phase-of-growth/). He is to stay on as Executive Chairman.\n* A January Bloomberg report ([paywall](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-17/biden-s-chips-team-hands-off-52-billion-program-to-a-skeptical-trump)) suggests the two companies are considering a merger, but that the US won't allow it unless the UAE government gives up their 80% controlling stake in GF.\n* Dr. Thomas Caulfield is replacing Ahmed Yahia, which was installed by the UAE government just after the purchase to control their 80% interest. Why would they let go of their man unless they were getting ready to divest?\n* Company jets for GF, QCOM, INTC and Musk were all at Mar-a-Lago (source: dylan522p (SemiAnalysis) on X, which I can't link) just after the SemiAccurate article \"[Sources Say Intel Is An Acquisition Target](https://www.semiaccurate.com/2025/01/17/sources-say-intel-is-an-acquisition-target/)\".\n* Someone bought [$170M worth of INTC stock](https://i.imgur.com/LHzDkgp.png) yesterday after market, which is about the same number as Pat's performance-based compensation when he joined in 2021. (INTC's board might not want to surrender shares from their treasury at this price).\n* INTC and GF are both critical suppliers. In the words of CSIS: [Too Good to Lose: America\u2019s Stake in Intel](https://www.csis.org/analysis/too-good-lose-americas-stake-intel). (CSIS also has an amazing YouTube channel for policy discussions).\n\nNow for why everyone is wrong in thinking Intel is a bad company:\n\n* Their gamble to regain process superiority by developing five technology nodes in four years is paying off. Intel 3 is in HVM and 18A will by the end of the year. Yields are looking good and they even signed up Microsoft as a customer (meaning, some of that $80B MSFT capex for OpenAI inference is likely to go to 18A).\n* 18A is not only competitive, but market leading. TSMC doesn't have an answer to Intel's backside power delivery, and lower impedance = lower losses.\n* If you thought 18A was cool, wait until you learn about 14A. 18A is the stepping stone for the real high-volume money maker, 14A.\n* 14A is going to be manufactured on NA EUV machines, which TSMC doesn't even have. Again, Intel bought all of them for last year.\n* On the product side, we know from the current Lunar Lake CPUs (manufactured on TSMC 3N, a worse node than 18A), that is has [nothing to envy to AMD's offerings](https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/lunar-lake-allegedly-smokes-z1-extreme-handheld-gaming-champ-in-early-gaming-benchmarks).\n\nThe last point is, of course, tariffs, promised to be between 25% and 100%, to incentivize onshoring of chip manufacturing. They might be announced and not implemented for at least a year, to give time to the market to move to 18A/14A, but they are going to happen, as it's perfectly reasonable policy (have you seen those Chinese landing ships?).\n\nA lot of this content was taken from the r/intelstock subreddit, which I hope the mods are ok with me linking!\n\nLast here is a [comparision of process tecnologies](https://i.imgur.com/uLxrb8x.png) for TSMC (A16, 3N) and INTC (14A/18A).",

    "title": "Thinking about NVDA beyond 2025 Hyperscaler CapEx Growth",
    "selftext": "With 3/4 hyperscalers reporting earnings already, the reaction to Nvidia has been positive, but stock still trades less than before DeepSeek. I believe the sentiment is that while 2025 will be great, Nvidia is nearing the \"end of great times\" and moving to a \"just good times\".\n\n**Here's my take at a breakdown. I am not an expert, but have read a lot of positive and negative takes, I'm starting this thread to start a discussion not to pump the stock. Please don't comment \"Nvidia diamond hands durr\".**\u00a0I didn't use AI to write this sadly.\n\nI can't link out to some of the resources, but tried to describe them for easy search and find.\n\n**TLDR:**\u00a0Meeting 2025 revenue projections isn't at excessive risk based on CapEx raises so far. It's likely that production capacity may really be the limiting reagent for 2025 revenues not demand. Market is forward looking and there is uncertainity on 2026+ revenues (DeepSeek is one of them) - markets don't like that. However, uncertainity is an opportunity if Nvidia can deliver again - remember stocks climb a wall of worry.\n\n**Disclosure:**\u00a0Own a lot of NVDA. But have covered calls on them, so not a blindfold risktaker.\n\n**Personal take:**\u00a0NVDA is attractive at these levels, but I'd be cautious holding my entire position after the summer 2025 earnings calls from the hyperscalers, because if there's any indication there is a 2026 CapEx slowdown, stock could fall a lot. I can't predict the future, so diversification is important even if you like the stock.\n\nHowever, continued chip innovation that maintains a competitive advantage that leads to higher end customer ROIs compared to other chip alternatives would help. Also, release of one tangible AI product would change the sentiment and game here (e.g. Robotaxis, enterprise solutions used common place for F500 companies, etc). Many are already underway - my company is releasing Gemini for all employees - this goes beyond software engineers. I think diversification across the industry (AVGO, TSM, power producers) could be valuable as time progresses as the AI use case boom happens.\n\n\\-----------------------------------------\n\n**(1) Meeting 2025 Revenue projections isn't at excessive risk based on CapEx raises so far**\n\nBased on\u00a0[stockanalysis](https://stockanalysis.com/stocks/nvda/forecast/)\u00a0consensus 2024 to 2025 revenue growth is estimated to be 52%.\n\n1. MSFT: 55.7B in 2024 to 80B in 2025\n2. Google: 52.5B in 2024 to 75B in 2025\n3. Meta: 39B in 2024 to 60B - 60B in 2025\n\nBased on the numbers written above, the anticipated growth from hyperscaler capex spend is 46% (if we assume concentration of NVDA chip spend as percent of capex steady). Hyperscalers are estimated to be about 50% of Nvidia revenue. To reach the 52% target that means from the remainder of the revenue book, Nvidia needs 58% spend increase.\n\nThis doesn't seem unreasonable.\u00a0**Potential**\u00a0investments through StarGate (Oracle), OpenAI's increasingly independent spending funded by Softbank, and sovereign AI investments are a tailwind to that figure. However, sustained export controls (e.g. Biden's global export framework) and increased crackdowns are headwinds.\n\n**(2) It's likely that production capacity may really be the limiting reagent for 2025 revenues not demand**\n\nBased on multiple\u00a0[sources](https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/nvidias-blackwell-gpus-are-sold-out-for-the-next-12-months-chipmaker-to-gain-market-share-in-2025?utm_source=chatgpt.com), seems like Blackweel is sold out for the next 12 months anyways. So 2025 revenues may be a matter of strong production. Moreover, from the commentary that google had on their earnings call - seems like cloud growth is supply constrained by infrastructure rather than demand constrained. I believe for 2025 at least customers will buy as many NVIDIA chips as they can and its production that determines valuation.\n\nSince the market is forward looking, 2025 revenue misses won't be as crucial as addressing the question of when is the demand going to slow down and the AI semiconductor sales from NVDA slowdown?\n\n**(3) Market is forward looking and there is uncertainity on 2026+ revenues (DeepSeek is one of them)..markets don't like that**\n\nNo matter how you slice it, DeepSeek has provided true software driven advances that more efficiently use Nvidia GPUs and non-NVDA GPUs on the training and particularly inference level. You can look at the cost per inference token for DeepSeek vs. OpenAI. It has raised questions on the sustainability on needing cutting edge chips at high margins in the long run. Risks below.\n\n* **Do closed loop models even have a moat over open source?**: Can closed-loop/proprietary LLMs develop models that demand a strong ROI justifying investment in more chips to\u00a0**train**\u00a0better models that\u00a0**end users are willing to pay for**? Currently Sam Altman & Dario (Antropic) think compute is the way to go. However, at some point they could discover more compute for training =/= better or more efficient models.\n* **Training:**\u00a0Efficiencies in hardware utilization may reduce Nvidia's moat in interconnectivity and lead to better training advances, which could reduce margins if other chips are \"somewhat as good\" eventually given demand equalizes to supply.\u00a0See point # 1 in this excellent recap here  (available by searching DeepSeek and the ramification on the AI industry: winners and losers? by Rihard Jarc)\n* **More use cases in a post training world could mean more inference on custom chips & competitor products:**\u00a0It is widely believed that Nvidia is more of an undisputed leader in training performance vs. inference. If open source models become good enough and training investments do not result in monetizable ROI, Nvidia's margins likely fall as custom chips and other semiconductor players provide good solutions.\u00a0[Jevon's Paradox (more use cases and usage)](https://www.npr.org/sections/planet-money/2025/02/04/g-s1-46018/ai-deepseek-economics-jevons-paradox)\u00a0is very likely here, but volume would have to increase signficantly to offset margin decreases - a risk that the market doesn't like.\n* **CUDA alternatives leads to market share loses?:**\u00a0CUDA is widely known to be the best option \"coding\" platform to get GPUs to do what you want right now.\u00a0[However, there are other applications coming out that allow fungible usage of other chips.\u00a0](https://www.theregister.com/2024/12/17/nvidia_cuda_moat/#:~:text=If%20you're%20doing%20low,AMD%20hardware%20%E2%80%93%20and%20vice%20versa)This reduces the need to use Nvidia chips and pay such high margins. There's drawbacks to not using CUDA that I'll highlight in section 4.\n\nSidenote - there is an\u00a0honest and excellent podcast on DeepSeek implications to Nvidia from Bankless w/ Jeffrey Emmanuel (whose blogpost got a lot of investors interested in DeepSeek impact over 2 weekends ago). Please listen.\n\n**(4) However, uncertainity is an opportunity if Nvidia can deliver again - remember stocks climb a wall of worry.**\n\n* **Early innings of the AI story:**\u00a0Models are going to get more complex not stagnate. This requires more training compute as we try to reach AGI level models. On the inference front, as more use cases explode, there will be more general chip demand. We haven't even seen full released use cases in robotics, autonomous transit, healthcare AI, etc.\n* **CUDA is the lowest latency**\u00a0and provides best performance as of now. There might be a technical limit to how well alternatives perform.\n* **Cost of being last**\u00a0in AI is too great for hyperscalers\n* **Continued innovation leadership:**\u00a0Nvidia has expedited it's semiconductor cycle from 2 years to 1 year. Rubin (next gen AI chips) are already being worked on. Semiconductors are known to be cylical, but this may dull any trough cycle.\n* **Increased soverign AI investments**\u00a0(StarGate, Middle east, etc.)\n* **Ridiculous cash flow with minimal R&D**\u00a0as % of revenue means that Nvidia can invest in strategic ventures, emerging tech, and adjacent spaces to diversify revenue streams.

Revenue of $7.66 billion vs. $7.5 billion expected. Ultimately said that data center segment revw will be down in Q1, but had clear positive outlook in 2025 and expected double digit revenue growth. This was what caused the stock to fall despite the initial spike.\n\n**Technicals:** Watching $100 level, but doesn't seem to be an irrational move in my opinion. Note that we've moved from $150 to $107 in the past 3 months.\n\n**Risks:** The vast majority of NVDA/AMD/every semiconductor's business's money comes from selling to businesses- individual consumers are a tiny slice of the pie despite gaming/client businesses growing, so I don't really pay attention to them (one exception is NVDA'S 50 series GPUs selling out within 5 minutes) . We also have threats from NVDA dominance, possible regulations from the US, etc, (Disclaimer: I generally don't invest in AMD)\n\n**Related Tickers:** NVDA, INTC, QCOM\n\n**Offhand Comments:** Overall doesn't seem to have affected NVDA or other semis much because what they cited was weakness that was exclusive to them and not the broader semis market.\n\n**Ticker:** [**GOOG (Alphabet Inc.)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=GOOG&p=d)\n\n**Catalyst:** GOOG/GOOGL reported fourth-quarter 2024 earnings with an EPS of $2.12 vs. $2.12 expected. Revenue of $96.5 billion vs. $96.67 billion expected. Cited FAR more spending in CapEx and a miss in cloud revenue (which signals that other competitors have taken their market share)\n\n**Catalyst/Sector Context:** Market had a pretty negative reaction to the news that they'd be investing far more in capex and missed on cloud revenue (was roughly $9B vs $12B expected).\n\n**Risks:** Elevated capital spending may pressure Alphabet's margins if the capex spending doesn't result in increased revenue, especially amidst increasing competition in the AI and cloud markets. I don't really see the China investigation to affect their stock price much, Google Search and Youtube are blocked in China and I doubt that China is going to let Waymo operate in their cities rather than creating their own solution.\n\n**Related Tickers:** MSFT, META, MAG7\n\n**Ticker:** [**UPS (United Parcel Service)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=UPS&p=d)**,** [**FDX (FedEx Corporation)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=FDX&p=d)**,** [**PDD (Pinduoduo Inc.)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=PDD&p=d)\n\n**Catalyst:** The U.S. Postal Service has suspended accepting parcels from China and Hong Kong following new tariffs imposed by Trump, affecting logistics companies like UPS and FedEx.\n\n**Technicals:** I'm mainly interested in PDD because they own Temu, which focuses on shipping small/low-cost goods to the US and using the loophole for very low shipping costs.\n\n**Catalyst/Sector Context:** The recent suspension by USPS may lead to increased demand for private carriers like UPS and FedEx to handle parcels from China. There are a number of Chinese companies that focus on shipping low cost goods (like PDD).\n\n**Risks:** Heightened tariffs and trade barriers could disrupt supply chains, increase costs, and lead to potential overreliance on private carriers, which may face capacity constraints and regulatory scrutiny.\n\n**Related Tickers:** XPO\n\n**Ticker:** [**UBER (Uber Technologies)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=UBER&p=d)\n\n**Catalyst:** Uber reported fourth-quarter 2024 earnings with an EPS of $3.21 vs. $0.48 expected. Revenue of $12B vs. $11.8B expected. Cited that they plan to do buybacks of their own stock.\n\n**Technicals:** Watching $60 level, no bias.\n\n**Catalyst/Sector Context:** Despite Uber's strong quarterly performance, they cited a potential $1 billion impact from a strong U.S. dollar on future bookings which results in worse earnings overseas.\n\n**Risks:** Outside of self-driving cars (Uber partnered with Waymo to operate in Austin), currency fluctuations and international markets affect companies you wouldn't normally expect. This may move in future from tariff news.\n\n**Related Tickers:** LYFT\n\n**Ticker:** [**USO (United States Oil Fund)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=USO&p=d)**,** [**BP (BP)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=BP&p=d)**,** [**CVX (Chevron )**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=CX&p=d)**,** **Other Oil Stocks**\n\n**Catalyst:** Trump announced that the United States plans to take over the Gaza Strip, relocate its residents to neighboring countries, and redevelop the area.\n\n**Technicals:** USO didn't move much on this piece of news, but if Trump actually makes this a policy then we might see a LOT more volatility in the future depending on how serious we get and if we get involved again.\n\n**Catalyst/Sector Context:** The oil sector is sensitive to geopolitical developments in the Middle East, a region critical to global oil supply.

    "selftext": "Advanced Micro Devices reported fourth-quarter results on Tuesday that beat Wall Street expectations for sales and earnings, but the stock fell about 6% in extended trading as the company missed estimates in its key data center segment.\n\nHere\u2019s how the chipmaker did, versus LSEG consensus estimates for the quarter ended Dec. 28:\n\nEarnings per share: $1.09, adjusted, versus $1.08 expected\n\nRevenue: $7.66 billion versus $7.53 billion\n\nAMD said it expects $7.1 billion in sales in the first quarter, plus or minus $300 million. It projected its gross margin to be about 54%. Analysts expected AMD to guide for revenue of $7 billion.\n\nAMD reported $482 million in net income, or 29 cents per share, for the fourth quarter, down from $667 million, or 41 cents per share in the year-ago period.The company\u2019s adjusted earnings per share excluded items such as acquisition costs, inventory loss at contract manufacturers, and restructuring charges.\n\nSu told investors on an earnings call that AMD believes it will report \u201cstrong double-digit percentage revenue and EPS growth\u201d in 2025.\n\nThe company\u2019s most important unit is its business selling chips for data centers, which has been growing in recent quarters, thanks to demand for its graphics processing units for artificial intelligence.\n\nAMD reported $3.86 billion in data center sales, which was up 69% on a year-over-year basis. The company said the increase was due to sales both in its Instinct GPUs and its EPYC CPUs, which compete with Intel\u2019s processors.\n\nHowever, analysts polled by FactSet were predicting $4.14 billion in data center sales during the quarter.\n\nFor the full year, AMD\u2019s data center division revenue increased 94% to $12.6 billion. AMD said that $5 billion of those sales were from its Instinct GPUs for AI.\n\nWhile AMD is far behind market leader Nvidia, it\u2019s released competitive data center GPUs in recent years such as the MI300X, that some big infrastructure buyers, including Meta and Amazon, have embraced.\n\n\u201cWe believe this places AMD on a steep long-term growth trajectory, led by the rapid scaling of our data center AI franchise from more than $5 billion of revenue in 2024 to tens of billions of dollars of annual revenue over the coming years,\u201d Su said on the earnings call with analysts.\n\nAMD categorizes its chips for PCs, laptops, and other individual computers as client revenue, which increased 58% on an annual basis to $2.3 billion. AMD said both its chips for desktops as well as mobile computers such as laptops are seeing strong demand.\n\nAMD is also the second-largest producer of GPUs for gaming, behind Nvidia. Revenue in the segment declined 59% to $563 million. The company\u2019s other small division, embedded chips, reported $923 million in sales, down 13% year-over-year.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/04/amd-earnings-report-q4-2024.html",

Tariffs on Mexico/Canada are delayed, but we still have tariffs on China, and tariffs have been promised by Trump on the EU.\n\nNews: [As Trump Tariffs Take Effect, China Retaliates With Trade Measures Against U.S.](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/02/04/us/trump-tariffs-news?unlocked_article_code=1.uU4.ps2-.DRzgfM1GnN9i)\n\n**Ticker:** [**PLTR (Palantir Technologies Inc)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=PLTR&p=d)\n\n**Catalyst:** Reported earnings of $0.14 vs. $0.11 expected. Revenue of $828 million vs. $777 million expected. Management highlighted the power of AI and their sizable contracts, citing the nature of the AI war being winner-take-all.\n\n**Technicals:** PLTR absolutely exploded and hit $102 premarket, currently watching $100 level to see if we continue the move. Other than that unlikely to be trading this unless we have massive volume come in.\n\n**Catalyst/Sector Context:** The PLTR ER highlighted the growing demand for AI-driven solutions across government/commercial sectors. Company emphasized securing substantial contracts in the competitive AI landscape, important because they are more closely aligned with the current government.\n\n**Risks:** Obviously being more closely tied to the government means that it has more leeway to be more monopolistic/aggresive in their actions, Alex Karp and Peter Thiel are closely aligned with current government leaders.\n\n**Related Tickers:** MSFT, GOOGL, IBM, AMZN\n\n**Ticker:** [**NVDA (NVIDIA Corporation)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&p=d)\n\n**Catalyst:** Chinese AI company DeepSeek is reportedly preparing to switch to domestic GPUs to circumvent NVDA chip restrictions. DeepSeek has bypassed NVDA CUDA for certain operations, utilizing the PTX (Parallel Thread Execution) language instead. Additionally, on February 2nd, DeepSeek, in collaboration with SiliconFlow and Huawei Cloud, launched DeepSeek-R1/V3 inference services on Huawei's Ascend AI chips. Huawei is also promoting its new Ascend AI processors to Chinese groups considering \"inference\" as an option.\n\n**Technicals:** After the insane move we've seen from $150 to $118, I actually don't consider this to be earth shattering news- China has always been trying to develop their own semis and not using NVDA for training is what they were \"supposed\" to be doing due to the trade restrictions. I'm still long but selling calls against my position, recovery might be slow for NVDA. It's interesting that they are attempting to bypass CUDA, which is essentially the \"standard\" for ML/AI training nowadays on NVDA chips and developing their own.\n\n**Catalyst/Sector Context:** DeepSeek's move to adopt domestic GPUs and bypass CUDA indicates they're aiming for technological self-reliance amidst U.S. export restrictions, rather than trying to adopt more NVDA chips (which presumably isn't a viable long term strategy).\n\n**Risks:** Nvidia faces potential revenue loss if Chinese companies increasingly adopt domestic GPUs and alternative programming frameworks. The effectiveness of U.S. export controls may be undermined as Chinese firms develop workarounds.\n\n**Related Tickers:** AMD, INTC, QCOM, TSM\n\n**Ticker:** [**BABA**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=BABA&p=d)**/(oil stocks, car stocks, etc).**\n\n**Catalyst:** U.S. implemented a 10% tariff on all Chinese imports, aiming to address issues related to drug trafficking, particularly fentanyl. In response, China announced retaliatory tariffs effective February 10, including a 15% tariff on U.S. coal and liquefied natural gas, and a 10% tariff on crude oil, agricultural machinery, and large-engine vehicles.\n\n**Catalyst/Sector Context:** The imposition of these tariffs marks a significant escalation in U.S.-China trade tension and more volatility to come through Trump tweets- we might see a trade war again (sigh) like we did in 2019. Not 100% sure if agricultural machinery will affect stocks like DE but will look into it.\n\n**Related Tickers:** JD, BIDU, TCEHY, PDD\n\n**Offhand Comments:** There are going to be retaliation investigations against companies operating in America, INTC and GOOG have recently been announced as under investigation by China. But it's very important to remember which companies have a presence in China and which don't- for example, GOOG search hasn't worked in China since 2010 lol.\n\n**Ticker:** [**GRAB (Grab Holdings Limited)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=GRAB&p=d)\n\n**Catalyst:** Grab Holdings Ltd. is considering a takeover of its Indonesian rival, GoTo Group, at a valuation of approximately $7 billion.\n\n**Technicals:** Watching $5 level, no bias. I'm not 100% sure if there's an actual \"acquisition\" share price for GoTo but will keep eyes peeled for that acquisition premium.\n\n**Catalyst/Sector Context:** The potential merger represents a significant consolidation in SEA's ride-hailing and food delivery sectors. Mergers typically streamline operations and reduce competition, leading to improved profitability for the combined entity.\n\n**Risks:** The proposed merger may face regulatory hurdles, including antitrust concerns, which could delay or derail the deal.

    "title": "The case for Intel from a former Bear-Updated with Tariff News",
    "selftext": "Six months ago, I posted this DD:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1e1w8a8/the_case_for_intel_from_a_former_bear/?ref=share&ref_source=link\n\nI thought I might offer an update on developments since then\u2014where I was wrong, where I was right, and how the stock might develop in my more humble opinion. TLDR: Tariffs\u2014skip to the end.\n\nI posted the original DD before the August 35% drop. I have continued buying, lowering my average price to $29 a share.\n\nWhere I Was Wrong\n\nClearly, the new products did not inflect Intel's earnings higher in Q4, and the Q1 guide was disappointing. Arrow Lake has been a dud in the desktop space. Lunar Lake, while being a very good part, just doesn't carry the margins I had hoped. Granite Rapids, while closing the gap significantly with AMD compared to prior products, is less competitive than I had hoped compared to AMD's new-gen Turin.\n\nThe shift from CPU to GPU has been more brutal than I anticipated (clearly, AMD's stock price is also reflecting this reality). Intel has also pushed Clearwater Forest back by about a quarter (from late 2025 to more likely late Q1/early Q2 2026) due to packaging yield issues.\nPat was also fired\u2014but not for the reasons I would have expected. Falcon Shores AI GPU was canceled, but I had zero expectations for that anyway.\n\nWhat's Going Right and What Might Inflect the Stock\n\nSince the drop, Intel now trades at tangible book value\u2014that\u2019s essentially all cash and hard assets (excluding IP, brand, etc.), minus debts. So if the company shut down today, shareholders should get roughly $20 per share in cash after everything is sold. That puts a floor on the downside and makes it a likely takeover target if it falls further.\n\nIntel\u2019s 18A remains on track, which is the linchpin of any long-term investment in the company. We now have more clarity that it fits squarely between TSMC's 3nm and 2nm nodes. Yields are good, and they are installing tools in their Arizona fab. You don\u2019t buy and install billions in equipment if the node is failing.\nPanther Lake, their laptop CPU, remains on track to launch in Q4 of this year and will carry 60% gross margins (compared to 40% for Lunar Lake) while being manufactured in-house in the USA.\n\nIntel Foundry is beginning to climb out of the hole this year, as I predicted in my original post. Just to put things into perspective, Intel\u2019s 7nm node was designed so poorly for cost that its cost structure is similar to TSMC\u2019s 3nm node and even to the upcoming 18A node. As 7nm wafers ramp down and EUV nodes like 18A ramp up, losses will shrink. For example, 18A carries a 3x selling price compared to Intel 7. Overall, outsourcing to TSMC will peak this year at 30% of wafers.\n\nThis process will be slow, so I would not expect any single quarter to make you go wow! Instead, I expect lumpy but improving quarters throughout the year. I originally anticipated a one-two punch, but it's more likely to be a grind until late 2026, when Intel will have strong products (Diamond Rapids, Clearwater Forest, and Nova Lake).\n\nThe Black Swan Event\u2014Tariffs\n\nHowever, there is a potential black swan event for current bagholders and potential investors.\nI would not buy the stock based on the possibility of tariffs, but it's a large opportunity should it happen.\nTrump, on 1/28 and today (1/31), reiterated that he plans to impose tariffs on chips and specifically singled out Taiwan, saying, \"You know, Taiwan, they stole our chip business,\" and claiming that 98% of chips are made in Taiwan. We are here to make money\u2014not be political.\n\nI often see many TSMC investors not fully understanding what they own. TSMC\u2019s Arizona fab is planned to produce 20k 4nm wafers per month. Right now, TSMC is producing 125,000 3nm wafers per month in Taiwan and 150,000 5nm wafers per month in Taiwan. Their 3nm fab in Arizona won\u2019t be ready until 2028.\nSo, U.S. production will account for only ~7% of TSMC\u2019s leading-edge capacity\u2014and by the end of next year, they will already be producing 2nm in Taiwan, further reducing that percentage.\n\nUltimately, fabs take years to build, so this dynamic won\u2019t change for at least four years.\nIf tariffs happen, Intel will begin to report a surge in customer interest and prepayments as companies rush to secure dramatically cheaper wafers. Intel would not have enough capacity to serve the entire industry, so someone will be left bag-holding a product that\u2019s 25-50% more expensive.\nThis would dramatically change sentiment, though revenue from these deals would start kicking in around 2026-2028.\n\nThere is also a dynamic between AMD and Intel with TSMC tariffs, but that\u2019s still too speculative to dive into at this point.\n\nThere are a lot of technical nuances to this situation\u2014like 18A not being amazing for mobile (18AP will help close the gap next year), and how quickly companies can port IP. But ultimately, necessity is the mother of invention, and cost differences will drive change.",

Tim Cook mentioned that Apple Intelligence DID lead to stronger sales/growth in areas where it was rolled out (it has limited rollout right now).\n\nVolume/Market Cap/Technicals: Watching $250 level, no strong bias. We've seen AAPL swing close to 20% this month, (on report of sales weakness in China) but doubt this will continue.\n\nContext: Most immediate news that comes to mind was the weakness of sales in China for the iPhone, causing the move this month.\n\nRisks: Don't really see immediate risks beyond the trade war, in 2019/2020 this resulted in AAPL moving manufacturing/production to other countries in South East Asia- slowing growth in China has been pretty consistent, however.\n\nRelated Tickers: rest of FAANG, Samsung if you can trade overseas stocks, the various phone component manufacturers that trade with AAPL\n\nOffhand: Apple is investing in its own high-speed network infrastructure to enhance content delivery, (just like META's undersea pipeline)\n\nTicker: [ACMR (ACM Research, Inc.)](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=ACMR&p=d)\n\nCatalyst: Kerrisdale Capital released a bullish report on ACM Research (ACMR), a semiconductor wafer fabrication equipment (WFE) company positioned in China but headquartered in America.\n\nIt leads China as a leading supplier of wafer cleaning tools and beneficiary of China's push toward semiconductor self-sufficiency.\n\nKerrisdale predicts the company to eventually compete globally and cites it as a potential 10x return. Trades at 1x 2025E revenue (likely due to China fears).\n\nVolume/Market Cap/Technicals: This is the interesting part- ACMR holds a $1.2B mkt cap but trades at a massive discount compared to its Chinese subsidiary (ACMS), which has a $5.9 billion market cap and trades at 6x 2025E revenue.\n\nThe report suggests that ACMR\u2019s NASDAQ valuation is severely mispriced and could re-rate significantly as investors recognize the valuation gap.\n\nContext: China/US chip war, you guys know what this is.\n\nSector Context: The global semiconductor industry is shifting, with China attempting to localize chip production.\n\nKerrisdale argues that restrictions on U.S. and Japanese WFE exports to China will only fuel ACMR\u2019s growth as Chinese fabs increasingly turn to domestic suppliers.\n\nChina's WFE self-sufficiency has grown from 4% in 2019 to 17% in 2024 and is expected to reach 36% by 2026.\n\nRisks: Geopolitical factors, including further U.S. export restrictions, could impact ACMR\u2019s operations. Similar to how we have the NVDA trade restriction going on right now. However, Kerrisdale sees these restrictions as a net positive due to ACMR having less competition in China as a result.

Most important, the company anticipated breakeven EPS next quarter.\n\nVolume/Market Cap/Technicals: Somewhat rangebound for the past 3 months. Watching $20 but nothing interesting I'm watching beyond that.\n\nContext: This earnings report is Intel's first since the departure of CEO Pat Gelsinger. Right now INTC is being led by two interim co-CEOs, and another price catalyst that could potentially happen is someone competent being picked lol. Also worth thinking of the NVDA/Deepseek/semiconductor news when reading through these catalysts.\n\nIntel has also announced a delay in its Falcon Shores GPU and only using it internally within the company.\n\nRisks: Intel faces significant competition from companies such as NVIDIA and AMD, the delay of their chip is pretty bad news.\n\nRelated Tickers: AMD/NVDA/TSM\n\nTicker: [ASTS](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=ASTS&p=d)\n\nCatalyst: ASTS has received special temporary authority from the FCC to test its space-based cellular broadband network in the United States. Allows for collaboration efforts with VZ/T.\n\nVolume/Market Cap/Technicals: Slight rise, but will watch this at open to see if volume comes in.\n\nContext: The FCC's authorization allows ASTS to provide cell/satellite comms, allowing for greater coverage and signals that more use of ASTS satellites. I remember that the company was essentially valued based on each satellite they launched successfully in 2024, whether that hype returns remains to be seen but overall not interested in trading this unless we have retail interest again.\n\nSector Context: SpaceX's Starlink is also entering the direct-to-cell market, as I noted a few days ago- most of the investment that can be done in these type of cell/sat comms in public markets can really only be done in ASTS.\n\nRisks: If SpaceX IPOs we might see a selloff in this stock simply because SpaceX is far larger/established and Elon Musk has closer ties to the government.\n\nRelated Tickers: T/VZ/RKLB",

    "selftext": "Intel's (INTC.O), opens new tab first-quarter revenue forecast on Thursday missed analyst estimates, as the chipmaker grapples with tepid demand for traditional data center chips and declining share in the key personal computer market.\n\nShares of the Santa Clara, California-based company fell close to 2% in volatile extended trading. Last year, Intel's shares lost about 60%.\n\nAs the chipmaker undergoes a historic transition and attempts to emerge from one of its bleakest periods, it has also struggled to cash in on a boom in investment in advanced AI chips - a market led by Nvidia.\n\nIn its quarterly report after the bell, Intel said it expects first-quarter revenue of $11.7 billion to $12.7 billion, compared with analysts' average estimate of $12.87 billion according to data compiled by LSEG.\n\nCompanies looking to capitalize on generative AI technology have prioritized spending on specialized AI processors that can churn huge amounts of data, crimping demand for the traditional server processors that Intel sells.\n\nThe company's outlook \"reflects seasonal weakness magnified by macro uncertainties, further inventory digestion and competitive dynamics,\" interim co-CEO and chief financial officer David Zinsner said in a statement.\n\nIntel last year scrapped a 2024 forecast that it would sell over $500 million worth of its new AI processors, named Gaudi, suggesting they struggled to compete against Nvidia's chips.\n\nOn an adjusted, per-share basis, Intel forecast it would break-even for the current quarter. Analysts expect adjusted profit of 9 cents per share.\n\nIt is spending heavily to become a contract manufacturer of chips for other companies, leading some investors to worry about pressure on its cash flows.\n\nFormer CEO Pat Gelsinger was ousted last month, leaving two temporary co-CEOs at the helm and shrouding Intel's turnaround strategy in uncertainty.\n\nIntel reported fourth-quarter revenue fell 7% from a year earlier to $14.26 billion, beating estimates of $13.81 billion.\n\nThe PC market - Intel's largest by revenue share - saw global shipments rise only modestly last year, underperforming analysts' expectations of a strong rebound after months of declines.\n\nThe company has also been losing share in the PC and server CPU market to rival AMD.\n\nhttps://www.reuters.com/technology/intel-forecasts-first-quarter-revenue-below-estimates-2025-01-30/",

    "selftext": "This is a daily watchlist for short-term trading: I might trade all/none of the stocks listed, and even stocks not listed!\n\nI am targeting potentially good candidates for short-term trading; I have no opinion on them as investments.\n\nThe potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting, everything else is secondary.\n\n**Today OpenAI may make history. Trying out longer form, more detailed catalyst examinations over the short-form with more tickers.**\n\n**Ticker:** [**META (Meta Inc)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=META&p=d)\n\n**Catalyst:** Reported earnings of $8.02 vs $6.68 expected. Revenue of $48.4B vs $47B,but guided revenue short of consensus and didn't provide FY25 revenue outlook (which triggered the reason for the selloff post-earnings after the close).\n\nTheir CAPEX announcement was $60-65B vs $52.4B expected, and stated they expected the single largest driver of expesive growth in 2025 as infrastructure costs due to higher OpEX and depreciation.\n\nAlso announced plans to grow META's AI team significantly.\n\n**Volume/Market Cap/Technicals:** Earnings move the stock on far less volume but the initial selloff after announcement was worth trading- interested in the $700 level today but not much beyond that.\n\n**Context:** Decent earnings but signals that there is more spending on the horizon- likely that the initial brutal selloff to $606 was from algos just reading the initial eye-popping CAPEX number and selling the company.\n\n**Sector Context:**There is a major next-level breakthrough that OpenAI is expected to release today that has agents performing on the same level as PHDs, Altman is meeting today with US government officials. META is the creator of Llama, which is another open source model compared to OpenAI's closed models.\n\n**Risks:** Deepseek has been the main threat involved, with competitors from China using distillation and other AI techniques to be able to train a far cheaper model that brings up the question of why our large tech firms are spending so much on GPUs. (I'm sure this is news to you /s)\n\n**Related Tickers:** FAANG stocks, SNAP, PINS, etc.\n\nOffhand:  Something worth remembering is that there is a $10B undersea cable that spans over 40K km that they plan to build (unknown what the cable is for), more details coming in 2025. Likely some kind of fiber optic cable.\n\n**Ticker:** [**TSLA (Tesla Inc.)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TSLA&p=d)\n\n**Catalyst:** Reported earnings of $0.73 vs $0.76 expected. Revenue of $25.71B vs $27.23B expected. Most of this revenue miss came from miss in sale of EVs. \n\nTSLA announced interesting plans to lower the price of EVs in 2025 but also didn't give specific details regarding the production volume targets (as they have in the past), and also announced that there would be a paid robotaxi service in Austin in June. This puts them in competition with Waymo/UBER. Personally I think the vision-only approach is not viable in the long-run but hey, I'm no self-driving PHD. \n\nCAPEX was ALSO higher as with META due to spending increases from AI training infra costs and battery production capacity.\n\n**Volume/Market Cap/Technicals:** I'm mainly interested in the $375/$400 level, not too interested in going long despite the multi-day slide in price.\n\n**Context:** Main reason for TSLA's selloff was the lack of full-year guidance (it gives the subtext that it's too bad to release publically or it's up in the air). Political statements made by Musk may contribute to future issues for TSLA.\n\n**Sector Context:** Revenue shortfall was caused due to lower-than-expected vehicle deliveries/ increased sale incentives, 496K cars vs 507K exp. China's BYD is rapidly catching up, and the (possible) removal of the US EV tax credit may make EV's more expensive\n\n**Risks:** Mainly geopolitical- if the tariffs on EV vehicles imported to the US gets removed, TSLA will face fiercer competition from BYD. Also Elon Musk.\n\n**Related Tickers:** BYD (but mainly trades in China, TSLA isn't as impacted by AI news.)\n\n\n\n[**NVDA (NVIDIA Corporation) (in addition to ARM/AMD/SMH/SOXL/semiconductor stocks)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&p=d)\n\n**Catalyst:** The reveal of Deepseek has introduced an AI model that rivals existing solutions but was developed at around $6M. However there's a rumor that Deepseek is actually trained on 50K H100 NVDA gpus.\n\n**Yesterday after the close, there was an announcement Trump officials discussing tightening curbs on Nvidia's China sales.**\n\n**Volume/Market Cap/Technicals:** Overall, there's been a massive selloff since NVDA was $150 at the end of last week. Overall interested again if we hit $116, but low confidence we'll sell off again. \n\nCurrently long.\n\n**Sector Context:** Not much to really say about this beyond NVDA having the most advanced chips that are widespread for training because of the CUDA architecture- most people are doubtful that the TOTAL cost was $6M\n\nUS Officials are examining export restrictions but China will likely find a way to bypass them as they have previously.\n\n**Risks:** Mainly geopolitical, again. Obviously it's very difficult to restrict trade to a country that we have no military presence in or surround, and China is economically far more powerful than those we have attempted trade restrictions on in the past.\n\n**Related tickers:** (Mentioned above)\n\n**Earnings today:** AAPL, INTC, V,TEAM",

They underperformed the S&P500 (before their fee), and almost all positions are just S&P500 companies anyways, so I figured if I went 100% into an S&P index on my own I can't do worse.\n\nI'm not sure how best to proceed with the current number of individual stocks. There are 64 positions total and it's unrealistic that I'll be able to keep track of the performance/trajectory of that many companies. Buffet's \"pick a few winners\" comes to mind. I've been assuming the best thing to do is to slowly liquidate the one's I don't have a specific interest in, and buy VOO/SPY in their place.\n\nThere are many companies that I like and would like to hold on to (AAPL, AMD, AMZN, BRKB, GOOGL, JNJ, KO, MSFT, NVDA, NFLX, PG). However, the majority are S&P 500 companies that I don't follow closely (ABT, ADBE, AMAT, AMGN, AMT, AVGO, AZN, BA, BMY, CAT, COP, CRM, CVX, ... to name a few). It's not that I don't know those companies, but it feels ignorant to hold onto them knowing that I won't have time to monitor their performance.\n\nIs there a best way to go about liquidating those and moving into an S&P 500 index?

When it comes to indexes, celebrate the dip and buy, absolutely.\n\n*It's a guaranteed recovery as long as a world war doesn't break out and destroy America (we Canadians are ready to check off more of the Geneva checklist if you Yanks try anything funny).* /s \n\nBut for individual stocks? No. The story is different. AI may or may not be a bubble, but it's objectively true that some companies have profited greatly off of their AI investments while others have only made performative moves and have yet to see any real profit.\n\nQuantum computing is another hot area worth mentioning. So many people are tempted to chase what is an obvious bubble. As Jensen Huang said, we aren't even close. It's just gambling at this point, even if a 40% dip makes you feel like you have a \"margin of safety.\" \n\nPeople have gotten used to infinite V movements. There was a guy in the daily thread for months pointing out how every dip was immediately bought back up. This is not always the case, as we're seeing now. There's no guarantee that a stock will return to ATHs, even if it's one of our beloved bluechips. \n\nBut just because something is now lower in price does not make it \"on sale.\" If a banana used to be $100 and is now $50, would you buy it? No! That's still an outrageous price. Find some 10 cent kiwis instead. \n\nObligatory AMD comment: yes it was $200. No that price likely wasn't justified. I can't say whether the current price is good or bad, but with a narrow moat and poor performance in a historical semi/data centre run, it's been disappointing. It could absolutely skyrocket again, but that is not promised to you. For many, it is only now approaching a fair value, and for others it needs to dip below 100 or even less to reach that point. Despite being almost 50% from its ATH, it may still just be a $50 banana! \n\nAnyway, I hope this saves some of you from buying bad companies just because they are down. Be careful out there!\n\n\n\n ",

    "title": "Intel currently represents one of the best stock opportunities for 2025",
    "selftext": "Disclaimer: I am not a bagholder. I recently entered a position with a big part of my portfolio. I like to look at stocks where I think the market is mispricing risks and opportunities. I called for buying Alphabet in this sub in September and see a similar opportunity here (although not quite as strong).\n\n1. Intel is currently trading at 10-20% below its own book value. This does not yet say anything about possible growth options, but it does limit the possible downside potential because it makes takeovers increasingly realistic. Remember the many interested parties when Intel was last at $19.\n\n2. Cleaning up a common myth. Before I looked into Intel and I only heard about constantly crashing stock prices and bad news flow, I thought Intel was on the verge of insolvency. But that is not the case. Intel has a debt-to-equity ratio that is quite healthy and continues to generate 50 billion in revenue per year. With a conservative profit margin of 20% (below the historical average), Intel would make 10 billion euros in profit, giving it a PE of 8 at the current share price.\n\n3. Pat Gelsinger's departure is definitely linked to a neglect of the product line. Without Foundry, Intel Products would have made a profit of $3.4 billion in the last quarter alone despite its current poor product range. Even if 18A fails and Intel spins off Foundry, the company is the opposite of dead. By comparison, when AMD spun off Global Foundries in 2009, the share price jumped 20% on the day of the announcement and tripled over the course of the year. Chip manufacturing is a very thankless business. That is why TSMC has a monopoly in the manufacturing of the most modern semiconductors that was only built up with state support.\n\n4. Intel's improving CPU lineup, driven by the Lunar Lake and Arrow Lake chips, positions it well for a recovery in the PC and server markets. The first Panther Lake chips, which are to be produced on Intel's 18A, are already in initial testing at the OEM. These chips are to be released in the second half of 2025 and 70% produced in Intel's own factories, which could heavily increase margins.\u00a0 I don't want to sugarcoat anything. The last year was very difficult for Intel. First, there were stability issues with Raptor Lake CPUs, which even led to a lawsuit against the company. Then the new Core Ultra Desktop CPUs disappointed, proving efficient but in some cases even lagging behind the performance of the previous chip generation in gaming. But Intel still holds between 60-70% of the global CPU market. AMD's CPUs perform particularly well in gaming, and the switch from Intel to AMD is currently taking place primarily in the niche market of self-built PCs. In the OEM market, Intel continues to dominate massively because AMD cannot provide the quantity of chips needed and the focus here is on factors where Intel still at least matches AMD.\n\n5. The B580. While the pure specifications of the new Intel Battlemage graphics card are nothing special, they have received very positive feedback from a large number of reviewers, precisely because of their very low price, and are currently sold out almost everywhere. The B580 and upcoming graphics cards won't change Intel's bottom line for the time being, but the rapid and extremely good development over just 2 generations shows me that Intel's innovative spirit has not yet died.\n\n6. Let's now turn to 18A and the opportunities that come with it. While the departure of Gelsinger has raised doubts about the success of 18A, all the latest published news indicates that 18A is on the right track. The process currently has a defect density of 0.4 defects per square centimetre, which is only slightly worse than the TSMC benchmarks of 0.33 defects on the older N7 and N5 nodes at comparable development stages \u2013 about a year before entering mass production. Since the standard for this development stage is usually below 0.5 defects per square centimetre, this means that Intel could well be within industry standards for advanced nodes and should be sufficient to achieve viable yields. So, if we are to believe the ex-CEO and the current interim CEOs, we have nothing to worry about here.\n\n7. Should Trump also impose tariffs on Taiwan, Intel won't even have to be the best player anymore, because with a snap of the fingers, its foundry business will be 20% cheaper than TSMC. And that is truly not unrealistic. Trump said in the podcast with Joe Rogan that he considers the subsidies from the Chips Act to be nonsensical and would rather go the route of tariffs. However, since the subsidies from the Chips Act have already been paid, Intel would benefit twice over.\n\n8. For me, one of the biggest bull cases for the foundry business: the big tech companies no longer want to finance NVIDIA's 50% margins. Until recently, FOMO drove the market, with every big company wanting to acquire the best GPUs for fear of missing out. However, AI currently seems to be yielding less return than hoped for, which is why the switch to significantly cheaper and now very competitive ASIC in-house developments such as Google's TPUs seems inevitable. The multi-billion dollar deal to produce Amazon's AI chips on 18A was just the beginning. Other tech companies will follow with their designs.",

Not financial advice.\n\nIntel has been one of the worst performing stocks in the last several years. They just got rid of a CEO, their foundries have not been up to the task, they are severely behind Nvidia and AMD in AI sector with GPUs, they have reported poor earnings, and their consumer CPUs and wafers have been getting railroaded by AMD and TSMC. \n\nHowever, I believe now is the best time to invest. \n\nI believe things are finally starting to turn ship for Intel. For example - \n\n* Their 18As have been getting decent yields despite the biased reporting, and look promising. Sure, TSMC is still their biggest rival and ahead of Intel, but Intel can catch up. If they can pluck a few talents from TSMC, or invest greater in their R&D, with US govt chip money backing them, it's possible.\n* US government has a vested interest is not letting Intel to fail - it's a geopolitical issue to have cutting edge processor technology in US. If US continues to pump money into Intel just like Taiwan has done for TSMC, Intel can afford to expand its foundries and research cutting edge tech.\n* Intel's new Battlemage GPUs seem really cost efficient and there is strong positive sentiment. They will start to gobble up more marketshare and absorb more of Nvidia's AI market as Intel's technology grows in the next gen. This is huge. Nvidia's marketcap is so big that if Intel even eats a bit of the AI market, it will grow exponentially. \n   * Intel's GPU technology looks already promising seeing how they are catching up in drivers and software, and their XeSS technology is ALREADY better than AMD's FSR. \n* They have been getting leaner with mass layoffs and shutting down European plants, and recently reported sell-to-lease transactions. They are cutting costs where they can. \n* Their recent mobile chips - Lunar Lake, have performed fantastic, with high performance and low wattage (which is critical for laptops that suffer under high heat). \n\nAdditionally, if China invades Taiwan, Intel instantly will skyrocket overnight. \n\nI think Intel has serious potential. It may not skyrocket overnight, but I think this is a long-term purchase and hold with little downsides. When you hit rock bottom, the only way you can go is up.",

    "selftext": "Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co is in discussions with Nvidia Corp to produce its Blackwell artificial intelligence chips at the contract manufacturer's new plant in Arizona, three sources familiar with the matter said.\n\nTSMC is already making preparations to start production early next year, the sources said.\n\nNvidia's Blackwell chips, which the company unveiled in March, have so far been manufactured at TSMC's facilities in Taiwan. The company has seen high demand from customers involved in generative AI and accelerated computing for the chips, which it says is 30 times speedier at tasks like serving up answers from chatbots.\n\nThe agreement, if finalised, would secure another customer for TSMC's Arizona facility, which is scheduled to start volume production next year.\n\nTSMC and Nvidia declined to comment. The sources did not want to be identified as the talks were confidential.\n\nTwo of the sources said Apple (AAPL) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) are current customers at the Arizona plant. Apple and AMD did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nHowever, while TSMC plans to produce the front-end process of Nvidia's Blackwell chips in Arizona, the chips will still need to be shipped back to Taiwan for packaging. The Arizona facility does not have chip on wafer on substrate (CoWoS) capacity that is essential to the Blackwell chips, two of the sources said.\n\nAll of TSMC's CoWoS capacity is currently in Taiwan.\n\nTaiwan's TSMC, the world's largest contract chipmaker, is investing tens of billions of dollars in building three facilities in Phoenix and the project has won significant subsidies from the U.S. government which wants to bring semiconductor manufacturing back to the United States.\n\n*source: Yahoo!

    "title": "AMD to lay off 4% of workforce, or about 1,000 employees",
    "selftext": "AMD\u00a0said on Wednesday that it will lay off 4% of its global staff as the longtime computer chipmaker seeks to gain a stronger foothold in the growing artificial intelligence chip space dominated by Nvidia.\n\n*\u2033*As a part of aligning our resources with our largest growth opportunities, we are taking a number of targeted steps that will unfortunately result in reducing our global workforce by approximately 4%,\u201d an AMD representative said in a statement. \u201cWe are committed to treating impacted employees with respect and helping them through this transition.\u201d\n\nAMD had 26,000 employees at the end of last year, according to a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing.\n\nAMD is the second-biggest producer of graphics processing units, or GPUs, behind Nvidia. The company has said AI represents one of its largest growth opportunities. AMD stock is down 5% in 2024 while Nvidia shares are up 200%, making it the most valuable publicly traded company in the world.\n\nAMD produces powerful AI accelerators for data centers,\u00a0including the MI300X,\u00a0which companies such as Meta and Microsoft purchase as an alternative to Nvidia-based systems. But Nvidia dominates the market for powerful AI chips, with over 80% market share, partially because it developed the core software that AI engineers use to develop programs such as OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT.\n\nAMD said in October it expects $5 billion in AI chip sales this year, about a fifth of the $25.7 billion in total sales FactSet projects for AMD\u2019s 2024. AMD believes the total market for AI chips will be $500 billion by 2028, but its total sales are currently dwarfed by Nvidia, which FactSet expects to post $125.9 billion in revenue for calendar year 2024.\n\nGPUs were originally developed for gaming, which is lagging at AMD. AMD\u2019s gaming segment is expected to decline 59% in 2024 to $2.57 billion in revenue, according to FactSet.\n\nAMD also makes processor chips for laptops, desktops and servers, competing primarily with Intel. Its share of server CPU sales rose nearly 3% on an annual basis in the third quarter to 34%, according to Mercury Research.\n\nSource: [https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/13/amd-layoffs-company-to-4percent-of-workforce-or-about-1000-employees-.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/13/amd-layoffs-company-to-4percent-of-workforce-or-about-1000-employees-.html)",

    "selftext": "https://www.reuters.com/technology/us-ordered-tsmc-halt-shipments-china-chips-used-ai-applications-source-says-2024-11-10/\n\nNEW YORK/SINGAPORE, Nov 9 (Reuters) - The U.S. ordered Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (2330.TW), to halt shipments of advanced chips to Chinese customers that are often used in artificial intelligence applications starting Monday, according to a person familiar with the matter.\n\nThe Department of Commerce sent a letter to TSMC imposing export restrictions on certain sophisticated chips, of 7 nanometer or more advanced designs, destined for China that power AI accelerator and graphics processing units (GPU), the person said.\n\nThe U.S. order, which is being reported for the first time, comes just weeks after TSMC notified the Commerce Department that one of its chips had been found in a Huawei AI processor, as Reuters reported last month. Tech research firm Tech Insights had taken apart the product, revealing the TSMC chip and apparent violation of export controls.\n\nHuawei, at the center of the U.S. action, is on a restricted trade list, which requires suppliers to obtain licenses to ship any goods or technology to the company. Any license that could aid Huawei's AI efforts would likely be denied.\n\nTSMC suspended shipments to China-based chip designer Sophgo after its chip matched the one found on the Huawei AI processor, sources told Reuters last month.\n\nReuters could not determine how the chip ended up on Huawei's Ascend 910B, released in 2022, viewed as the most advanced AI chip available from a Chinese company.\n\nThe latest clampdown hits many more companies and will allow the U.S. to assess whether other companies are diverting chips to Huawei for its AI processor.\n\nAs a result of the letter, TSMC notified affected clients that it was suspending shipments of chips starting Monday, the person said.\nThe Commerce Department declined comment.\n\nA spokesperson for TSMC also declined to comment beyond saying it was a \"law-abiding company...committed to complying with all applicable rules and regulations, including applicable export controls.\"\n\nThe Commerce Department communication -- known as an \"is informed\" letter -- allows the U.S. to bypass lengthy rule-writing processes to quickly impose new licensing requirements on specific companies.\n\nIjiwei, a Chinese media site covering the semiconductor industry, reported on Friday that TSMC notified Chinese chip design companies it would suspend 7 nanometer or below chips for AI and GPU customers beginning Nov. 11.\n\nThe action comes as both Republican and Democratic lawmakers have raised concerns about the inadequacy of export controls on China and the Commerce Department's enforcement of them.\n\nIn 2022, the Commerce Department sent is-informed letters to Nvidia and AMD restricting their ability to export top AI-related chips to China, and to chip equipment makers like Lam Research, Applied Materials and KLA to restrict tools to make advanced chips to China.\n\nThe restrictions in those letters were later turned into rules that apply to companies beyond them.\n\nThe U.S. has been delayed in updating rules on tech exports to China. As Reuters reported in July, the Biden administration drafted new rules on some foreign exports of chipmaking equipment and planned to add about 120 Chinese companies to the Commerce Department's restricted entity list, including chipmaking factories, toolmakers, and related companies.\n\nBut despite plans for an August release, and later tentative target dates for publication, the rules still have not been issued.",

It's improving and many have written blogs and KB articles on how Llama3 models are running without issues on MI300 cards. I read some articles of using Mistral as well. However, AMD still isn't able to demonstrate end to end solutions.\n\nWho feels optimistic about AMD and they able to grab at least 5% of AI market in next 2 to 3 years at this snail pace?

    "selftext": "Chinese tech giant Alibaba on Wednesday said that its core Taobao and Tmall e-commerce platforms will now allow payment through Tencent\u2019s WeChat app for the first time.\n\nPreviously, Alibaba\u2019s Chinese e-commerce sites only accepted limited payment options and pushed WeChat Pay rival Alipay as one of the main ways to pay. Alipay is run by Ant Group, an affiliate of Alibaba that was also founded by Jack Ma.\n\n\u201cWe have always been open to collaborations, and have actively explored interoperability and partnerships with our peers,\u201d an Alibaba spokesperson told CNBC. \u201cWe are constantly working to enhance user experience by making shopping more convenient, enjoyable, and efficient.\u201d\n\nTaobao and Tmall will likely begin accepting payments through WeChat Pay this month, a source familiar with the matter who was not authorized to disclose the details publicly, told CNBC.\n\nThe historic move comes as Alibaba looks to reignite growth in its China e-commerce business, which has been under pressure from a sluggish Chinese consumer and from competitors like JD.com amd Temu-owner PDD.\n\nAlibaba CEO Eddie Wu has previously said that the Taobao and Tmall business should return to growth toward the latter half of the firm\u2019s fiscal year 2025.\n\nWeChat has more than 1.3 billion users globally, the majority of whom is located in China. WeChat Pay is one of the biggest mobile payments apps in the country.\n\nBy allowing users to transact through WeChat Pay on Taobao and Tmall, Alibaba could therefore increase its market share in less developed parts of China, the source said.\n\nThe company\u2019s biggest rival JD.com has also allowed WeChat Pay to be used on its platform for a long time.\n\nAnother theme in the background is the regulatory scrutiny that Beijing has put on Chinese technology companies, urging these firms to bring down their so-called walled gardens that block competitors\u2019 products.\n\nAlibaba and Tencent are two of China\u2019s largest internet companies that have built dominance through their sprawling services, which often center around their so-called super apps. That prominance created a situation where, for a long time, rivals would not allow access to each others\u2019 services on their respective platforms.\n\nTech giants started to change these practices over the past few years, amid criticism from regulators. In 2021, Tencent began allowing users to access external links in one-on-one chats. For example, if someone shared a link from Alibaba\u2019s Taobao in WeChat, a user would be able to open that without leaving the messaging app. That same year, some of Alibaba\u2019s other apps began supporting WeChat Pay.\n\nLast week, China\u2019s market regulator said Alibaba had completed a three-year regulatory \u201crectification\u201d process following a 18.23 billion yuan ($2.6 billion) antitrust fine the company received in 2021.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/04/alibaba-to-allow-payment-through-tencents-wechat-pay-on-e-commerce-apps.html",

    "selftext": "Dell reported quarterly results on Thursday that beat Wall Street expectations, powered by an 80% increase in server sales. The stock rose more than 5% in extended trading.\n\nHere\u2019s how the company did for the fiscal second quarter vs. LSEG consensus estimates:\n\nRevenue: $25.06 billion vs. $24.53 billion expected\n\nEPS: $1.89 adjusted, vs. $1.71 expected\n\nNet income climbed 85% to $841 million, or $1.17 per share, from $455 million, or 63 cents per share, in the year-ago period. Revenue increased about 9% from $22.93 billion a year ago.\n\nDell typically provides investors with a forecast on its analyst call. Earlier this year, the company told investors to expect revenue between $93.5 billion and $97.5 billion for the full year, up from $88.4 billion in the prior year.\n\nDell has emerged as a top vendor for servers that can handle artificial intelligence workloads, especially those based around Nvidia chips, as demand skyrockets from cloud providers. Earlier this year, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang called out Dell founder Michael Dell as the person to contact to place orders for systems that include the company\u2019s new chips.\n\nDell shares are up 48% so far this year, but have slumped 34% since the company\u2019s last report.\n\nAI sales are in the company\u2019s Infrastructure Solutions Group, which makes servers and systems for data centers. It\u2019s the company\u2019s fastest-growing unit. Overall ISG sales rose 38% to $11.65 billion, ahead of StreetAccount expectations of $10.44 billion.\n\nThe standout in Dell\u2019s report was Servers and Networking revenue, which includes both AI-oriented servers based around GPUs from Nvidia and AMD, as well as more traditional servers for older applications. It\u2019s part of ISG.\n\nThe unit reported $7.76 billion in sales, rising 80% on an annual basis, and beating StreetAccount expectations of $6.37 billion. Dell said $3.1 billion of that was AI server sales, up from $1.7 billion in the May quarter.\n\nDell operating chief Jeff Clarke attributed the increase in revenue to server demand that continues to rise, and said in a statement that there was an increasing \u201cbacklog\u201d of $3.8 billion in AI server orders that haven\u2019t been fulfilled yet. There\u2019s also a multibillion-dollar \u201cpipeline\u201d of AI server deals from enterprises and cloud providers that haven\u2019t been finalized.\n\nHowever, Dell\u2019s storage business, also part of ISG, fell 5% to $4 billion in sales.\n\nDell\u2019s Client Solutions Group, which focuses on PCs and laptops, declined 4% on an annual basis to $12.41 billion in revenue. Consumer sales fell 22% to $1.86 billion, and the company\u2019s enterprise PC business was flat at $10.55 billion in sales.\n\nDell said that it spent $1 billion in the quarter on share repurchases and dividends.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/29/dell-earnings-report-q2-2025.html",

But in other respects investors\u2019 headlong rush into the American chipmaker\u2019s shares has been every bit as enthralling a spectacle.\n\nGalloping sales of Nvidia\u2019s artificial-intelligence (AI) processors have lifted its market capitalisation from $350bn at the start of 2023 to $1trn, then $2trn, and then, this summer, $3trn.

It proceeded to lose that title\u2014and $900bn in value\u2014amid the recent stockmarket panic, only to claw back most of its losses in the past few weeks. As the firm prepares to report its latest results on August 28th just about everyone expects another blow-out quarter. \u201cHow much money have you made over the years betting against Jensen Huang?\u201d Mr Cramer asked rhetorically on his\u00a0CNBC\u00a0show last week, referring to Nvidia\u2019s boss. These days the Nvidia bear appears to be an endangered species. Or, as Sir David might whisper, \u201cNot an\u00a0*Ursus nvidiaensis*\u00a0in sight.\u201d\n\nFor every hedge fund that trims its stake in the company, another seems to do the opposite. Of the 74 Wall Street analysts who cover Nvidia and are tracked by Bloomberg, 66 advise buying more of its shares; none suggests selling. Their average price target for the stock one year from now implies a market value of around $3.5trn. James Anderson, a veteran tech investor who was an early backer, teases that Nvidia could be worth $49trn in a decade, a shade more than the total value today of the\u00a0S&P\u00a0500 index of large American firms. All it would take is consistent annual sales growth of 60% at current operating margins of 60% or so, plus some plausible assumptions about cashflow. (Mr Anderson\u2019s current employer, Lingotto, is owned by Exor, the biggest shareholder of\u00a0*The Economist*\u2019s parent company.)\n\nInvestment bankers at Jefferies, Goldman Sachs and\u00a0UBS\u00a0project that Nvidia\u2019s yearly revenues will double this year, to over $100bn, grow by as much as half in 2025 and by double digits until at least 2027. By then its operating profit could exceed $150bn\u2014a third more than Apple, tech\u2019s most successful money-spinner, managed last year. The numbers are getting so big, so fast, that this alone should give the bulls pause. As they catch their breath, they might wish to ruminate on two contradictions lurking in Nvidia\u2019s long-term growth story.\n\nThe first concerns its main supplier. Nvidia\u00a0[designs chips](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2024/02/27/why-do-nvidias-chips-dominate-the-ai-market)\u00a0but does not produce them. That falls to\u00a0[TSMC](https://www.economist.com/business/2024/04/11/tsmcs-american-chipmaking-plans-grow-25bn-more-ambitious), a Taiwanese contract chipmaker that dominates the market for the cutting-edge silicon that goes into\u00a0AI\u00a0servers. As demand for these has rocketed, Nvidia has gone from one among many of\u00a0TSMC\u2019s clients to probably its second-biggest behind Apple. If it is indeed \u201ccustomer\u00a0B\u201d, one of two that represent at least 10% of\u00a0TSMC\u2019s revenues and must thus be disclosed in regulatory filings, it spent $7.7bn with\u00a0TSMC\u00a0last year, up from $5.5bn two years earlier. Given that most of Nvidia\u2019s purchase commitments of $19bn for 2025 are likely to end up with\u00a0TSMC, it could soon eclipse the current \u201ccustomer\u00a0A\u201d, which handed the Taiwanese firm just shy of $18bn in 2023.\n\nEven as Nvidia\u2019s and\u00a0TSMC\u2019s fates become more entwined, however, their product cycles are diverging. Earlier this year Mr Huang vowed to launch a new and improved\u00a0AI\u00a0chip every year, rather than every couple of years.\u00a0TSMC\u00a0is therefore in a mad rush to expand capacity, pledging to invest up to $32bn this year and possibly more in 2025. But it still needs at least 18 months to erect a new factory. And because these can cost $20bn a pop, careful discussions with clients typically start a year or two in advance. It is unclear how Nvidia\u2019s accelerated timeline fits in with\u00a0TSMC\u2019s more measured pace of decision-making. In an early sign of trouble, Nvidia has delayed shipments of its latest chips, called Blackwell, by a couple of months owing to technical kinks.\n\nNvidia\u2019s reliance on\u00a0TSMC\u00a0also highlights the second tension in the bulls\u2019 case. Because the manufacturer controls the volume and efficiency of production, the only way for Nvidia to ensure that it meets investors\u2019 bullish expectations for sales is to raise prices. A Blackwell chip will cost 20-25% more than the earlier generation, which was twice the price of the one before. Each chip is more powerful than the last, so the cost per unit of computing power is probably declining. But not fast enough for customers.\n\nIn August Andy Jassy, chief executive of Amazon, whose cloud-computing arm is a big user of Nvidia chips, acknowledged that he had \u201cheard loud and clear from customers that they relish better price performance\u201d. His company is investing in its own designs. So are Google, Meta, Microsoft and Tesla.\u00a0[AMD](https://www.economist.com/business/2024/01/31/could-amd-break-nvidias-chokehold-on-chips), a rival chip-designer, has gone from almost no\u00a0AI-chip sales in 2022 to a forecast $5bn this year. On August 19th it said it would buy\u00a0ZT\u00a0Systems, a server maker, helping it to compete with Nvidia\u2019s end-to-end offering. Chinese tech champions such as Huawei, barred by American sanctions from procuring top-end Nvidia gear, may forge breakthroughs that could do to Nvidia\u2019s market share what Chinese competitors like\u00a0BYD\u00a0did to Tesla\u2019s in electric cars.\n\n# Exit pursued by a bear\n\nAssuming a killer app eventually emerges\u2014which it hasn\u2019t yet\u2014generative\u00a0ai\u00a0is unlikely to become widely used unless it gets much cheaper; a ChatGPT\u00a0query can cost seven times more to answer than Google search. Nvidia may soon have to choose between lowering prices to support its growth or maintaining prices to protect its profit margin. For now Nvidia bulls think they can have it both ways. The whiff of irrational exuberance may become too overwhelming for\u00a0*U. nvidiaensis*\u00a0to resist.\u00a0\u25a0",

    "selftext": "Nvidia Thesis ($200 PT by Dec-2025, 53% Gross, 38% IRR)\n\nP.S.: Not financial advice, just my quick read-through of fundamentals\n\nNvidia is the world\u2019s largest chip company, spearheading the global AI revolution. It holds a dominant\u00a098% market share\u00a0in Data Center GPUs.\nLast fiscal year, Nvidia generated $60 billion in revenue, with ~80% coming from its Data Center segment. This year, revenue is expected to double to $120B, with ~$105B coming from Data Centers.\nI believe there\u2019s a\u00a0~50% upside\u00a0in the stock by the end of 2025, translating to a 38% IRR. The current street estimates for Nvidia\u2019s Data Center revenue in 2025 and 2026 stand at $150B and $170B, respectively. However, I find these projections conservative. My analysis points to\u00a0$200B in 2026 Data Center revenue, translating to ~$5 EPS in CY2026. Applying a 40x NTM PE (Nvidia\u2019s typical trading multiple) yields a $200 price target by the end of 2025.\nKey Reasons for My Bullish Thesis:\n1. We are in the early stages of the AI Arms Race.\n    * Hyperscalers have spent $200B on capex over the last two years, with plans to spend $700B over the next 2.5 years\u2014much of it allocated to AI and GPUs.\n    * Microsoft currently operates 192 data centers and plans to scale to 900 by 2028. If Microsoft is this aggressive, other hyperscalers are likely to pursue similar aggressive expansion plans.\n    * Large Language Model (LLM) capacity is doubling every six months. For instance, Claude 3\u2019s context window (now 200K tokens) is projected to increase to 1 million tokens by next year. Such improvements necessitate hyper-demand growth for powerful GPUs that can serve both training and inferencing. There isn't any chip, apart from NVIDIA's Blackwell, that can meet this demand.\n2. Supply Chain Insights:\u00a0Have been looking into supply chain data, and all data points reflect\n    * TSMC\u2019s CoWoS production, crucial for Nvidia\u2019s Blackwell architecture, is set to grow from 15,000 units/month in 2023 to 40,000 by late 2024\u2014a ~3x increase.\n    * Applied Materials has revised its HBM packaging revenue forecast from 4x to 6x growth this year.\n    * SK Hynix and Samsung are reallocating 20% of their DRAM production to HBM3e.\n    * AMD\u2019s CEO estimates the AI chip market will be worth $400 billion by 2027; Intel's CEO puts the number at $1 trillion by 2030\n3. Blackwell Product Roadmap:\n    * Nvidia is transitioning from a 2-year to a 1-year product cycle. The B100 and GB200 chips will ship later this year, with the B200 expected in early 2025. This is one of the most aggressive product roadmaps in industry's history. In my estimate, NVIDIA could sell 60,000 units of GB200 systems with $2M per unit price, driving $120B in annual revenue in 2025 from GB200 alone.",

    "selftext": "So over years, I've been gathering over 50 stocks. Of course, some have performed great, largely because my timing, mid-2022, was an excellent entry point. But of course, I can't help brag about my selection choice. For example, Qualcomm, AMD, JPM, MSFT, GOOG, Citi.\n\nI (think), I hit most of the semiconductor names, except NVDA. For some reason, it never felt like a good investment. I have my skepticism about LLMs and Gen-AI hype. Besides, generating cat pics or idle plays with Chat-GPT, I haven't\u00a0***yet***\u00a0seen a business effectively using Gen-AI as a compelling competitive edge. So, please educate me here as well. AMD is different because of data center servers product line - which is more solid story.\n\nBesides missing such obvious biggies, not all of what I touched has performed. I felt, European carmakers (BMW, VW, MBG) were deep value at PE 3-5 and 8-9% yields, but obviously I was wrong. They were cheap for a reason.\n\n**Main question**\u00a0- I was wondering if I can do a simulation of hypothetical scenario where I had simply invested in index, saving me enormous time in research. If so, please suggest tools/sites?\n\nNote that the amounts and time of entry/exit are not constant, so I can't use the simple lumpsum or periodic investing calculators that assume regular constant amounts and intervals.\n\nWith 50 stocks in my portfolio, I wonder if it is just mirroring the index, or generating any real alpha. Obviously, when I buy something, I am highly convinced of my reasonings. So, it's hard to part with what I feel are \"my gems\". How do you cope with these emotional aspects of investing?",

The company had $5.34 billion in cash and short-term investments as of the second quarter.\n\nThe computing requirements for AI have dictated that tech companies string together thousands of chips in clusters to achieve the necessary amount of data crunching horsepower. Stringing together the vast numbers of chips has meant the makeup of whole server systems has become increasingly important, which is why AMD is acquiring ZT Systems.\n\n\u201cAI systems are our number one strategic priority,\u201d AMD CEO Lisa Su said in an interview with Reuters.\n\nThe addition of ZT Systems engineers will allow AMD to more quickly test and roll out its latest AI graphics processing units (GPUs) at the scale cloud computing giants such as Microsoft require, Su said.\n\n\u201cThe main way (ZT Systems) is additive to the company is we sell more GPUs,\u201d Su said.\n\nAMD plans to break off its server manufacturing business and sell it once the deal closes, as it has no plans to compete with companies such as Super Micro Computer, Su said.\n\nAMD has not yet held talks with potential buyers.\n\nZT Systems Chief Executive Frank Zhang will join AMD and report to AMD\u2019s data center chief, Forrest Norrod.\n\nThe closely held ZT Systems has roughly 2,500 employees of which AMD plans to retain about 1,000 engineers. Currently, ZT Systems generates annual revenue of roughly $10 billion, Su said.\n\nExecutives expect the deal to close in the first half of 2025 and expect an additional 12 to 18 months to sell the manufacturing business.\n\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang said at the company\u2019s developer conference in March that the one-time chip designer now creates and sells entire data centers, or the individual components needed to build one. This year analysts expect the company to generate $105.9 billion from its data center segment, which includes chips and other AI hardware. Su said last month the company expects to collect roughly $4.5 billion worth of AI chip revenue this year.

What I'm curious about is:\n\n* What is your opinion of Eric Schmidt? Is he generally a trustworthy industry insider? Do you trust his opinions on this matter? (I looked for his name on this sub and it's rarely mentioned).\n\n* If you don't trust him, what might be his motives for these comments? For example, is it perhaps to indirectly pump up his own Alphabet stock, which is probably #2 behind Nvidia and will benefit from big AI wave.

He told the Wall Street Journal that he requested the video to be taken down because he had misspoken about Google\u2019s lax work culture in the session.\n\n* Schmidt suggested Nvidia won\u2019t be the only winner in AI, but there aren\u2019t a lot of other obvious choices. He said that he currently believes big companies who can invest more money into Nvidia chips and data centers will gain a technological lead over smaller competitors that can\u2019t spend as freely.\n\n* \u201cAt the moment, the gap between the frontier models \u2014 there are only three \u2014 and everyone else appears to be getting larger,\u201d Schmidt said. \u201cSix months ago, I was convinced that the gap was getting smaller, so I invested lots of money in the little companies. Now I\u2019m not so sure.\u201d\n\n* Schmidt said it will be difficult for competitors to catch up with Nvidia because many of the most important open source tools that AI developers use are based on the company\u2019s CUDA programming language. He said AMD\u2019s software that translates Nvidia\u2019s CUDA code for its own chips \u201cdoesn\u2019t work yet.\u201d\n\n* Schmidt, who started venture firm Innovation Endeavors in 2010, still holds about 147 million shares of Alphabet, according to Bloomberg, valued at about $24 billion. In addition to startup investing, he has been a philanthropist and advised several government committees on technology.",

The results were followed by the largest single day drop in Intel\u2019s stock price in 50 years, down 26%.\n\nThe chip firm, which both designs its own chips as well as manufactures them, has been struggling to keep up with other semiconductor competitors amid intensifying competition due to the AI boom. \n\nAccording to Gelsinger, the company\u2019s latest losses were compounded by its decision to more rapidly produce its Core Ultra PC chips which are build to handle AI workloads. \n\nCompetitors such as AMD and Qualcomm have also been racing to roll out more AI-focused chips, chasing the success of Nvidia. \n\nUnder Gelsinger, the company is also looking to grow its struggling chip foundry business, and wrestle back market share lost to Taiwan\u2019s dominant TSMC and South Korea\u2019s Samsung in recent years.\n\nIntel and Arm declined to comment on the sale when contacted by CNBC on Wednesday.\n\nIntel, which has lost nearly 60% of its stock value so far this year, was slightly up in after-hours trading, according to LSEG data.\n\nArm\u2019s shares have been performing well since its IPO last September, up nearly 65% year to date. \n\nJapan\u2019s SoftBank Group has a majority stake in Arm, and has been a beneficiary of the jump in the company\u2019s shares.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/14/intel-sells-stake-in-uk-chip-designer-arm-amid-company-wide-restructuring-and-cost-cuts-.html",

    "title": "The Consumer Recession of 2023-2024 and the Future",
    "selftext": "Alright so this going to be a long post so bear with me. I think we are currently in a consumer recession right now. Now you\u2019re probably thinking ok but how? GDP continues to grow, unemployment continues to be stable, and the market is higher than ever right now. I am going to talk about some companies here that will hopefully give support to my theory.  \n\n1. Microsoft (MSFT)\n\nNow you\u2019re probably wondering why this is the first company I am bringing up when Microsoft grew revenue and income. Microsoft grew revenue by 10% and net income by 20%. Microsoft does both software and hardware. The software parts of the business like Office, Cloud, and Services increased substantially. However when you look at the hardware side of the business it paints a different picture. \n\nDevice revenue decreased 20%. These are things like personal computers, accessories, and other electronics that Microsoft sells and this part of their business declined considerably. Gaming revenue decreased by 5% with Xbox hardware sales falling 11%. We are currently seeing a similar trend in 2024. People are pulling back on items like PCs and gaming consoles. \n\nNow you\u2019re probably thinking \u201cyeah random redditor not everybody buys PCs/Xboxs every year. This means nothing.\u201d \n\nSo now we go to our next company. \n\n2. Apple\n\nLike Microsoft Apple is a big tech company that is integrated into our society and the every day consumer. If you don\u2019t personally use them you know someone who uses their products. If we look at Apples results in 2023 and we look at product sales they declined from 316.1 billion to 298 billion. Hardware sales were down across the board. Macs, iPhones, iPads, and Wearables all declined. However no what didn\u2019t decline? Services. Like Microsoft services grew for Apple from 78.1 billion to 85.2 billion. Once again we are seeing this pattern of physical products that appeal to the middle class consumer fall. \n\nNow you\u2019re probably thinking \u201cyeah random redditor but Apple isn\u2019t cool anymore so of course their products are not selling. So that makes no sense and means nothing in the grand scheme of things.\u201d Ok let\u2019s keep going. \n\n3. Nike\n\nNike is a global fashion and one of the biggest in the world if not the biggest. Like Apple if you don\u2019t use their products you personally know someone who uses them. They\u2019re everywhere. Nike reported a decline in revenue by 2% in 2024 and is currently forecasting a 10% drop in Q1 2025 and a drop for the full year of 2025. We saw Nike report product declines like their shoes in 2024 and it\u2019s expected to get worse in 2025. The stock is currently sitting at a multi year low and besides Covid these levels haven\u2019t been seen since 2018.\n\nNow you\u2019re probably thinking \u201cok random redditor but Nike isn\u2019t cool anymore and Adidas is better and sells more track suits to the Eastern Europeans. So it makes sense why it\u2019s down.\u201d Ok lets look at more. \n\n4. Home Depot and Lowe\u2019s\n\nThe two home building retailer giants of the US. If you own a home or have done work on your home you\u2019re familiar with these 2 companies. These 2 companies are staples to the entire US economy. Similar to UPS and FedEx if you want to get a general look at how the economy is doing you\u2019re paying attention to these two companies as they\u2019re crucial to its health. In 2023 we saw Home Depots sales decrease by 3% and earnings decrease by 9.5%. We just saw Home Depot recently report their earnings and according to them they expect more pain as the consumer continues to pullback. We saw a similar result for Lowe\u2019s. They reported a net sales decrease of 11% and are forecasting another sales decrease in 2024. With expectations being another 2-3% fall in comparable sales. \n\nBoth Home Depot and Lowe\u2019s stock are still down from their highs in 2021. Home Depot is down 16% and Lowe\u2019s down 10% which was close to 3 years ago. \n\nNow you\u2019re probably thinking \u201cok random redditor but those are boomer companies nobody cares about.\u201d Ok how about another one. \n\n5. Target \n\nTarget is a company that you know well cause you either have a mom or a girlfriend or both who spends their day there. Target is the upperclass Walmart that is a bit more luxurious and like all the other companies I mention they appeal to the middle/high class. \n\nIn 2023 Target reported a sales decline of 1.7% and a comparable sales decline of 3.7%. Full year revenue decreased by 1.7%. The company going forward is expecting a continued consumer pullback and is expecting either flat or declines. Target stock is currently down 48% from its high with its high being in 2021. \n\nI can really keep going with this. Here is some more. \n\n1. Estee Lauder: massive stock decline\n\n2. Ulta Beauty: massive stock decline\n\n3. UPS (a crucial economic stock): massive stock decline\n\n4. Lululemon: massive stock decline\n\n5. Dollar General: massive stock decline\n\n6. Hershey: massive stock decline \n\n7. Starbucks: massive stock decline\n\nNow what is the point of all of this and all these companies mentioned and talked about? These are all companies that sell a semi luxury product that appeals to the middle class consumer. Now we are seeing the middle class  consumer pull back on these products. Maybe you\u2019re not buying the next Microsoft PC this year, or the new iPhone, or the new pair of Nike sneakers due to rising costs in other areas. This is causing the market to price in future bad results and causing the stock price to crash. \n\nWe are seeing a case where the market is not reflecting the economy. Businesses all across various industries are showing declines across the board and it\u2019s only expected to get worse. Now with all these declines in other industries why is the market so high? The answer is tech. Companies like Nvidia, Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Apple, Meta, Broadcom, Qualcomm, AMD, etc. are dominating the market. With these stocks continuing to increase and other stocks continuing to decrease it\u2019s only getting worse. They have a heavy weight on the indexes and they\u2019re causing most of the gains in the index while we are seeing other sectors decline. \n\nThis has caused tech valuations to soar and other areas of the market to lag. Now what does this mean going forward. Are we due for a massive decline in the market where we see tech finally come down? \n\nI personally don\u2019t think so. However I think going forward we won\u2019t see the returns that tech has given now going forward. I think these stock declines in the market has presented opportunities and we can possibly see a sector rotation. For example the Fed cutting rates and alleviating pressure on the consumer. A case where tech lags behind and we see other areas of the market which have fallen start to climb. I could be wrong on this but these are just my thoughts. Let me know what you think about this theory.",

    "selftext": "YTD INTC is down about 58.5% as of last check and in the short run it's outlook looks terrible especially given the negative press with their core product desktop CPUs.\n\nHowever I can't help but draw parallels to how AMD was looking about 10 years ago trading for under $2 and now for roughly $130. \n\nIn some ways I feel Intel has a much better potential to bounce back than even AMD did. \n\nChief of which being how incredibly wide their business is. \nWhile AMD is chiefly focused on CPUs and GPUs, Intel has both plus a much stronger presence in wireless chips, storage hardware, the USB patent and may others that AMD does / did not have. In fact if you open up an Intel based desktop or laptop there's a good chance the majority of the comments could be Intel based. \n\nPlus they do have manufacturing capabilities that AMD does not have and major sponsorship from the US government to bring that production to the US as a strategicly important product manufacturing firm. \n\nThis seems to be prime opportunity for Intel to consolidate to their core business and spin off smaller divisions to generate cash to grow their core business back to profitability. And\nAMD and Intel functioning as essentially a duopoly in the x86 space neither can really go away. \n\nHowever, things are different now than with the recovery of AMD. Chief of which being the rise of ARM and alternatives to the x86 architecture like with Apple silicone. \n\nI keep going back on if INTC is the best value buy opportunity in a while or it really is the hot garbage the recent controversy about their 13th and 14th Gen CPUs failing in mass make it seem to be. \n\nNote, I'm just a casual stocks speculator and PC gaming enthusiast and really should dig into their balance sheets more. \n\n\nEdit: just to be clear, I haven't bought into INTC yet, just testing the waters and getting a gut check before I make any moves. \n\nI feel confident they will recover eventually but, as I mentioned in a comment here, I'm concerned about to what extent and how soon. Is the opportunity cost of buying and holding now or even buying long term call options worth it compared to just holding the cash in a money market or investing in SPY? That opportunity cost I'm not as confident on.",

    "selftext": "# INTC is a bet. Putting money on INTC pre-dotcom and pre-AI revolution that is.\n\n*What do I mean by this?*\n\nLet me preface this by saying my portfolio is a reverse SMH with Intel on the top. Consistently bought the 30s-33s over the past year. I am currently a bagholder with 10k cost basis (35% of holdings) down 40% as of writing.\n\nIntel is basically a lame duck company. That is how it has been for the past 20 years, and right now. And the bet is that they will no longer be one. There is no other way to logically invest in Intel other than seeing it as a bet.\n\nThis is not, or may not even, going to be a growth stock for a while. This is (no longer) a dividend stock. This isn't even a real cyclical, because for that you'd need strong demand cycles, and that demand is met by other companies. Their product lines are not strong enough or they'd be a true competitor in their spaces and we would not be having these discussions. They have been a wealth desert.\n\n*What exactly is Intel's bet?*\n\n**The Intel bet is twofold: 1) The threat of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan, and 2a) The AI revolution manifesting 2b) Intel catching up in time to grab a significant market share**\n\n**Intel is a bet on America, or a bet on a Miracle. Or both.**\n\nIntel is about as risky as any option going on right now. There is a very real possibility, in stock terms, that you've wasted your money (either literally or through opportunity cost), for the slim chance that you hit it big. **The value of Intel is now the chances that the market sees it achieves either of these bets.**\n\nWith this in mind we need to understand the psychology of the Intel investor, as I am one.\n\n*What is an INTC bagholder but a miserable pile of secrets?*\n\nWhy do people buy Intel? Well before they wanted to collect dividend like it's MCD or GE or some other boomer stock. The company restructured itself to provide maximum immediate and dividend value to shareholders by gutting innovation and resting on laurels. That was the perception of Intel for the past 20 years.\n\nNow, people buy Intel to participate on the aforementioned bets. The company has signaled it wishes to make this turnaround and so has the US government. If you are in it for any other reason (or you are unfortunate to still be working there, not gutted and it's your 401k which is a minority), you should not touch this stock at all. You need to accept that the money is forfeit. You are not a tech investor. You are making a bet and that makes you a gambler.\n\nTSMC and Samsung are the top dogs because they are safe, and you are betting they won't be. NVIDIA, AMD, Qualcomm and such have taken the lead, and you are betting that there's a spot for Intel. If China relents then that bet is dead, and if AI is dead, then Intel's recovery is moot. Even if AI is not dead, it needs to actually pull off the recovery, and that's where the other bet lies.\n\n*Should I become a bagholder?*\n\nOnce you have accepted that this stock carries massive risk and that your money is forfeit, then you can bother owning it.\n\n**Going long in Intel right now is the closest stock you can get to being an option. Like buying puts/calls, there is no dividend here. Very very risky, high chance of failure.**",

    "selftext": "Intel shares plunged the most in 50 years on Friday, reaching a price not seen since 2013, after the chipmaker reported a big earnings miss and announced a massive restructuring.\n\nThe stock plummeted 27% to $21.22 as of late morning trading. It would be the second worst day ever for the shares, behind only a 31% drop in July 1974, which was three years after Intel\u2019s IPO. The company\u2019s market cap is now below $100 billion.\n\nThe dramatic selloff contributed to a 2.4% drop in the Nasdaq and pulled down global semiconductor stocks. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. \u2014 known as TSMC \u2014 closed 4.6% lower in Taiwan, and Samsung was down more than 4% at the end of the session in South Korea. TSMC is the world\u2019s biggest manufacturer of chips, while Samsung is the largest memory semiconductor firm globally.\n\nIntel\u2019s numbers were bad across the board.\n\nThe company swung to a $1.61 billion net loss after reporting net income of $1.48 billion in the year-earlier period. Adjusted earnings per share of 2 cents fell way short of the average analyst estimate of 10 cents, according to LSEG. Revenue also missed expectations.\n\nIntel said it won\u2019t pay its dividend in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2024 and lowered its forecast for full-year capital expenditures by over 20%. The company said it would lay off more than 15% of its employees as part of a $10 billion cost-reduction plan.\n\n\u201cThis is the most substantial restructuring of Intel since the memory microprocessor transition four decades ago,\u201d Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger told CNBC\u2019s Jon Fortt in an interview that aired on Friday. \u201cWe have laid out an audacious journey of rebuilding this company, and we\u2019re going to get that done.\u201d\n\nA decision to more rapidly produce Core Ultra PC chips that can handle artificial intelligence workloads contributed to the loss, Gelsinger said on a conference call with analysts. The company said pricing was more competitive than planned during the quarter, as AMD, Qualcomm and other companies have been working to take market share from Intel, which has fallen way behind its rivals in the AI battle.\n\nThe job cuts will mainly take place this year, Gelsinger wrote in a memo. It\u2019s the largest of any single job cut listed on Layoffs.fyi, an industry tracker that\u2019s been operating since March 2020.\n\nCompeting on merit\n\nAdding pressure to the chip sector is a report from The Information that AI chipmaker Nvidia is the subject of a U.S. Department of Justice antitrust investigation.\n\nThe DOJ is looking at complaints that the company allegedly abused its market dominance in AI, The Information reported.\n\nIn response, a spokesperson for Nvidia said that the company \u201cwins on merit.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe compete based on decades of investment and innovation, scrupulously adhering to all laws, making NVIDIA openly available in every cloud and on-prem for every enterprise, and ensuring that customers can choose whatever solution is best for them,\u201d the spokesperson said.\n\nThe spokesperson added that Nvidia is \u201chappy to provide any information regulators need.\u201d\n\nCNBC has also reached out to the DOJ on the report.\n\nSamsung rival SK Hynix, which supplies U.S. giant Nvidia, also fell sharply to close more than 10% lower. The sell-off continued in Europe. Shares of ASML, which sells key tools required to make cutting-edge chips, declined along with STMicroelectronics and Infineon.\n\nThe VanEck Semiconductor ETF, which includes major names in the sector, fell more than 4% on Friday after plummeting 6.5% a day earlier.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/02/intel-share-plunge-drags-down-global-chip-stocks-from-tsmc-to-samsung.html",

    "title": "Analyzing the Analysts: Using average analyst price target to identify buying opportunities amongst the top 100 companies in the S&P",
    "selftext": "Hello everyone,\n\nI'm a lazy investor and don't like to do much due diligence, but I do like to make money. Unfortunately these two things about me are often at odds as I've lost money in the past for not doing my DD. As such, I continue to be lazy but I try and find ways to work around doing due diligence and hopefully finding loop holes.\n\nOne such way that I have been thinking about recently is using analyst ratings, reviews and price targets as a surrogate for due diligence. In essence, I try to just have these analysts do the work for me. The idea is that much in the same way that with those who believe in technical analysis hold that everything you need to know about a stock is baked into it's price action, and so when something good happens the stock price goes up and when something bad happens the stock price goes down, thus all you need is to analyze trends in stock price and you'll be analyzing everything about the stock by proxy, I have a thesis (or theory) that perhaps you can do the same or something similar with analyst price targets of companies.\n\nNow I know that anyone who has read this far already thinks I'm an idiot. Many experienced individual investors probably find market analysts to be stupid and therefore I'm stupid for following their lead, but I would argue to the contrary for a few reasons. As much as I have put in a lot of effort to learn about how the market operates (been investing for the last 6 years, started learning actively about it as much as I could a couple years prior to that), there is still much I don't know as I don't have a finance or economics degree. Moreover, as bad as you may think an analyst is, they are at least competent enough to keep their job as an analyst at the investment firm that allows them to make stock price target selections. Lastly, and most importantly, what I am about to discuss below uses the aggregate of numerous analyst price targets so I'm not relying on a single analyst, but several (probably between 10 and 40 per company). I think if two-dozen analysts are strongly in favor of a company, it is unlikely that my novice investor wisdom would have researched the company and found a flaw that they all missed.\n\nSo what I did yesterday evening was go through the top 100 S&P 500 companies by market cap and find the current average price target for them on Yahoo Finance. I then divided the current stock price (at the close on 7/31) by that price target and expressed it as a percentage to see how far off the company was from the average price target analysts were aiming for. Then I also listed how many total ratings each company had, and how many of them were 'Strong Buys' and 'Buys'.\n\nThis yielded the following table:\n\n|+|A|B|C|D|E|F|G|H|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|1|Company|Current Price|Price Target|Percent to Target|Total Ratings|# Strong Buy Ratings|# Buy Ratings|% of Ratings that were Strong Buys|\n|2|AAPL|222.08|209.76|105.87%|38|11|21|28.95%|\n|3|MSFT|418.35|459.66|91.01%|34|14|13|41.18%|\n|4|NVDA|117.02|125.69|93.10%|38|14|15|36.84%|\n|5|AMZN|186.98|206.43|90.58%|47|15|28|31.91%|\n|6|META|474.83|490.04|96.90%|63|21|34|33.33%|\n|7|GOOG|173.15|185.45|93.37%|5|0|3|0.00%|\n|8|BRK.B|438.5|441.47|99.33%|6|1|3|16.67%|\n|9|LLY|804.27|817.03|98.44%|22|9|8|40.91%|\n|10|AVGO|160.68|180.62|88.96%|29|10|17|34.48%|\n|11|JPM|212.8|200.66|106.05%|28|9|13|32.14%|\n|12|TSLA|232.07|189.09|122.73%|23|0|0|0.00%|\n|13|UNH|576.16|569.6|101.15%|22|11|11|50.00%|\n|14|XOM|118.59|122.83|96.55%|25|5|11|20.00%|\n|15|V|265.67|282.26|94.12%|39|13|22|33.33%|\n|16|JNJ|157.85|158.53|99.57%|23|4|8|17.39%|\n|17|PG|160.76|161.5|99.54%|22|6|4|27.27%|\n|18|MA|463.71|474.87|97.65%|39|14|20|35.90%|\n|19|HD|368.16|355.97|103.42%|33|12|12|36.36%|\n|20|COST|822|886.84|92.69%|29|7|11|24.14%|\n|21|WMT|68.64|68.29|100.51%|32|8|7|25.00%|\n|22|MRK|113.13|132.14|85.61%|21|4|7|19.05%|\n|23|BAC|40.31|41.95|96.09%|30|6|16|20.00%|\n|24|CVX|160.47|167.84|95.61%|24|6|10|25.00%|\n|25|NFLX|628.35|640.43|98.11%|41|11|14|26.83%|\n|26|KO|66.74|64.8|102.99%|25|5|7|20.00%|\n|27|CRM|258.8|274.18|94.39%|45|16|25|35.56%|\n|28|ADBE|551.65|566.58|97.36%|31|11|14|35.48%|\n|29|PEP|172.67|168.65|102.38%|22|10|10|45.45%|\n|30|TMO|613.34|629.42|97.45%|15|8|6|53.33%|\n|31|AMD|144.48|175.48|82.33%|31| | |0.00%|\n|32|LIN|453.5|475.32|95.41%| | | |#DIV/0!|\n|33|ORCL|139.45|140.03|99.59%|36|10|16|27.78%|\n|34|WFC|59.34|59.8|99.23%|31|4|8|12.90%|\n|35|ACN|330.62|348.01|95.00%|29|7|9|24.14%|\n|36|CSCO|48.45|50.56|95.83%|27|8|11|29.63%|\n|37|MCD|265.4|276.47|96.00%|33|8|15|24.24%|\n|38|QCOM|180.95|191.24|94.62%|23|2|7|8.70%|\n|39|GE|170.2|171.93|98.99%|17|5| |29.41%|\n|40|ABT|105.94|124.37|85.18%|20|7|6|35.00%|\n|41|TXN|203.81|187.18|108.88%|32|6|8|18.75%|\n|42|DHR|277.08|284.09|97.53%|17|7|6|41.18%|\n|43|AMGN|332.47|320.24|103.82%|25|3|7|12.00%|\n|44|INTU|647.35|711.36|91.00%|22|6|3|27.27%|\n|45|PM|115.16|115.74|99.50%|18|2|7|11.11%|\n|46|PFE|30.54|29.38|103.95%|22|2|11|9.09%|\n|47|IBM|192.14|172.59|111.33%|25|4|4|16.00%|\n|48|DIS|93.69|123.11|76.10%|30|5|10|16.67%|\n|49|VZ|40.52|45.6|88.86%|32|2|6|6.25%|\n|50|CAT|346.2|337.62|102.54%|24|4|7|16.67%|\n|51|NOW|814.39|807.1|100.90%|34|13|17|38.24%|\n|52|AMAT|212.2|248.8|85.29%|21|4|15|19.05%|\n|53|GS|509.03|476.64|106.80%|27|4|7|14.81%|\n|54|CMCSA|41.27|46.36|89.02%|31|12|18|38.71%|\n|55|SPGI|484.73|521.39|92.97%|15|1|9|6.67%|\n|56|RTX|117.49|103.93|113.05%| | | |#DIV/0!|\n|57|ISRG|444.61|471.87|94.22%|17|6|5|35.29%|\n|58|NEE|76.39|80.23|95.21%|15|5|8|33.33%|\n|59|UNP|246.73|242.11|101.91%|29|5|7|17.24%|\n|60|AXP|253.04|253.26|99.91%|28|6|4|21.43%|\n|61|LOW|245.51|250.99|97.82%|32|8|10|25.00%|\n|62|T|19.25|19.3|99.74%|30|6|3|20.00%|\n|63|HON|204.75|226.96|90.21%|20|7|9|35.00%|\n|64|UBER|64.47|79.96|80.63%| | | |#DIV/0!|\n|65|VRTX|495.72|483.91|102.44%|27|10|12|37.04%|\n|66|MS|103.21|105.64|97.70%|27|3|14|11.11%|\n|67|TJX|113.02|107.04|105.59%|27|9|14|33.33%|\n|68|INTC|30.74|38.02|80.85%|41| |18|0.00%|\n|69|BKNG|3715.01|4192.39|88.61%| | | |#DIV/0!|\n|70|PGR|214.12|237.47|90.17%|19|5|4|26.32%|\n|71|C|64.88|71.01|91.37%|29|5|12|17.24%|\n|72|ELV|532.03|599.13|88.80%| | | |#DIV/0!|\n|73|BLK|876.5|936.85|93.56%|15|3|9|20.00%|\n|74|PLD|126.05|135.68|92.90%|18|4|8|22.22%|\n|75|LMT|541.92|535.31|101.23%|22|7| |31.82%|\n|76|ETN|304.79|345.86|88.13%|24|3|4|12.50%|\n|77|REGN|1079.19|1104.34|97.72%|26|7|6|26.92%|\n|78|MU|109.82|174.41|62.97%|31|8|20|25.81%|\n|79|CB|275.66|277.84|99.22%|19|5|11|26.32%|\n|80|SYK|327.45|378.81|86.44%|27|11|6|40.74%|\n|81|ADI|231.38|255.84|90.44%|26|6|10|23.08%|\n|82|LRCX|921.24|1041.75|88.43%|19|3|12|15.79%|\n|83|MMC|222.57|223.48|99.59%|19|4|7|21.05%|\n|84|BSX|73.88|87.57|84.37%|24|10|8|41.67%|\n|85|MDT|80.32|92.43|86.90%|23|4|7|17.39%|\n|86|BA|190.6|219.35|86.89%|25|7|7|28.00%|\n|87|ADP|262.62|264.65|99.23%|18|1|1|5.56%|\n|88|AMT|220.4|230.39|95.66%|22|7|14|31.82%|\n|89|PANW|324.73|343.43|94.55%|41|13|16|31.71%|\n|90|KLAC|823.07|868.07|94.82%|14|2|4|14.29%|\n|91|BX|142.15|135.47|104.93%|14|6|6|42.86%|\n|92|CI|348.67|393.25|88.66%|17|6|7|35.29%|\n|93|BMY|47.56|50.47|94.23%|22|5|4|22.73%|\n|94|GILD|76.06|81.02|93.88%|28|2|11|7.14%|\n|95|SCHW|65.19|73.89|88.23%|19|5|9|26.32%|\n|96|DE|371.98|422.99|87.94%|22|4|3|18.18%|\n|97|FI|163.57|177.14|92.34%|19|1|2|5.26%|\n|98|UPS|130.37|144.61|90.15%|26|3|2|11.54%|\n|99|SO|83.52|79.51|105.04%|17|1|4|5.88%|\n|100|TMUS|182.28|197.95|92.08%|30|7|16|23.33%|\n|101|COP|111.2|141.51|78.58%|21|6|9|28.57%|\n\n\nBased on this table above, I tried to identify some companies that met a few criteria.

This lead me to the following 11 companies:\n**Micron Technologies (MU), Boston Scientific (BSX), Abbot Laboratories (ABT), Merck Scientific (MRK), Stryker (SYK), The Cigna Group (CI), Broadcom (AVGO), Comcast (CMCSA), Honeywell International (HON), Analogue Devices (ADI), and Intuit Inc. (INTU)**\n\nI have about $5,000 I'd like to invest right now and I have half a mind to just put it equally weighted into these 11 companies and just watch it for the next year or two. I'll either do that or put it all in VOO, but I have a feeling that these 11 companies might beat the S&P 500 over the next 24 months.\n\nWhat do you guys think?",

    "title": "Nasdaq, S&P 500 post best day since Feb after Powell signals possible rate cut in Sept",
    "selftext": "The three major U.S. averages on Wednesday ended solidly higher, after Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell said an interest rate cut \"could be on the table as soon as September\" if data on inflation and the labor market continued to improve.\nPowell's remarks, along with a powerful rebound in chip stocks, helped the Nasdaq Composite (COMP:IND) and the benchmark S&P 500 (SP500) post their best intraday gain each since February 22.\n\n\nThe Nasdaq Composite climbed 2.64% to settle at 17,599.40 points, while the S&P 500 closed out the final day of the month with an advance of 1.58% to 5,522.30 points. The blue-chip Dow (DJI) added 0.24% to conclude at 40,843.06 points.\n\n\nU.S. Treasury yields moved lower after Powell's comments, as traders snapped up bonds. The longer-end 10-year yield (US10Y) fell to its lowest level since March, dropping 7 basis points to 4.032%.\n\nEarlier, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) held the federal funds rate steady at 5.25%-5.50%, a largely given outcome.\n\n\nThe attention was on Powell's post-decision press conference, amid hopes that the central bank chief would talk about interest rate cuts in September. And Powell did not disappoint.\n\n\nHe signaled that policymakers could be considering an interest rate cut as soon as September if they continued to see inflation moving quickly or in line with their expectations, growth remaining reasonably strong and the labor market staying consistent with its current conditions.\n\n\nAccording to the CME FedWatch tool, the odds of a 50 basis point rate cut in September climbed after Powell's comments, underscoring the market's confidence that the monetary policy easing cycle was imminent. There is now a 90.5% chance of a 25 bp cut, a 9.5% chance of a 50 bp cut, and a 0.0% chance of a 0 bp cut.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) surged 17%, after Morgan Stanley re-added the chip giant to its top picks list following the stock's recent selloff. In addition, Microsoft and Meta reiterated and increased their capital expenditure investments, signaling further revenue upside for Nvidia. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) climbed 4%, after the world's second-largest maker of personal computer processors issued current quarter revenue guidance that was above consensus estimates.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) slipped 1%, after the tech behemoth's cloud business missed on revenue and its quarterly capital expenditure swelled to $19B.\n\n\nTurning to Wednesday's economic calendar, ADP's jobs report before the opening bell showed private sector employment growing by 122K in July, significantly lower than the consensus figure of 154K. Shortly after, a key gauge of Q2 U.S. labor costs rose lesser than anticipated while also slowing down from the previous quarter.",

    "selftext": "Advanced Micro Devices Inc. gave an upbeat revenue forecast for the current quarter, signaling that its new artificial intelligence processors are helping bolster growth.\n\nRevenue will be roughly $6.7 billion in the third quarter, the chipmaker said in a statement Tuesday. Analysts estimated $6.62 billion on average, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nThe outlook suggests that AMD is making headway in its pursuit of Nvidia Corp., which dominates the market for so-called AI accelerators \u2014 chips used to develop artificial intelligence models. Nvidia has capitalized on booming demand to send its shares and stock price soaring over the past year, becoming the world\u2019s most valuable chipmaker in the process. Now AMD is looking to make inroads with its own lineup, called MI300.\n\nAMD is Nvidia\u2019s nearest rival in the market, but still trailing by a wide margin. The hope is to gain more of the money that data-center operators such as Microsoft Corp. and Meta Platforms Inc. are pouring into the creation of AI tools.\n\nAMD shares rose about 2% in extended trading following the announcement. They had earlier closed at $138.44 in New York, leaving them down 6.1% for the year.\n\nAMD\u2019s quarterly report kicks off a week of earnings updates from large semiconductor makers. Qualcomm Inc., Arm Holdings Plc and Intel Corp. all report numbers this week, and it comes at a delicate time for the chip industry. Investors have been selling shares of the companies after a dramatic run-up earlier this year.\n\nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-07-30/amd-delivers-upbeat-sales-forecast-as-it-shifts-into-ai-chips",

    "selftext": "It has been known for months that Intel's consumer desktop chips of the 13th and 14th generation are widely affected by stability problems. It was thought that these issues were caused by motherboard vendors pushing the chips above the voltage intended by Intel and this was what was causing the chips to fail. [Source](https://videocardz.com/newz/intel-addresses-instability-issues-with-13th-14th-gen-core-k-series-cpus-in-latest-statement)\n\nLast friday some investigative journalism by the youtuber [Level1Techs](https://www.level1techs.com/node/2958) revealed that these issues are not caused by running the chips out of Intel's specifications. He has failure reports from multiple cloud gaming providers which use the relevant chips in large numbers and well within spec. His aggregated data shows a failure rate of 50% per week of continuous running.  [Source](https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/13th-and-14th-gen-intel-cpu-instability-also-hits-servers) , [Further Reading](https://semiwiki.com/forum/index.php?threads/intel-13th-and-14th-gen-core-i9-stability-problems.20614/)\n\n\nI'm mostly making this post because I have not seen this being reported on outside of niche tech circles. Couldn't this mean a huge recall operation for Intel? A company already struggling to profit losing (tens-hundreds of)millions on a recall that also hurts consumer trust. I mean, as far as I understand the findings, this means all high-powered consumer chips Intel has sold for the last 2 years are slowly degrading and a lot of them could fail.

    "title": "The case for Intel from a former bear",
    "selftext": "Disclaimer: I am long from $35 a share; this is my view on $INTC.\n\nI know r/stocks sees a lot of Intel posts, but none of the ones I've seen really describe the Intel story or, frankly, misunderstand the semiconductor industry entirely.\n\nA little background: I was an Intel bear from 2018 to 2024. The reason to have been bearish on the worst semiconductor stock over the past 10 years has been pretty obvious. Intel messed up their manufacturing; they had a 2-3 year lead over TSMC on node technology for over 20 years. But a series of mistakes, 10nm (now Intel 7), and messed-up 7nm (now Intel 4) led to a huge gap with their fabless competition. This allowed Nvidia and AMD, who design chips using software (Cadence and Synopsys) that follow design IP rules set by TSMC, to produce and package the chips.\n\nIntel turned a lead into a 2-year gap. The previous CEO, in 2020, bought TSMC capacity at 3nm to hedge the possibility that Intel would fail again and to allow their products to be more competitive until the foundry side caught up.\n\nThis has led to where we are today. Intel Foundry has low utilization due to outsourcing for next year and is producing uneconomic products, leading to a cash burn. While Intel products for the past 4 years have sold uncompetitive chips.\n\nBut investing is about the future; you are buying today and not the past. So what is coming that will change the story?\n\nLet's deal with the product side of the business first. Right now, the vast majority of Intel products are uncompetitive, which leads to lower volume and lower ASPs. That is changing come the end of this year. Intel products will have Lunar Lake (TSMC 3nm) ultra-low power mobile CPU, and Arrow Lake (TSMC 3nm) desktop and mobile CPU. By all accounts, these products will be extremely competitive and are actually on a superior node to AMD (TSMC 4nm). As the volume of these products ramps up in Q4, Intel ASPs and volume will slowly rise.\n\nIntel also has data center CPUs coming into volume this year: Sierra Forest and Granite Rapids using the Intel 3 node. These products close the gap with AMD in the data center but do not surpass them.\nNext year, Intel products will have Panther Lake (Intel 18A) low-power mobile CPU and Clearwater Forest (Intel 18A) Data Center CPU, which should jump ahead of AMD. There's also a data center GPU, Falcon Shores, but there\u2019s little information on it, so I'm not going to speculate.\n\nSome of you might be asking how I compare TSMC 3nm, Intel 3, Intel 18A, etc. To keep it simple, Intel uses PPA (power, performance, and area) to name its nodes in comparison to TSMC. In general, you should think of nodes as having two factors: density and PPA. TSMC has a comfortable density lead, which helps generally in lower power, and higher PPA is generally better for HPC chips (CPUs). Intel 3 has been documented to have a lower density than TSMC 3nm but a similar PPA. Intel intends to catch up with density on Intel 18A next year to TSMC 3nm and have a lead with PPA vs TSMC 2nm/3nm node.\n\nNow to Intel Foundry's business. Intel Foundry is losing money due to the vast majority of their production being uncompetitive nodes and having much lower volume than in the past since Intel is outsourcing some production to TSMC. Sometime next year, Intel Foundry will begin to see a shift to Intel 18A. This comes with a 3x higher selling price per wafer vs. current nodes. Incremental volume will return to Intel Foundry as Intel shifts back to Intel Foundry from TSMC. Just as Intel products will slowly start to see rising ASPs at the end of this year, you can expect Intel Foundry to slowly climb out of the hole. Each quarter next year, as Intel 18A ramps up will lead to lower losses. Intel also wants external customers and has some booked, with Microsoft being the largest single customer. Intel Foundry is competing against TSMC, whose similar node to 18A is their 2nm. TSMC 2nm will ramp up at the end of 2025 and won\u2019t have real products until sometime in 2026. This gives Intel a nice window to demonstrate to potential customers that 18A is competitive and has good yields. For a follow-on node of 14A using ASML High NA. Intel does not expect to be #1 Foundry by volume, nor do they have to be with its current valuation.\n\nUltimately the biggest downside is Intel messes up 18A. Then I would sell, and buy $AMD. I think over the next 3 years. Intel can be north of $100 a share. The semiconductor industry operates with a large lag, Intel's current results are being driven by decisions made in early 2021. There is a lot more I could write about, but I don't want this to be too long. Let me know in comments, if you are interested.",

    "title": "Riding the AMD Wave",
    "selftext": "Let me give you the lowdown on what\u2019s going on with AMD and how I'm playing it.\n\n# Current Play:\n\nSo, AMD's been moving\u2014up 0.8% on Friday, to be exact. It hit a high of $169.45 and settled at $168.16. But here\u2019s the kicker: only 14.5 million shares traded hands, way below the usual 66.8 million. That\u2019s a 78% drop in volume! Something\u2019s brewing.\n\n# Analyst Chatter:\n\nThe street\u2019s buzzing. Here\u2019s the breakdown:\n\n* **Citigroup:** Slashed their target from $192 to $176, still says \u201cbuy.\u201d\n* **Morgan Stanley:** Cut theirs from $193 to $177, also keeps an \u201coverweight\u201d rating.\n* **KeyCorp:** Dropped from $270 to $230, sticking with \u201coverweight.\u201d\n* **DZ Bank:** Upped to a \u201cbuy\u201d with a $190 target.\n* **Wedbush:** Stays \u201coutperform\u201d with a $200 target.\n\nOverall, it\u2019s a solid \u201cModerate Buy\u201d from 28 out of 31 analysts, with an average target of $185.26. They\u2019re mostly bullish, with a couple of cautious voices in the mix.\n\n# Financial Pulse:\n\nEarnings came in at $0.62 per share, just a hair above the consensus of $0.61. Revenue\u2019s at $5.47 billion, a tiny miss against the $5.48 billion estimate but up 2.2% year-over-year. Not earth-shattering, but steady.\n\nKey ratios to watch:\n\n* **Debt-to-equity:** 0.03.\n* **Quick ratio:** 1.92.\n* **Current ratio:** 2.64. Market cap sits at $271.33 billion, with a P/E ratio of 246.87. The PEG ratio is 1.92, and it\u2019s got a beta of 1.69, so it\u2019s got some juice in a volatile market.\n\n# Insider Moves:\n\nNow, insiders are moving. **CEO Lisa Su** unloaded 125,000 shares for about $24.4 million, and **EVP Mark Papermaster** sold 16,200 shares for around $2.7 million. Total insider sales in the past three months hit about $30.1 million. They still hold 0.73% of the stock. Could be normal cashing out, but always worth noting.\n\n# Institutional Maneuvers:\n\nBig players are piling in:\n\n* **Norges Bank:** Dropped $3.4 billion into AMD.\n* **DZ BANK AG:** Boosted their stake by over 800%.\n* **International Assets Investment Management LLC** and **Capital World Investors:** Both made hefty buys, each around half a billion.\n* **Price T Rowe Associates Inc.:** Upped their game, now holding $4.08 billion worth.\n\n# My Strategy:\n\n**Technical Setup:**\n\n* **50-Day Moving Average:** $161.33.\n* **200-Day Moving Average:** $161.36. Key levels to watch: the previous close at $166.78 and the moving averages.\n\n**Entry Points:**\n\n* **Short-Term:** I\u2019m eyeing a dip around $165. That\u2019s close to the 50-day moving average and looks like a sweet spot for a bounce.\n* **Long-Term:** If it slides to the 200-day moving average ($161.36) or even below, it\u2019s time to load up.\n\n**Exit Strategy:**\n\n* **Short-Term Gains:** I\u2019m looking to cash out around $176 to $177, right in line with Citigroup and Morgan Stanley\u2019s targets. Quick win.\n* **Long-Term Hold:** Eyeing around $200, where Wedbush\u2019s target lies. That\u2019s a juicy exit if it runs up there.\n\n# Market Conditions:\n\nKeep an ear to the ground for earnings and industry news. The semiconductor space can flip on a dime with supply chain issues or new tech breakthroughs.\n\n# The Bottom Line:\n\nAMD\u2019s got some strong fundamentals and analyst support, despite some recent target cuts. It\u2019s a play worth considering, with a potential sweet spot for entry at $165 and a target exit anywhere between $176 and $200. Stay sharp, and let\u2019s see how this ride goes!\n\nCheers to smart trading! \ud83e\udd42",

    "selftext": "Nvidia on Sunday unveiled its next generation of artificial intelligence chips to succeed the previous model, which was announced just months earlier in March.\n\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang announced the new AI chip architecture, dubbed \u201cRubin,\u201d ahead of the COMPUTEX tech conference in Taipei.\n\nRubin comes months after the March announcement of the upcoming \u201cBlackwell\u201d model, which is still in production and expected to ship to customers later in 2024.\n\nHuang\u2019s announcement of Rubin appears to quicken the company\u2019s already-accelerated pace of AI chip advancement.\n\nNvidia has pledged to release new AI chip models on a \u201cone-year rhythm,\u201d as Huang put it on Sunday. The company had previously been operating on a slower two-year update timeline for chips.\n\nThe turnaround from Blackwell to Rubin was a matter of less than three months, underscoring the competitive frenzy in the AI chip market and Nvidia\u2019s sprint to preserve its dominant spot.\n\nAMD and Intel are two major competitors working to catch up, though their gross margins trailed Nvidia\u2019s in the most recent fiscal quarter. Companies like Microsoft, Google and Amazon are also vying for Nvidia\u2019s top spot, even as they are simultaneously some of Nvidia\u2019s biggest patrons. A flurry of startups are also working to enter the space.\n\n\u201cToday, we\u2019re at the cusp of a major shift in computing,\u201d Huang said Sunday. \u201cWith our innovations in AI and accelerated computing, we\u2019re pushing the boundaries of what\u2019s possible and driving the next wave of technological advancement.\u201d\n\nThe Rubin chip platform will have new GPUs, the crucial graphic processing technology that helps train and launch AI systems. It will come with other new features like a central processor called \u201cVera,\u201d though the Sunday announcement did not provide many details.\n\nShares of Nvidia were relatively flat at Friday\u2019s market close with shares trading at $1,096.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/02/nvidia-next-generation-ai-chips-rubin-blackwell.html",

    "title": "Microsoft announces new PCs with AI chips from Qualcomm ",
    "selftext": "Microsoft is touting new computers with advanced chips designed to run artificial intelligence features of software for Windows, without quickly using up battery life.\n\nThe company on Monday announced Surface Laptop and a Surface Pro tablet with a Qualcomm chip that can run some AI tasks without an internet connection. Other computer makers like Lenovo, Dell, HP, Asus, Acer and Samsung are also launching AI-ready PCs powered by Qualcomm\u2019s Snapdragon X Elite and X Plus processors, which promise longer battery life and will run Microsoft\u2019s Copilot AI chatbot.\n\nThe computers adhere to Microsoft\u2019s new Copilot+ standard that feature a minimum amount of performance, storage and memory. Copilot+ PCs with AMD and Intel chips will follow, Microsoft said during a press keynote on its campus in Redmond, Washington. The PCs will be able to translate audio, recommend responses to incoming messages and suggest changes in the Settings app, and even talk with people about what\u2019s on screen.\n\nCopilot+ PCs will start at $999. Microsoft is accepting pre-orders as of Monday, and the devices will become available in June.\n\nA Recall feature will be able to search through a log of previous actions on PCs. Recall relies on AI models that run directly on the device, so it can run offline, and an index of the data never goes to remote servers. AI models will be able to generate images based on written descriptions as well as drawings.\n\nMicrosoft is banking on Qualcomm\u2019s energy-efficient Arm-based chips that can handle AI models to defend its Windows franchise. Apple has gained market share in PC shipments with MacBooks containing its Arm-based chips, having moved away from Intel, the top provider of computer processors.\n\nMicrosoft is expanding its effort to surround consumers and business users with ChatGPT-like capabilities. OpenAI, backed by Microsoft, released the ChatGPT chatbot in late 2022, and it quickly took off as a tool for quickly obtaining computer-generated poems, email drafts and summaries of historical events.\n\nOther large technology companies, including Microsoft, soon started augmenting their products with generative AI. A Copilot chatbot drawing on ChatGPT\u2019s underlying AI models came to the Bing search engine, along with the Windows 10 and 11 operating systems. Those with Office productivity software subscriptions could pay extra to have a Copilot refer to their documents for written responses.\n\nThe GPT-4 model inside ChatGPT has only done its necessary computing work in Microsoft\u2019s Azure cloud. The new PCs can run some AI models locally without an internet connection. The launch comes nearly four months after Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella told analysts on the company\u2019s earnings call that \u201cin 2024, AI will become a first-class part of every PC.\u201d\n\nMicrosoft has had little success in getting people to adopt Arm-based Windows computers, which haven\u2019t always performed as well as PCs running Intel or AMD chips. Certain applications have been incompatible.\n\nRunning generative AI locally means computers will need more power, and strong battery life becomes more critical. That might make Windows on Arm more compelling.\n\nAnalysts with Morgan Stanley expect Arm systems to be 14% of all Windows PC shipments in 2026, up from 0% in 2023, according to a note distributed to clients earlier this month.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/20/microsoft-qualcomm-ai-pcs-snapdragon-arm-processors.html",

I understand the risks and taxes involved, and I don\u2019t mind some volatility since I\u2019m still learning.\n\nThe main stocks I\u2019m considering are:\n\t\u2022\tAMD \u2013 strong potential if they land new deals and improve their software side.\n\t\u2022\tUNH \u2013 looks undervalued; the investigation doesn\u2019t seem too damaging, and the stock hasn\u2019t fully corrected since the murder news.\n\t\u2022\tSHOP.TO \u2013 e-commerce is still growing, and last quarter\u2019s earnings beat gave it a strong rebound.\n\nI\u2019m also keeping an eye on GOOGL and researching NVO.\n\nI suspect a larger market correction is coming eventually, but I still think there\u2019s time to benefit from the current bullish trend.\n\nTL;DR: New investor, already in an ETF, now looking for individual stocks that can realistically return 15\u201320% yearly over the next few years.

    "selftext": "seismic event just happened in the semiconductor world, and it has major implications for investors. NVIDIA and Intel announced a historic collaboration, with NVIDIA investing $5 billion in Intel and forming a joint venture to co-develop new chips for AI and personal computing.\n\nThis partnership is a big deal because it brings together two of the biggest players in the industry, which immediately sent shockwaves through the market. While Intel's stock saw a massive jump of up to 30%, competitors like AMD saw their shares drop by over 9% in initial trading.\n\nAnalysts are now debating the long-term impact on the competitive landscape.\n\n1) For AMD: The concern is that the new partnership could create a powerful, integrated offering that directly challenges AMD's products in both the data center and consumer markets. This move may put pressure on AMD to accelerate its own product launches and strategies.\n\n2) For the Alliance: The deal could be seen as a way for Intel to get a much-needed lifeline and a direct path into the AI space, while NVIDIA gains a massive partner to expand its ecosystem.\n\nWhat's your take? Is this the beginning of the end for AMD, or will this simply force them to innovate faster and make the market even more competitive?",

But if you listen to defense experts, geopolitical analysts, and even governments, they see it as a real risk with real probability. This isn\u2019t just noise or fearmongering.\n\nTSMC is one of the most important companies in the global semiconductor supply chain. If conflict breaks out in the Taiwan Strait, it won\u2019t just be bad for them. It could disrupt the entire industry. ASML would lose a key customer. Nvidia, AMD, Apple, and Qualcomm would all be cut off from advanced chip supply. And yes, TSMC is building fabs in the US and Japan, but those won\u2019t match Taiwan\u2019s capabilities for years.\n\nThe bullish projections for the chip sector almost always assume political stability around Taiwan and China. But what if that assumption fails?\n\nI\u2019m not saying semiconductors are a bad investment. They\u2019ve been some of the top performers over the past decade. But I do think many portfolios are overexposed to this single point of geopolitical risk.\n\nWe can\u2019t predict macro events. But we can choose how much risk we take. Personally, I try to avoid putting too much weight in the chip sector. I prefer companies that would be less impacted if a worst-case scenario plays out. Sure, the returns might be lower, but so are the potential losses.\n\nJust some thoughts. Curious to hear how others are thinking about this. Is the market underestimating the Taiwan risk?",

    "selftext": "Let me preface by saying everything below is for folks investing in individual stocks/trying to generate excess return and learn about markets - if you\u2019ve got a set it and forget it in index funds, that\u2019s the right call for most people and this post isn\u2019t for you.\n\nDecided to post again on moves I\u2019m making / have already made with my portfolio starting last week and extending for the next couple weeks through earnings. I\u2019ve gotten some positive feedback / requests from newer/younger investors to provide my investment perspectives, so posting this in the hopes it helps some folks build a mental model for how to think about markets and hopefully not to get run over (avoiding big losses is as, if not more important than making big gains in investing). I studied Classics as well as Economics in college, and am always reminded when investing of the importance of stoicism (or in market parlance, mean reversion). Things are almost never as good or as dire as they seem and knowing this influences how I think about markets and how I look to profit through changes in sentiment and market cycles.\n\nFirst, it\u2019s critical to understand this isn\u2019t a doomsday post but rather it\u2019s important as individual investors to understand market sentiment. In the words of Warren Buffet \u201cbe fearful when others are greedy.\u201d Not recommending anyone dump their whole portfolio tomorrow or enter a costly short position, but given we\u2019ve had a 26% run up in 3 months (and much more in certain AI stocks), it\u2019s time to start thinking about taking profits on positions that have materially run up and getting out of positions where valuations are insanely stretched (e.g, if you\u2019re in PLTR, TSLA, Cloud Flare, etc). I\u2019m personally exiting a number of positions and increasing my cash position to ~20-30%.\n\nPositions I\u2019m trimming/exiting:\nAMD (out)\nBTC (trimmed to <2% of portfolio)\nUber (waiting on earnings to trim/exit)\nDraft Kings (waiting on earnings to trim)\nCEG (out)\nGoogle (still very long, holding core position but selling my long-dated options over the next few weeks as we hopefully bleed up toward $200 post a very strong earnings quarter - was my single biggest position).\n\nSimple reasons behind this portfolio rebalancing:\n1. Several AI stocks I invested in back/before April have run up materially and now are a larger portion of my overall portfolio (increasing portfolio volatility and risk). Have to recognize many of these stocks are priced at or near perfection at this point. It wouldn\u2019t be shocking to see some air come out of this balloon in the short term, though I do believe in the longer term trend.\n2. September historically is the worst performing month for the S&P, coupled with the fact that we\u2019re starting to see peak euphoria tendencies (meme stock rallies, wild IPO rides, huge option bets by retail investors who have limited to no experience), spells for me time to reduce my risk.\n3. The market right now is priced for the rosiest of scenarios. It seems to believe the economy will remain resilient AND rates will be cut ~2 times this year. I think one of these is likely to be true, but these scenarios are likely to be mutually exclusive, I.e, economy stays resilient and Powell keeps rates steady or economy starts to falter and we see the cuts, either way we surprise to the downside vs expectations. The market is also heavily weighted to the AI trade and is now above 30x earnings (average is closer to 22x the past 30 years)\n4. I think the impacts of tariffs haven\u2019t played out in the economic data yet (there\u2019s a lag on these policies as they\u2019re enacted, enforced, and inventory clears) and wouldn\u2019t shock me to see some prints in the fall that start to rattle markets (given where we\u2019re at now from a historical P/E perspective it won\u2019t take much). I don\u2019t think it\u2019s Aug 1 that\u2019ll send us but some higher CPI / lower consumer spending/confidence prints in the early fall that spell weakening economy or rate cuts being off the table.\n\nThis is all to say, at a market level, we\u2019ve hit euphoria and I believe the balance of risk is now skewed to the down side. As a long-term investor, I\u2019m always long the market but to different degrees, but for all these reasons, I\u2019m trimming my nosebleed valuation stocks, adding to those with more reasonable valuations, and building a cash position. If we get a 5-10%+ dip (which I think is reasonable given the markets sensitivity to a 50 bps change in rate expectations), I\u2019ll start layering into select positions again. As always, these are my views, not investment advice. Good luck out there!\n",

    "selftext": "I read Jensen Huang's biograph lately(The Thinking Machine) and I found some interesting stories in it. I wanted to share with you. \n\n1.When Jensen Huang immigrated to the U.S. as a kid, he ended up in a small rural town and got bullied pretty badly. But instead of reacting with defiance or lashing out, he just smiled and brushed it off. Calm and quiet resilience.\n\nHe later said he got into physical training thanks to a roommate, and he started doing tons of push-ups. Eventually, his build changed and that might\u2019ve naturally put an end to the bullying.\n\t\n2.He was really good at table tennis. He seriously considered going pro during his school years. Even after founding NVIDIA, he kept a ping pong table in the office, tucked away in the corner.\n\n3.He\u2019s always been this upbeat, warm-hearted kind of guy. He didn\u2019t like cutting people loose. That\u2019s why NVIDIA\u2019s hiring process was notoriously tough. His philosophy was that if you hire carefully, you won\u2019t need to fire.\n\nAt a public meeting one day, he pressed a junior employee, asking, \u201cWhat value are you delivering here at NVIDIA compared to what you\u2019re paid?\u201d The guy was crushed by it. But later, when that same employee was diagnosed with a rare illness, Jensen tried to cover his treatment personally from his own pocket.\n\n4.He wasn\u2019t like this back in his AMD days, but once he became a CEO, \u201cHwaung's rage\u201d became a thing. Not in a toxic but more like explosive passion when he disagrees with something. People say that \"If you\u2019ve experienced his rage, you\u2019ve become part of the inner circle at NVIDIA\"\n\n5.Around 2014(I don't remember exactly) a junior engineer who was lazy but quite creative noticed a potential link between deep learning and NVIDIA chips. Despite having a relatively low performance record, the guy went straight to Jensen and pitched his idea with everything he had. Maybe he figured he had nothing to lose.\n\nJensen listened. Then he ripped the roadmap off the wall and declared, \u201cThis is our future.\u201d\nFrom that moment on, NVIDIA bet everything on AI. CUDA became the heart of their strategy, and they poured everything into developing GPUs optimized for machine learning.\n",

    "selftext": "I\u2019ve had TSM in the portfolio for a while now (wrote a deep dive on it ages ago which still holds up). Earlier this year, when everyone freaked out over tariffs and the stock dipped to \\~$145, I flagged it as a chance to load up. I bumped it to over 5% of the portfolio.\n\nFast forward to Q2 2025 earnings \u2026yeah. No regrets.\n\nThe numbers slapped:\n\n* Revenue: $31.67B, up 54% YoY \ud83e\udd2f\n* Net income: $9.2B, up 60%\n* EPS: $2.47 (beat by $0.16)\n* Gross margin: 58.6% (up big from 54.1%)\n* Full-year revenue growth now expected to hit 30% (up from 20% earlier)\n\nThe stock popped. And it should\u2019ve.\n\nWhat\u2019s driving it? AI. Lots of it.\n\nTSMC\u2019s HPC segment now makes up 60% of total revenue. That\u2019s up from 52% last year. Meanwhile, smartphones are just 27% of the pie now.\n\nThe 3nm node is 24% of wafer revenue already. That\u2019s up from 15% last quarter. Nvidia, AMD, Apple, etc. are all over it. The 5nm node is still king (36%), but 3nm is catching up fast.\n\nRevenue from the U.S. now makes up 75% of total sales. China? Just 9%. So much for \u201cdependence on China.\u201d\n\nEarnings call had some juicy bits too:\n\nBiggest Q&A themes were:\n\n1. Can TSM actually keep up with all this AI demand?\n2. When are AI customers moving to bleeding-edge nodes like 2nm and A16?\n\nManagement basically said: yes, fabs are ramping, we\u2019re good. And yes, AI clients are *absolutely* moving to the newest stuff sooner due to power efficiency. These data centers eat electricity like crazy. CEO said the biggest constraint for AI players is power. A16 (coming 2026) is supposed to be 20% more efficient than 2nm, which already beats 3nm.\n\nAlso, about 30% of their future advanced node capacity will be in Arizona, not Taiwan. That\u2019s a pretty clear signal they\u2019re hedging geo risks.\n\nCouple other things:\n\n* Q3 rev guide: $31.8B to $33B.\n* FX headwinds (strong NT$) hit margins a bit, but they still see 53%+ long-term gross margins.\n* Capex for 2025: \\~$40B.\n* They called out tariffs and weak consumer markets as risks, but AI growth more than offsets that\n\nIf you  want more details on my TSM thesis, I wrote a full deep dive back in March (with way more context, valuation, risks, etc):\n\n[https://www.beatingthetide.com/p/tsmc-stock-why-this-semiconductor](https://www.beatingthetide.com/p/tsmc-stock-why-this-semiconductor)",

I feel like I have never done enough research about the companies. I am constantly anxious about my portfolio. Which stocks should I hold? How should I manage the position? Therefore, I tried to study on various technical analysis trading strategies and try a lot of algo trading strategies so that I can have a fully mechanic system to make decision. Then I found that it is very difficult to beat s&p 500. Even if I can do it I think it's not worth the effort because the excess return is not that much and I can not guarantee that the system will consistently outperform the market so it's still walking on thin ice and still kind of discrteional because I need to make decisions on adjusting the strategy.\n\nSo two year ago I decided that I should just buy and hold the stock market index and get rid of all the stress.

I planned to stop at 2M net worth so with 4x leverage it's another (2M/800k-1)/4\\*100%=37.5% and I'll be set. This april I blew up my account because I added on the way down and ended up overleveraged and got margin called. I went from 800k to less than 50k and realized that it's not really a sustainable strategy. Well, deep down I knew it's not sustainable but I wanted to make use of this post-2022 bull market cycle to the fullest because I hate investing so much that I want to make money faster and then sit with 5\\~8% return for the rest of my life.\n\nAfter this incident, I return to steady investment and am considering go back to active investing and trading. Currently I just hold SPY, QQQ, and NVDA. But I find that I beat myself up for taking profits too early or not buying more or not buying any other rallying stock like AVGO, AMD, and a ton of others. I get really mad to the point it affects every aspect of my life. Sometimes I think to myself is it really worth it if investing makes me financially successful but ruin my overall life. I am looking for any suggestion. Much appreciated.\n\nPS. I want to clarify that I am not sharing my story to just rant about my tramatized experience but to explain my thought process and show that I've tried many approaches in investing and that I've always tried very very hard to outperform the market. So I think I need more advice on mindset and psychology rather than \"find a strategy\" or \"just buy and hold spy\" kind of stuff. I am still open to this advice but I need more psychological aspect of it.",

    "title": "Nvidia: Rising Competition, Valuation Concerns, and Shifting AI Investments",
    "selftext": "* Nvidia peaked in June 2024 and has been in a sideways correction.\n* DeepSeek's AI model and high Nvidia valuation caused a sharp stock decline.\n* Cloud companies' weak performance reduced AI chip investments.\n* AMD and tech giants are developing cheaper AI chips, pressuring Nvidia.\n* Nvidia remains dominant but faces increasing competition and valuation concerns.\n\n\n\nIn January 2025, Chinese AI company DeepSeek made a bold move by launching a new AI model at a fraction of the cost typically required. This raised concerns about Nvidia\u2019s market monopoly, leading to a historic one-day market cap loss of nearly $600 billion. The stock had already been struggling after peaking in June 2024, showing signs of a broader correction phase. Weak cloud profits and reduced AI hardware investments from major cloud companies added to the downturn. Despite Nvidia consistently beating earnings estimates, its high valuation has investors questioning its long-term sustainability. The company\u2019s $2.8 trillion valuation, trading at 12.5x forward revenue for FY 2027, has been flagged as a major risk.\n\nNvidia\u2019s latest earnings exceeded analyst expectations, beating EPS estimates by $0.04 and revenue estimates by $1.19 billion. Annual EPS growth remains strong, but the stock failed to rally due to external market conditions. Major hyperscalers like Amazon, Google, and Microsoft underperformed in cloud revenue, signaling a slowdown in AI chip investments. Investors are concerned about weakening demand as new competitors introduce cheaper AI models. Nvidia forecasts a 56% YoY revenue increase for FY 2026 and 21% for FY 2027, yet risks remain as the AI chip market becomes more competitive.\n\nAmazon, Microsoft, and Google account for nearly half of Nvidia\u2019s data center sales. Their investments in Nvidia\u2019s AI chips have powered cloud AI workloads, but recent underperformance in cloud revenue is forcing them to reconsider expensive AI hardware spending. Companies are increasingly looking for alternatives to Nvidia\u2019s GPUs, such as in-house chips and more affordable AI models. AI training, which once required millions of dollars in Nvidia GPUs, can now be done for as little as $50 using new techniques. Alibaba\u2019s latest AI model has surpassed DeepSeek, challenging Nvidia\u2019s dominance. With cloud growth slowing, hyperscalers are cutting back, further threatening Nvidia\u2019s future revenue.\n\nCompetition in the AI hardware space is intensifying as more companies shift away from Nvidia\u2019s expensive GPUs. DeepSeek\u2019s R1 model is now available on AWS and Azure, gaining rapid adoption due to its low cost. Alibaba\u2019s Qwen2.5-Max is reportedly more advanced, further pressuring Nvidia. Research from Stanford and the University of Washington has demonstrated that powerful AI models can be trained for just $50, proving that high-end GPUs are no longer necessary. Major tech firms like Google, Amazon, and Microsoft are investing in custom AI chips, reducing reliance on Nvidia and reshaping the market.\n\nAMD is rapidly expanding its AI chip business, positioning itself as a strong competitor. CEO Lisa Su expects tens of billions in AI chip revenue annually, and the company is accelerating the launch of its Instinct MI350 to compete with Nvidia\u2019s flagship chips. Other companies, including OpenAI, Google, and Amazon, are developing their own AI chips to reduce dependency on Nvidia. These alternatives are proving to be more efficient and cost-effective, which could threaten Nvidia\u2019s ability to maintain its premium pricing and dominant market position.\n\nWall Street remains skeptical about Nvidia\u2019s valuation. The stock is trading at 12.5x forward revenue for FY 2027, with a high forward P/E ratio of 25x FY 2026 EPS estimates. Comparatively, Alphabet trades at 18.5x forward P/E, making Nvidia look significantly more expensive. With Amazon, Google, and Microsoft seeing weaker cloud revenue growth, Wall Street is pushing them to cut capital expenditures. If hyperscalers reduce AI chip purchases, Nvidia\u2019s revenue projections may be revised downward, increasing concerns about the sustainability of its high valuation.\n\nThe future of Nvidia\u2019s stock price remains uncertain. A prolonged correction could continue as the AI market undergoes structural changes. The company faces mounting competition from AMD, DeepSeek, and custom AI chips, which could erode its market share. If hyperscalers continue to scale back on AI hardware spending, Nvidia\u2019s revenue growth could take a hit. Stock valuation comparisons highlight potential downside risks, with Nvidia trading at 12.3x forward revenue for FY 2027. Forecasts for Nvidia\u2019s revenue range from $179 billion to $334 billion, highlighting the uncertainty surrounding the company\u2019s growth potential. While Nvidia remains a dominant force, the increasing number of competitors and shifting industry trends suggest that its upside may be limited.\n\nFinancial data reinforces Nvidia\u2019s strong market presence, with a 78% YoY revenue growth in Q4, reaching $39.3 billion, driven by a 93% increase in data center revenue. Analysts estimate Nvidia\u2019s forward revenue between $179 billion and $334 billion, reflecting its market strength. However, Nvidia\u2019s high forward P/E ratio of 40\u201350x, compared to Alphabet\u2019s 20\u201325x, indicates stretched valuations that may not be sustainable. Despite its leadership in AI chips, the emergence of alternatives is forcing Nvidia to adapt or risk losing ground.\n\nBroader industry trends indicate a shift in AI and semiconductor investments. Hyperscalers are prioritizing efficiency over Nvidia\u2019s expensive GPUs, turning to cost-effective AI models from DeepSeek, Alibaba, and academic institutions. Geopolitical factors may also impact Nvidia\u2019s supply chain and stock price. Market performance suggests a shift in investor sentiment, with Microsoft\u2019s stock down 20% from its peak despite the S&P 500 rising 10%. The AI sector is evolving, and Nvidia\u2019s dominance, built on CUDA, faces growing competition from rising alternatives.\n\n**TL;DR:** Nvidia\u2019s stock has struggled since peaking in June 2024 due to rising competition from DeepSeek and AMD, reduced cloud investments, and concerns over high valuation. Despite strong earnings, Wall Street remains skeptical about its long-term growth. AI hardware spending is shifting towards cost-effective solutions, putting pressure on Nvidia\u2019s pricing power. While the company remains dominant, increasing competition and hyperscaler cutbacks could limit its upside potential.\n\n",

I\u2019ve heard, however, that both Amazon and Google are creating their own custom chips. If they scale up their chip-making operations, it could lead to needing to purchase less GPU\u2019s from Nvidia. \n\nAlso, making up such a large part of sales, doesn\u2019t this give them increased bargaining power? It would seem that these companies are in a position of leverage to negotiate better pricing from Nvidia, which could reduce margins. \n\nLastly, there\u2019s a question of competition. Again, I don\u2019t know much, but it seems that Intel and AMD are aggressively improving their AI hardware offerings. If they gain market share, Nvidia\u2019s largest customers could look to start diversifying their suppliers. \n\nI\u2019d love to get the Nvidia investors perspective on such a large part of revenues being concentrated in 3 customers.

    "selftext": "About a year ago, I took over my traditional IRA which had been professionally managed for a good while. It has a wide range of individual stocks like AAPL, AMD, AMZN, AVGO, AXP, BRKB, COST, CRM ... V, WBA, WMT (28 stocks and funds) for example, with share quantities ranging from 1 to 20+ for the individual stocks. Most, have really nice returns, but the quantity of each tends to be so small I question whether it would be wise to sell most and invest in a mix of SCHD, FXAIX, SCHG, FTEC, and FBGRX. I've already cleaned up a bunch of small quantity positions, but there are still a ton of them. I reinvested the proceeds into the funds above.\n\nWould it make sense to sell most of these remaining small positions and concentrate those funds in selected ETFs and MFs as mentioned above? I've pretty much settled other Roth and IRA accounts into a mix of S&P 500, dividend ETFs, and growth funds. But this one account remains to be cleaned up and is worth around $135k-ish currently. \n\nI'm not generally a fan of bond funds, but do have about 6% in FXNAX. I've consolidated other stocks I sold into FXAIX and SCHD, about 27% and 29% respectively. And I put some in several growth funds too like FBGRX and FTEC, about 16% between them. So the remaining 20+ stocks comprise maybe 20-25% of the account. While I kinda like having BRKB, MSFT, NFLX, NVDA, META, etc., the share quantities are so low that I wonder if I would be better off selling them and reinvesting them in my core ETFs and MFs above. \n\nFor the record, our current income is from Social Security, RMDs, and my wife who will likely work for 6 to 8 more years. I've been retired for years. The majority of our funds are in different Roth and 403b Roth and 403b IRA accounts. The account in question above is a rollover from a job years ago.",

    "title": "Why Estimates For NVIDIA's Q4 Revenue Could Be Dead Wrong: The Case for NVIDIA's Next Blowout Report",
    "selftext": "TL;DR: Estimating NVIDIA's Q4 FY2025 revenue from the capex of its four largest customers using linear regression results in an estimated revenue of $49.265 billion which is significantly higher than Wall Street's expectations of $38.13 billion.\n\nThis is the author\u2019s opinion only, not financial advice, and is intended for entertainment purposes only. The author holds a beneficial long position in NVIDIA Corporation. The author receives no compensation for writing this article and has no business relationship with any of the companies mentioned. The following analysis has been carefully conducted, but numbers or calculations may be incorrect, leading to potentially incorrect results.\n\nNVIDIA will report its\u00a0Q4 FY2025 financial results on February 26. The consensus estimate for NVIDIA's Q4 revenue is\u00a0$38.13 billion. In the past two weeks, Microsoft, Meta, Alphabet, and Amazon, NVIDIA's largest customers, have reported earnings.\u00a0One of the biggest headlines\u00a0was the announcement that these four companies plan to spend approximately $320 billion in capital expenditures (capex) through 2025:\n\nYear\t|Meta\t|Alphabet\t|Microsoft\t|Amazon\t| Sum 2024 ($bn)\t|39.2\t|52.6\t|75.6\t|77.8\t|245.2 2025 (planned, $bn)\t|65.0\t|75.0\t|80.0\t|100.0\t|320.0\n\nMuch less attention was paid to the significant increase in capital expenditures by these companies last quarter:\n\nCategory\t|Meta\t|Alphabet\t|Microsoft\t|Amazon\t| Sum Last quarter reported ($bn)\t|14.425\t|14.276\t|15.804\t|27.834\t|72.339 Previous quarter ($bn)\t|8.258\t|13.061\t|14.923\t|22.620\t|58.862 Change from previous quarter\t|+74.7%\t|+9.3%\t|+5.9%\t|+23.1%\t|+22.90%\n\nSince these 4 companies are the largest buyers of NVIDIA's GPUs, it makes sense to examine a correlation between these companies' quarterly capex and NVIDIA's quarterly revenue. For the last 7 quarters, we get a strong correlation coefficient of 0.95 (Pearson correlation). Now, if we use linear regression to estimate NVIDIA's revenue for the yet-to-be-reported Q4 2025 based on this data, we get quarterly revenue of $49.265 billion, which is more than $10 billion above the consensus analyst estimate.\n\nOf course, NVIDIA's GPUs account for only a portion of these 4 companies' reported capex. However, given the recent disappointing results from NVIDIA's competitor AMD, that portion may have increased. It could also be that a lot of datacenters have been built now and these costs were already incurred in previous quarters, leaving more capex for NVIDIA's GPUs - and the newly built datacenters should now have plenty of room for the upcoming Blackwell generation. Of course, companies like Alphabet are also building their own AI chips, but\u00a0they are much less cost-effective\u00a0than NVIDIA's Hopper generation and especially the upcoming Blackwell generation. Or as\u00a0Amazon CEO Andy Jassy put it on an analyst call last week: \"most AI compute has been driven by Nvidia chips, and we obviously have a deep partnership with Nvidia and will for as long as we can see into the future.\" All in all, one could assume that the share of capex from these 4 companies going to NVIDIA may have even increased in the last quarter.\n\nIn addition, there are other major buyers of NVIDIA's GPUs: xAI, for example, has also purchased tens of thousands of NVIDIA's GPUs and built the massive supercomputer\u00a0Colossus with 100,000 NVIDIA Hopper GPUs. Another massive buyer of NVIDIA's GPUs has just formed with Project Stargate, which plans to invest a staggering\u00a0$500 billion in new AI infrastructure\u00a0over the next four years. All of this should continue to be a strong wind in NVIDIA's sails.",

The H100\u2019s architecture enables AI models to train at unprecedented speeds, while the H800 variant meets regulatory requirements in markets like China. The evolution from the A100 to the H100 has significantly accelerated AI capabilities, with GPT-3 models learning four times faster than before. Nvidia\u2019s market strength is reinforced by deep integration with tech giants like Google, Amazon, and Microsoft, ensuring continued demand for its products. As AI models become more sophisticated and data-intensive, Nvidia\u2019s GPUs remain central to pushing the limits of what AI can achieve.\n\nDeepSeek\u2019s AI model V3 has disrupted the industry by achieving high-performance AI training on Nvidia\u2019s H800 chips at significantly lower costs. Traditionally, training advanced AI models has required billions in investment, but DeepSeek\u2019s approach challenges this assumption, demonstrating that high-level AI training can be done with minimal resources. This efficiency could lead major tech firms to question Nvidia\u2019s high pricing, pressuring the company\u2019s ability to maintain its premium margins. If DeepSeek\u2019s success encourages more companies to seek cost-effective alternatives, Nvidia may need to justify its premium pricing or risk losing market share.\n\nDespite its strong position, Nvidia\u2019s financial foundation has key vulnerabilities. Nearly half of its data center revenue comes from a handful of major tech firms, including Microsoft and Meta\u2014companies that are now investing in developing their own AI chips to reduce dependency on Nvidia. While Nvidia\u2019s dominance in both software and hardware makes it difficult to replace, emerging competitors like AMD and DeepSeek are introducing cost-effective alternatives. DeepSeek, for example, trained its model with only $5 million, a fraction of the billions typically required for Nvidia-powered training. With a P/E ratio three times the industry average, Nvidia\u2019s valuation remains highly sensitive to changes in AI spending and broader market trends. A slowdown in AI-related investments or increased competition could significantly impact Nvidia\u2019s stock price.\n\nFor years, Nvidia was synonymous with AI growth, with investors believing that any advancement in AI would translate directly into gains for Nvidia. However, this perception is shifting. The emergence of cost-effective AI models and alternative chip suppliers, including DeepSeek, AMD, Google, and Amazon, challenges Nvidia\u2019s \u201cThere Is No Alternative\u201d (TINA) status. Concerns about pricing, licensing restrictions, and geopolitical factors, including U.S. government restrictions on chip exports, further complicate Nvidia\u2019s outlook. Investors are increasingly questioning whether Nvidia can sustain its premium pricing in a market where competition is growing, leading to potential valuation recalibration.\n\nThe AI industry is undergoing rapid transformation, with cost-efficiency becoming a critical factor in decision-making. Nvidia\u2019s high-end GPUs have long been the gold standard, but rising costs are prompting companies to explore alternatives. AMD\u2019s MI300 series, for example, offers competitive AI processing power at lower costs, making it an attractive alternative for firms looking to diversify suppliers. Broadcom is also gaining traction in AI networking, while DeepSeek\u2019s focus on affordable AI chips threatens Nvidia\u2019s dominance. As these competitors gain market share, Nvidia\u2019s ability to maintain its pricing power and market stronghold may diminish, forcing it to adapt to a changing landscape.\n\nDeepSeek\u2019s advancements have ripple effects across the AI supply chain. If AI training costs continue to drop, tech giants may slow down their AI-related capital expenditures, impacting Nvidia\u2019s growth trajectory. Furthermore, the shift toward more cost-efficient AI solutions could reduce demand for Nvidia\u2019s high-end chips, altering market priorities from premium performance to affordability. This evolving landscape presents both risks and opportunities for Nvidia. While it may face increased competition, Nvidia\u2019s leadership in AI infrastructure and software solutions still gives it a competitive edge. However, it must adapt to changing market demands to sustain long-term growth.\n\nNvidia\u2019s market dominance is being challenged as the AI industry evolves. The rise of DeepSeek, along with increased competition from AMD, Broadcom, and major tech firms developing in-house chips, raises concerns about Nvidia\u2019s pricing power and long-term growth. Recent market shifts have already led to a $600 billion drop in Nvidia\u2019s market value, the largest single-day loss in U.S. stock history.\n\nIf the AI market prioritizes efficiency over expansion, Nvidia could see reduced demand for its high-end GPUs. However, its history of innovation, strong AI infrastructure, and ongoing R&D investments position it well to adapt. While some analysts view recent market dips as a buying opportunity, the competitive pressures and changing industry dynamics mean Nvidia must continue evolving to maintain its leadership in AI hardware.\n\n# TL;DR: Nvidia remains a dominant force in AI hardware, but emerging competitors like DeepSeek, AMD, and Broadcom are challenging its pricing power and market dominance. DeepSeek\u2019s AI model demonstrates that high-performance AI training can be achieved at significantly lower costs, potentially reshaping the AI ecosystem.

    "selftext": "Google [Tianyan-504](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=tianyan-504&t=newext&atb=v452-1&ia=web). Google [Zuchongzhi 3.0](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=tianyan-504&t=newext&atb=v452-1&ia=web). Google it, right now. Who\u2019s reporting this? China is right behind the USA in quantum computing research, and the markets don't seem to have a clue.\n\nTL;DR: Simply put, I believe the markets have not reacted to China\u2019s most recent advancements in quantum computing. China is potentially not as far behind the USA as markets would have you believe. I provide here a commentary of recent market movements, in relation to recent quantum computing news and developments. I follow with a more technical discussion of the significance of China\u2019s advancements, those of US corporations.\n\nFinancial disclaimer: While I justify my comments where possible, some of the comments I make in this post are pure speculation. I do not recommend making speculative trades, such as shorting quantum computing, or buying quantum cybersecurity. I am not a financial advisor, and this is not financial advice.\n\n  \nI was astounded to see the latest news dominating the headlines. How did the market not know that China was developing its own language-learning models? I\u2019m a filthy casual, and even I knew about it. It\u2019s been in our news at least [since July](https://www.marktechpost.com/2024/07/20/deepseek-v2-0628-released-an-improved-open-source-version-of-deepseek-v2/), and available for use [since September last year](https://api-docs.deepseek.com/news/news0905). It was pretty fucking good back then, too. And there\u2019s Alibaba\u2019s Qwenchat, Tencent\u2019s HunYuan, among numerous others they haven\u2019t even started talking about yet. What else have they forgotten, in this wild speculative bull run? They probably think the USA is lightyears ahead in quantum computing too. Oh, oh. They do, don't they?\n\nBefore you go any further, look up [Tianyan-504](https://english.cas.cn/newsroom/cas_media/202412/t20241206_893281.shtml). Look up [Zuchongzhi 3.0](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.11924). Google them, right now. They\u2019re right there, massive Chinese developments both announced in December 2024. Reportedly, the Tianyan-504 surpasses 500 qubits, on par with IBM\u2019s latest developments. And reportedly, Zuchongzhi 3.0 breaks Google\u2019s earlier Sycamore by all key metrics. Why can\u2019t we find any article produced by any reputable financial sources, that discuss the significance of these achievements? There is essentially zero market news about it. China is right behind the USA in quantum computing research, and the market has no fucking clue.\n\nI cannot share images on r/investing. You can refer to my profile for further analysis of specific stocks.\n\nCheck out D-Wave stock prices, for example. Given a large part of their business model relies in part on how they contribute to research in the field, they should be negatively impacted by major research developments in competing economies. Google\u2019s Willow breakthrough rallied quantum computing stocks and Nvidia\u2019s CEO pushed them back down. However, their stock prices did not move on 6/12 and 16/12 (corresponding with news releases of China's developments), suggesting that China\u2019s developments have had no impact.\n\nHow about Quantum Computing Inc (QUBT)? It tells a similar story. Their focus is on fabrication of photonic quantum computing components \u2013 and again, providing researchers access to quantum computing technology. It looks like Google\u2019s Willow breakthrough rallied stocks, and Nvidia\u2019s CEO pushed them back down. Again, China\u2019s developments have had zero impact.\n\nHow about IBM? News about Google\u2019s Willow pushed their price down some 3%, which makes good sense. Willow\u2019s performace blew that of IBM\u2019s September R2 Heron processor out of the water. Willow is a competitor, but IBM\u2019s position in the market means they are diversified in so much more than just quantum computing. A small bearish reaction makes perfect sense. So when Tianyan-504 reportedly challenged IBM's benchmarks just three days before Willow did, why didn\u2019t the stock price move?\n\nYou can look at SkyWater Technologies (SKYT), and at Global Foundries (GFS), and Rigetti (RGTI), Alphabet (GOOGL), Intel (INTC), TSM (TSM), Keysight Technologies (KEYS), and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). Every one of these key companies relevant to advancing quantum computing in the Western World have one thing in common. When China announces their developments, the markets appear to stay still.\n\nThere are three possible reasons for this that I have come up with. There may be other reasons as well that I am not aware of, in which case I encourage you to enlighten me.\n\nThe first possible reason is as above: The market is generally not aware. It is likely that some players in the market are aware, and this is a simple piece of information that such players will be taking advantage of \u2013 they do not have incentive to highlight this knowledge. Furthermore, the market may be uniquely slow to react. Unlike DeepSeek, which we can physically interact with, breaking records in quantum computing research is less tangible, less sensational. Breaking news, markets are irrational.\n\nThe second possible reason is simple: China may be lying. I can not find any evidence to support this idea, and China\u2019s past claims about quantum computing, such as those about [Jiuzhang](https://asiatimes.com/2023/10/china-unveils-faster-light-based-quantum-computer/), have been demonstrably true.\n\nThe third possible reason is that China\u2019s quantum computers are not as technically advanced as they sound. Originally I wanted to follow with a full technical discussion about the recent history of Chinese Quantum computing, and the merits of Tianyan-504 and Zuchongzhi 3.0 in comparison to western quantum computing efforts. But since I am not a subject matter expert, and I do not have the time to write in full depth. But I will provide a bit more technical information, summarise and provide references to the academic research for relevant breakthrough technologies, so you can read for yourself.\n\nChina is fighting to lead the global race in quantum computing, and [the Chinese government has been investing tens of billions of dollars into quantum computing research](https://thequantuminsider.com/2023/04/13/chinese-quantum-companies-and-national-strategy-2023/), alongside the investments of Chinese institutions and corporations.\n\nIn 2020 [Jiuzhang, developed at the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), was the second quantum computer in the world to achieve quantum supremacy](https://asiatimes.com/2023/10/china-unveils-faster-light-based-quantum-computer/), and the first photonic quantum computer to do so. Since then, the university has gone on to create further models of Jiuzhang, and develop chips with greater qubit lifetime and fidelity.\n\nIn April 2024, The Center for Excellence in Quantum Information and Quantum Physics developed their [Xiaohong superconducting chip](https://english.news.cn/20240425/a95b3c190a59486886f4cddc0def31cd/c.html), their most advanced to date, anticipated to reach the chip performance levels of main international cloud-enabled quantum computing platforms such as IBM\u2019s Heron in key performance metrics including qubit lifetime (how long a qubit can hold its quantum state) and readout fidelity (accuracy in extracting information from qubits). I note the market did not appear to react to the Xiaohong chip either.\n\nOn the 13^(th) of November 2024,[ IBM announced their Quantum Heron R2](https://www.ibm.com/quantum/blog/qdc-2024), achieving their goal of running quantum circuits with up to 5,000 two-qubit gates, demonstrating advancements in in qubit lifetime and readout fidelity.\n\nOn the 6^(th) of December 2024, [Tianyan-504 was announced](https://english.cas.cn/newsroom/cas_media/202412/t20241206_893281.shtml), developed by China Telecom Quantum Group (CTQG) in partnership with the Chinese Academy of Sciences and QuantumCTek Co., Ltd., and, built on the Xiaohong chips. China is now the only country to achieve quantum computational advantage through both photonics and superconducting quantum computing technologies. This quantum computer will be incorporated into their quantum computing cloud platform, and made available for researcher purposes.\n\nOn the 9^(th) of December, [Google\u2019s Willow was announced](https://blog.google/technology/research/google-willow-quantum-chip/). What makes Willow exceptional, is that it provides a breakthrough solution to quantum computing\u2019s fidelity issue. It exponentially reduces the amount of error while adding more qubits. Presumably Willow can now be scaled further, and I expect to see further developments with adding more qubits now that this challenge has been solved.\n\nTwo weeks later, on the 16^(th) of December 2024, an entirely separate research team with the China Telecom Quantum Group (CTQG) in partnership with the Chinese Academy of Sciences and QuantumCTek Co., Ltd. [announced their Zuchongzhi 3.0](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.11924v1#S1). This superconducting quantum computer makes numerous advancements, and demonstrates quantum advantage through speed. It crushes benchmarks set by Google\u2019s older Sycamore - \u201cCompared to Google\u2019s latest experiment, SYC-67 and SYC-70\u00a0 the classical simulation cost of our 83-qubit, 32-cycle experiment is six orders of magnitude higher.\u201d Though Zuchongzhi 3.0 does not demonstrate the error correction capability that Willow does, their creators have commented that they believe they can replicate the same techniques in a matter of months.\n\nQuantum computing is still twenty years away from being relevant, they say. That gives lots of time for China to catch up. And from what I can understand, China is just one breakthrough away. There are other questions, such as China\u2019s chip manufacturing capabilities, supply chains for components, that I am unable to find good information on. The US is doing what they can politically, through trade regulation, and restricting financial investment in China\u2019s technologies. China already has the [lead in quantum communications, and potentially in quantum sensing](https://itif.org/publications/2024/09/09/how-innovative-is-china-in-quantum/). But China holds one massive advantage: it\u2019s regime. In contrast to the American model, where corporations closely guard their own secrets from eachother, [China is claims they invest 15 billion of dollars into coordinated, cohesive research.](https://itif.org/publications/2024/09/09/how-innovative-is-china-in-quantum/) And it is showing in their results.\n\nEach advancement that China makes in developing its quantum computing capability, ought to remind the market that there is a risk that the lead the US enjoys in quantum computing is being threatened. But look at those google search results again. Outside of technical circles, the western media simply hasn't picked it up. Look at what happened with DeepSeek. I think the markets just don't know. Investors are already anxious about their investments in quantum computing, and are starting to demand returns. Manufacturers are reluctant to scale component production, given the low demand and potential for volatility. So when the market does find out about China\u2019s achievements in quantum computing, what's going to happen?\n\nLet me know what you think.",

    "title": "TSMC: The Backbone of Global AI Chipmaking",
    "selftext": "Summary:\n\n* **Global Leadership in AI Chips:** TSMC dominates the semiconductor market, producing over 90% of the globe\u2019s most advanced chips, crucial for AI and HPC applications.\n* **Geopolitical Risks:** Taiwan\u2019s political tensions with China and U.S. export restrictions could affect TSMC, but its Arizona expansion helps mitigate risks.\n* **Strong Market Position:** Partnerships with Nvidia, Apple, and AMD highlight TSMC\u2019s technological edge, particularly with 3nm and 5nm nodes.\n* **Investment Potential:** Despite challenges, TSMC's 2025 focus on AI growth, HPC revenue, and strategic diversification underscores its value as a long-term investment.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) is the global leader in advanced chip manufacturing, powering the AI revolution with its cutting-edge technology. As the primary supplier for tech giants like Nvidia, Apple, and AMD, TSMC produces over 90% of the world\u2019s most advanced semiconductors, which are essential across industries, from military systems to consumer electronics. The company\u2019s dominance is driven by its consistent investment in leading-edge processes, including 3nm and 5nm nodes, which form the backbone of high-performance computing and AI applications.\n\nHowever, TSMC faces significant geopolitical risks due to its concentration in Taiwan, a region under constant tension with China, which views Taiwan as a breakaway province. A disruption in TSMC\u2019s operations could spark a global semiconductor crisis, impacting economies worldwide. To mitigate these risks, TSMC has been diversifying its production capabilities, with a notable $40 billion investment in its Arizona facility. This expansion strengthens supply chain resilience and ensures U.S. access to cutting-edge chips for AI, defense, and other critical technologies. Additionally, the U.S. CHIPs Act offsets the high operational costs of U.S.-based facilities and supports workforce development.\n\nTSMC\u2019s position as the backbone of the AI and HPC sectors is underscored by its strategic collaboration with Nvidia to produce advanced AI chips, such as the Blackwell series, further cementing its role as a critical supplier in this rapidly growing market. In Q3 2024, TSMC\u2019s revenue grew by 36% year-over-year, driven by strong AI-related demand, and it projects that mid-50% of its total revenue will come from HPC applications in 2025.\n\nDespite its strengths, TSMC must navigate industry challenges, including the cyclical nature of the semiconductor market, declining PC and smartphone demand, and Wall Street's caution over potential growth slowdowns. Innovations in AI-driven consumer technologies and CES product launches could help revitalize these segments, with TSMC\u2019s advanced chipmaking capabilities playing a central role.\n\nFrom a valuation perspective, TSMC\u2019s forward P/E ratio of 22.81 and PEG ratio of 0.73 suggest that while the stock trades at a premium, it remains reasonable given the company\u2019s earnings growth and leadership in the AI sector. Geopolitical risks, while significant, are partially mitigated by the company\u2019s diversification and reduced reliance on China, which now accounts for only 10% of its revenue.\n\nTSMC has outperformed the semiconductor market benchmark (SMH) due to its advanced technology and strategic partnerships, recovering more quickly from market selloffs and demonstrating strong resilience. The company\u2019s ability to balance geopolitical risks, invest in cutting-edge technologies, and sustain high demand for its products positions it as an attractive long-term investment.\n\nIn conclusion, TSMC\u2019s leadership in semiconductor innovation and its critical role in AI chipmaking make it indispensable to the global technology industry. While challenges remain, its proactive approach to diversification and its focus on high-growth sectors like AI and HPC ensure its continued success and solidify its appeal as an investment in 2025.\n\nTLDR: TSMC is a global leader in semiconductor manufacturing, pivotal for AI chipmaking with unmatched technological dominance. While geopolitical risks and U.S.-China tensions pose challenges, the company\u2019s strategic expansions, such as its Arizona facilities, and its robust growth in AI-driven markets make it a compelling investment in 2025.\n\n",

    "selftext": "Jensen Huang, Nvidia CEO delivered the CES (Consumer Electronic Show) keynote on January 6th, 2025. An immensely popular event, with about 140,000 attendees, the charismatic Jensen drew a packed crowd. Jensen did not disappoint.\n\n# There were three big announcements\n\n# New Gaming Cards\n\nNvidia\u2019s new line of\u00a0RTX 50 Series gaming graphics cards is based on the company\u2019s Blackwell chip architecture. Considering the massive leap Blackwell has made over Hopper, its previous iteration in data center applications, getting it to work in gaming is a huge deal \u2013 a massive improvement with superior rendering and higher frame rates for gamers.\n\n# Digits\n\nThe Linux-based desktop computer with the GB 10 Grace Blackwell Superchip with a CPU and GPU. A first in its history at $3,000 \u201cPlacing an AI supercomputer on the desks of every data scientist, AI researcher, and student empowers them to engage and shape the age of AI,\u201d Huang said.\n\nIt may seem like a niche product for high-end engineers/professors/scientists and researchers, but I think it\u2019s a deliberate and excellent strategy to evangelize the product, through the folks who can develop use cases and apps that can further the market for cheaper at scale mass Digits in the future.\n\nThis is straight from the Nvidia playbook from the last two decades \u2013 they have always involved the scientific and research community from the start. I can bet a large number of these are going to be distributed free to campuses.\n\nI think Digits will turn out to be a very consequential product for Nvidia \u2013 with several billion in revenue in a few years. But forecasts aside, what\u2019s key is that Digits uses a scaled-down version of Nvidia\u2019s Grace AI server CPU technology. It\u2019s packaged in a Mac Mini-sized form factor with the help of Taiwan-based\u00a0**MediaTek**, which Huang commended for its expertise in building low-power chips.\n\nQuoting Tae Kim from Barron\u2019s who authored an excellent book on Nvidia\n\n>Over time, the logical move for Nvidia would be to scale down this CPU further for consumer Windows laptops. By integrating its graphics expertise, MediaTek\u2019s power-saving capabilities, and the efficiency of Arm-based CPU technology, Nvidia could create a processor that offers leading graphics for gaming and high performance for productivity, along with long battery life. While prior Arm-based Windows PCs have struggled with software compatibility, Nvidia\u2019s top-notch software engineering could make it work.\n\nHuang strongly hinted that the introduction of Digits was a precursor to the PC market, even as there are questions about why Nvidia chose Linux over Windows \u2013 and we should hear more about that at their GTC conference in March.\n\nIt could shake up the moribund PC market, which has been suffering from a lack of growth rates after COVID-19. Desktop PCs and laptop computers still generate large revenues for\u00a0**Intel**\u00a0and\u00a0**Advanced Micro Devices**, the primary makers of x86-based processors \u2013 a legacy that could give way to ARM-based processors, which Apple uses. Analysts expect Intel to generate $30 billion in revenue from its client computing business in 2024, according to FactSet, while AMD has $6.7 billion in revenue in its client segment.\n\nBillions of potential new revenue are at stake for Nvidia, which is forecasted to make about $180Bn in sales in the 12 months ending January 2026. While data center takes up the largest share of revenue at about $150Bn of that pie and gaming, auto, and professional visualization (Omniverse) take the rest, a new source would help a great deal when data center revenue growth slows down.\n\nIn the past two years, Nvidia has monopolized the AI data center market with the best-designed, highest-performing chips. Nvidia would likely make a significant dent in the PC market as well as the new paradigm in edge computing with all the computing power and constant innovation and upgrades at its disposal.\n\n# Cosmos\n\nThe third announcement was for COSMOS \u2013 a significant improvement over their Omniverse and the biggest catalyst/enabler of \u201cPhysical AI\u201d, I\u2019ll write a separate note on that.\n\n**Nvidia is firing on all cylinders and that\u2019s great news for consumers.**",

    "selftext": "As a newer investor coming from the ETF side of things, a \"value\" approach has been my first way of learning to look at companies. I'm thinking more about their story, how they make money, whether they do it consistently, P/E ratio, EV/EBITDA, low debt, etc. \n\nI lurk around on r/ValueInvesting and have gotten some good book recommendations, although I mostly use them for reference rather than reading them in their entirety. \n\nThe S&P 500 was at a P/E ratio of over 100 in 2008 when the market crashed, although there have been pullbacks and recessions with lower P/Es than at current levels. All that to say, maybe the market is overvalued by traditional valuation metrics. I guess I'm trying to understand why many users and even successful YouTubers like Joseph Carlson and others recommend many high P/E companies. I gather that these companies have a sustainable competitive advantage with a lot of growth priced in. I'm talking about companies like SPGI, ASML, GOOGL (this actually seems like a growth company with decent valuations), UBER, ARM, NVDA, AVGO, META, FTNT, AMD, etc.\n\nThese companies seem to have a good moat, great CEO's, strong balance sheets but a lot of growth priced in. Frankly, it seems like one could do quite well with companies like these. I've underperformed significantly (thankfully with small positions for the purposes of gaining experience) picking stocks with what I thought were traditional value metrics, companies like HDSN, JILL, ALB, CP, VIRC, etc. Granted, I don't really feel like I have a circle of competence and didn't look too much into how these companies make money. I'll admit that I was riding mostly on the convictions of others, which I recognize is a major issue in itself that I intend to correct going forward. \n\nSo for those of you who invest in individual companies and have had success, here are some questions;\n\n1) Is it productive to differentiate between growth and value companies?\n\n2) Is it fruitful to look for companies with a 10-15 P/E ratio and other \"deep value\" metrics or is traditional value investing dead altogether due to modern age computing power?\n\n3) Does the rise in popularity of index investing exacerbate irrationality in markets to the point where valuations don't matter?\n\nAny insights are greatly appreciated.

NVIDIA and Amazon took dips and it seems like the right time to capitalize considering I want a long term approach. However, with many rumours that this high market has to take a downturn at some point is it too risky to bank on today's lows for the long term. At this point of the low point I could buy AMD, Amazon, NVIDIA (maybe), Microsoft, and Visa. Would you recommend buying today's dip or bank on a continuing dip, remember this is primarily for longterm. What are you guys thinking and what is your thought process for all of this?

    "title": "Nvidia: Expect Valuation To Soar Higher On 2025's AI Spending Increases",
    "selftext": "# Summary\n\n* Nvidia\u2019s 2024 revenue surged by 86% to $113.3 billion, with operating income doubling to $71 billion.\n* Hyperscalers are expected to increase AI-focused capital expenditures by 50% in 2025, reaching $300 billion.\n* Nvidia\u2019s next-generation Blackwell architecture offers up to 15x performance improvements, securing its 90% market dominance in AI GPUs.\n* Competitors like AMD and Broadcom struggle with ecosystem integration and software optimization, solidifying Nvidia\u2019s lead.\n* Analysts project a 50x earnings multiple and a target price of $225 per share for 2025.\n\nNvidia Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA) enjoyed unprecedented financial success in 2024, driven by a wave of hyperscaler investments in data center infrastructure for artificial intelligence. Revenues soared by 86%, reaching $113.3 billion, while operating income more than doubled to $71 billion, signaling the company\u2019s dominance in the AI sector.\n\nDespite such robust growth, concerns over a potential slowdown are misplaced. The global push toward AI and machine learning shows no signs of waning. Leading technology giants like Amazon Web Services, Microsoft, Meta Platforms, and Google are significantly expanding their high-performance computing capabilities to meet the surging demand for generative AI, large language models, and advanced AI applications.\n\nIn 2024, hyperscaler capital expenditures on data centers totaled approximately $200 billion. For 2025, this figure is projected to rise by 50%, hitting $300 billion. According to Morgan Stanley, Amazon and Microsoft are set to lead this spending spree with investments of $96.4 billion and $89.9 billion, respectively. Google and Meta will closely follow, allocating $62.6 billion and $52.3 billion to their AI-driven infrastructure.\n\nThis aggressive investment is underpinned by statements from top executives. Google\u2019s CFO noted that while growth in capital expenditures won\u2019t match the leap between 2023 and 2024, further increases are expected. Similarly, Meta\u2019s CEO Mark Zuckerberg highlighted plans for significant growth in infrastructure spending. Microsoft, too, has committed $80 billion for AI-oriented data center construction in fiscal 2025.\n\nNvidia, with its 90% share of the AI GPU market, is perfectly positioned to capitalize on this surge in spending. The release of its next-generation Blackwell architecture in early 2025 promises substantial performance gains, including up to 2.5 times the training performance of its Hopper GPUs and as much as 15 times higher inference capabilities in select benchmarks. These advancements, paired with Nvidia\u2019s proprietary CUDA platform, reinforce its unassailable ecosystem of hardware and software solutions.\n\nCompetitors like AMD and Broadcom continue to face hurdles. AMD\u2019s MI300X GPUs, while promising on paper, have failed to deliver comparable performance due to software deficiencies. Broadcom\u2019s custom silicon projects, although intriguing, lack the versatility and support ecosystem Nvidia GPUs provide. Consequently, neither competitor poses a significant threat in the near term, with meaningful competition unlikely before 2026 or 2027.\n\n# TL;DR\n\nNvidia\u2019s remarkable 2024 growth, fueled by hyperscaler investments, will continue as AI spending surges 50% in 2025 to $300 billion. With its dominant 90% GPU market share and groundbreaking Blackwell architecture, Nvidia is well-positioned for further success.\u00a0\n\n*Price at Publication:* **$144.12**",

    "selftext": "I'm an early 30s single guy with a solid income. I invest $1885.00 every week which amounts to roughly half of my take home pay, and I live off the other half.\n\nI live in a very high cost of living city and I rent an apartment. I've got a very long time horizon so I'm trying to be aggressive.\n\nHere is how I divvy my money:\n\nStock | Amount Invested | Percentage of investment\n:--|:--:|--:\nS&P 500 ETF (VOO) | $700 | 37.14%\nNASDAQ 100 ETF (QQQM) | $400 | 21.22%\nMAG 6 (no Tesla) | $180 ($30 each) | 9.55%\nSmall Caps (AVUV) | $120 | 6.37%\nBitcoin ETF (IBIT) | $100 | 5.30%\nFinancial Sector ETFs (XLF and IAI) * | $80 ($40 each) | 4.244%\nSemiconductors ETF (SMH) | $80 | 4.244%\nIndividual Stock Picks I like (15 in total, listed below) ** | $225 ($15 each) | 11.94%\n**TOTAL** | $1885 | 100%\n\n*The difference between XLF and IAI is that XLF is mostly financial services such as JP Morgan Visa, Mastercard, Bank of America, Wells Fargo etc..., whereas IAI is mostly brokers and securities dealers such as Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Schwab, S&P Global etc... There is only a 15% overlap between these two ETFs.\n\n**The 15 companies I like that I invest $15 each into are: Adobe (ADBE), AMD (AMD), Broadcom (AVGO), Chipotle (CMG), Salesforce (CRM), Door Dash (DASH), Netflix (NFLX), ServiceNow (NOW), Palo Alto Networks (PANW), Palantir (PLTR), Shopify (SHOP), Sofi Bank (SOFI), Uber (UBER)\n\n---\n\nI think at first glance, some will say that there is a little redundancy here, such as investing in the MAG 6 companies individually while also investing the majority of my money in VOO and QQQ which both contain the Mag 6 as their largest holdings each. This is a fair criticism, although I do this intentionally because I want more of a slant towards these companies so I get higher exposure by also investing in them individually, in addition to the exposure I get from the index funds.\n\nI'm open to feedback from others. I'm trying to be aggressive in this portfolio which is why I invest in the Mag 6 and the 15 companies I like, while also trying to have some degree of diversification by putting 58.36% of my money in the S&P and Nasdaq, getting small cap exposure, exposure to the financial sector so that I am not exclusively in tech, and including bitcoin which is an entirely different asset class than equities (even though technically this is a stock that tracks the price of bitcoin, it is 100% linked to bitcoin).\n\nPlease provide any thoughts or constructive criticism below.

This approach is considered risky, but I have strong conviction in their relative valuation, defensibility, and long-term prospects.\n\nIn this case I believe that 'diversification' among AI stocks would do more to dilute my returns than mitigate my risks. Particularly because they're all highly correlated and despite its market cap, Nvidia has the most reasonable valuation all things considered. We'll see if the bet pays off.\n\nTo clarify, I am confident in the long-term prospects of Palantir, Tesla, and others, but I'm just not comfortable with the valuations.

The difference is that new technology like AI can now spread faster than ever before and get used in new ways. Every new epoch uniquely benefits from the past, potentially bending the growth curve in new ways.\n\n>The other difference is that Nvidia has a monopoly position on the core technology driving this innovation. Therefore, the \\~350% run up over the last 12 months doesn\u2019t make NVIDIA the stock of the last year, but rather it\u2019s the stock of the next decade. The recent 3X gain will be a blip compared to what\u2019s coming thanks to NVIDIA\u2019s CUDA (moat), among\u00a0[other things](https://stratechery.com/2023/nvidia-on-the-mountaintop/).\u201d\n\n>\\- [1.5 year follow-up on buying the dip on pandemic stocks](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/17mzc07/15_year_followup_on_buying_the_dip_on_pandemic/), Nov. 2023\n\n# Nvidia's dominance\n\nI'm still working through my thoughts here, but my strong conviction around Nvidia comes in part from these observations:\n\n* Nvidia is\u00a0[founder-led](https://www.amazon.com/Nvidia-Way-Jensen-Huang-Making/dp/1324086718/)\u00a0and focuses on accelerated computing while remaining broad enough to allow for innovation and insight across industries where it can apply its core competencies.\n* It's unprecedented to have such dominance in such a fast-growing, valuable industry while maintaining such a long-term sustainable advantage.\n* This advantage is due to unreasonable investments (research, hardware, software, ecosystem, relationships) over decades, making it hard to copy.\n* AI will consistently make software\u00a0easier to create, thus reducing the moats of software companies and make them less attractive than hardware companies (for now).\n* Despite their impressive growth, Nvidia is still supply constrained, which is fundamentally easier to predict than demand constraints.\n\n# We still underestimate the AI opportunity\n\nMost importantly, we\u2019ve barely scratched the surface of AI\u2019s opportunities and benefits. Even the most ambitious targets underestimate it because the better and cheaper AI gets, the more use cases we'll find.\n\nWe have a habit of confusing the limits of our imagination with the limits of reality. Our imaginations are trained on what happened before, but there has never been anything like this before.\n\n# Final thoughts\n\nI'm still well within the '*maybe I'm just lucky*' phase since it's only been a couple years. Towards the end of [my last update](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1d758m7/2_year_followup_on_buying_the_dip_on_pandemic/)\u00a0I also shared a few ways my investment approach has changed, which I\u2019m still benefiting from.\n\nI expect my next update to be the 3-year update in mid 2025.\n\n**UPDATE:** Thanks for mentioning I should have included indexes for benchmark context. Indexes like QQQ and S&P 500 also had good returns during the same period (June 2022 - Dec 2024). For an apples to apples comparison, the IRR of QQQ and S&P 500 respectively during this period were \\~24% and \\~16%.",

My half baked technical analysis is. We will see a minor pull back around $50 to finish the pattern, then it will launch back up to the next critical level around $60 a share. \n\nFundamentally speaking, they have been showing plenty of growth and demand for their products which mainly consists of hardware to House semiconductors, especially their trademark marked water cooled rack, which directly addresses a huge issue that centers are facing as computing power gets to Skynet levels. Their price to earnings ratio is a modest 21.9, the earnings per share is a humble 2, the ps ratio is 1.5 which is the lowest among its competitors. In fact all of its metrics or lowest amongst its competitors except for the EPS for AMD, which is 1.1. \n\nThere will be much to see within the next quarterly earnings report and how they managed to address their auditing issues and reporting issues. But I think this company still has room to run and definitely has legs.\n\nI have 200 shares with plans to buy much more. I was going to buy on the next red day, expecting it to be Monday, but I digress. Next pull back I\u2019m buying calls with a strike price of about $49-$55 exp in March. Even considering a YOLO.

    "selftext": "My dad is an active investor, has been for decades and we talk about stocks and companies around the holidays. Yesterday we were talking about Nvidia and in our conversation there was something about AI and Nvidia and that he didn't know that I thought was common knowledge, but I'm curious how common it actually is or if it's a generational gap.\n\nThe knowledge that I thought was common was that the biggest reason Nvidia is well positioned to benefit from spending on AI is that graphics algorithms (e.g. video games, CGI rendering, etc.) and machine learning algorithms rely on the same kind of computation, large matrix multiplication. They have spent decades developing GPUs for graphics processing + other stuff, but through no effort on their own, the \"other stuff\" is now more valuable than the graphics processing. Their \"AI hardware\" is really just the most recent version of their GPUs that they sold to consumers, to Pixar, etc. not similar, they are \\*literally\\* the same thing.\n\nThey didn't somehow develop AI hardware in the past 2 years that's better than everybody else's, they've been developing the product for decades for another purpose and stumbled into the AI use case. This is also why it's so hard for a competitor to overtake them, they have a lot of ground to catch up on. Hardware development is really slow, really expensive and really difficult.\n\nThis came up in the context of my dad telling me some rumor he had heard about an ex-Nvidia current-Tesla engineer saying something about how Tesla had hardware that was years ahead of Nvidia, which is not really even remotely likely IMHO. Google has spent almost 10 years developing its TPUs for machine learning specifically and even then they're only faster in some narrow scenarios and is way more restrictive computationally.\n\nAs to why Nvidia and not AMD, it's largely because of their software stack and community support. They have put a lot of effort into developing CUDA, cuDNN, etc. and putting it in the hands of researchers starting 10+ years ago, so now it's what everybody builds on.\n\nBefore all the arm-chair experts come out of the woodwork, yes I know that GPUs are general purpose parallel processing units, but the point is that they have long been designed with graphics in mind first and foremost. And I know that they've been tailoring recent generations of GPUs more towards ML use-cases (e.g. tensor-cores) and they're not exactly like GPUs of old. And yes I know that their data-center business has long been a big portion of their revenue and they make more than just consumer graphics cards.\n\nI don't mean to discount their good work, they've done a great job in positioning themselves in the best way possible, there is a lot to be said about being able to capitalize on good luck.\n\n  \ntl,dr; the energy it takes to train ChatGPT could fry 100,000 turkeys this year (I didn't check the math)",

I have played with stocks in the past on Questrade and have basically only come out slightly positive because of investments in Apple and AMD. I was suggested a financial advisor and started talking with one at IG Wealth Management.\n\nLong story short: I'm getting cold feet at pulling the trigger with them. The portfolio they are suggesting is the iProfile Portfolio Global Equity Series F managed by Philip Petursson. Based on my aggressive investing stance, I'd be paying a 2.37% fee (MER of 1.01%). However this portfolio has nice returns after accounting for the fee (8.11 for 3YR, 28.01 for 1YR, 18.38 YTD).\n\nBut doing some quick maths it looks like the fees would cost me $300K over 25 years in fees (if I'm investing 10-12k a year). This does not account for a waived or decreased fee once you hit $250k, which would be around year 11 for me.\n\nWhen I asked about these numbers they said that These funds are actively managed and you're paying for the available advice, as well as dampening losses in bad years, and overall a better return in the long run compared to index funds. They also said an expected growth per year is 7%.\n\nI was also cautioned that ETFs have hidden fees that are not shown upfront...which from what I have read, is not true.\n\nI know these advisors are salesmen that want to gain more clients. But I'm also aware that anyone can post their financial advice on reddit and act like it is the gospel while having no credentials to back it up.\n\nSo my question is: What are people's experiences with IG vs ETFs and self investing? Would people be willing to share their experiences with either ETFs or IG and give numerical examples to back up their stance?\n\nThanks!",

Just two years ago, Intel's DCAI group earned $5 billion - $6 billion per quarter. But as AMD's EPYC processors have gained competitive advantages over Intel's Xeon CPUs, Intel has had to sell its server chips at significant discounts, which has reduced the company's revenue and profit margins.\n> \n> It is noteworthy that Intel's flagship 128-core Xeon 6980P 'Granite Rapids' processor costs $17,800, making it the company's most expensive standard CPU ever. By contrast, AMD's most expensive 96-core EPYC 6979P processor costs $11,805. If demand for Intel's Xeon 6900-series processors remains high and the company can supply these CPUs in decent volumes, then Intel's datacenter revenue will likely get back on track and surpass AMD's datacenter sales. However, Intel still has to ramp up production of its Granite Rapids products. ",

    "selftext": "hey all, sharing what i'm calling my \"frontier tech\" portfolio, broken down by percentages. i'm looking for valuable input, feedback, and discussion around it. and, if it happens to be helpful to anyone, even better. i do want to clarify a few things:\n\n* i'm focused on AI, bitcoin, and space. investment vehicles or not, i simply think each are tech frontiers that hold tons of promise, are poised for massive growth, and will bring immense amounts of value to the world over the next few decades. let's just call this a \"frontier tech\" portfolio, to give it a name i can reference.\n* i'm not looking for feedback that just disagrees with that thesis. whether you think AI is all hype, or you are anti-Bitcoin and think it's a ponzi scheme, or you think space is a waste of resources, or anything along these lines - that's ok, i respect that perspective, but i'd like to avoid arguing about it. we just disagree about some fundamental things, and you won't convince me i'm simply wrong.\n* i AM looking for feedback on blind spots, poor/missing assumptions, overconfidence, things i'm not considering, or any other constructive input that falls within the framework of the overall thesis. i'm not just looking for people to agree with me (though that is interesting input as well) - i just want feedback that can be applied within my overall investing philosophy.\n* yes, i'm missing some key areas of what many would call \"frontier tech\" - biotech, green / nuclear energy, cybersecurity, to name a few - but i just don't have the same level of confidence in specific areas of those. i prefer to stay relatively focused on the categories where i'm most confident and able to stay up to date.\n* i'm trying to keep my language somewhat appealing to a wide audience. not looking to get too bogged down in technical details or language that would alienate someone reading this stuff who's less familiar with one or any of the spaces/categories.\n* my primary goal is a portfolio of funds and stocks that i can invest in with *strong long-term confidence in growth.* not stuff i trade frequently. and not stuff i love the idea of or that seems interesting / sexy but that i don't know enough about (SMCI, PLTR, altcoins as some good examples). i also generally prefer companies whose leadership i trust and/or admire.\n\nok, with that out of the way, let's dive in:\n\n**30% AI** - 10% NVDA, 5% SOXQ, 15% balanced mixed of NOW, MSFT, AAPL, GOOGL, META, AMZN\n\n* HIGH LEVEL: to me, this category is ABSOLUTELY going to change our world in fundamental ways over the next several decades. AI's potential is not chatGPT, or smarter versions of it. it's far beyond what we're seeing from LLMs today. if you listen to the engineers and operational leaders within the AI space, listen to not what they \"believe\" is gonna happen, but to what they know is coming because they've already used the tech, usually 1-2 years before the public even sees it, these people are overwhelmed, amazed, terrified, enchanted, bewildered. to me, that's just very interesting. i believe what some others do - that we're in the midst or on the verge of another technological revolution. i'm not bothered much that AI isn't monetizing in demonstrable, repeatable ways. i think there's been and continues to be enough fundamental, increasing advancement in this field that the value creation will absolutely surpass what most people think. as for the individual stocks, i'll do a quick dive here. to be clear, I don't think these are groundbreaking choices and many are very obvious. but, seems useful to give my favorite things about each:\n* 10% NVDA - these guys are and will continue to be at the center of the whole thing. their moat is extensive. it's not just GPU / blackwell demand. it's their CUDA programming language and universe, and stickiness of it. it's the long-term horizon required for their data centers that makes 5-10 year customers out of everyone who buys their stuff. it's CEO jensen pushing them and already looking for the \"next big thing.\" just a lot of confidence here.\n* 5% SOXQ - i like this semiconductor ETF a little more than SMH because it's more diverse (SMH is like 25% NVDA, which is great if i didn't already allocate so much there), and it's got a low expense ratio (0.19%). i love this exposure because the AI industry is driven by these companies (e.g. TSMC, Micron, Broadcam, Qualcomm, AMD, AMAT).\n* 15% mix of these...\n   * NOW - excellent leadership and integrated heavily with NVDA tech; will benefit hugely from AI boom with AI-driven automation\n   * META - founder-run and with a clear vision; demonstrating enormous resources and focus on building AI models, meeting consumer needs, being pioneers in tech at large\n   * AAPL - will probably benefit the most from consumer-facing AI products and implementation; strong leadership\n   * AMZN - AWS is a profit monster that will be huge for AI tools and services and data centers; logistics and ecom will be big AI beneficiaries; strong leadership\n   * MSFT - deeply embedded in the AI revolution with its investment in OpenAI + AI integration into Azure and Microsoft 365; excellent leadership\n   * GOOGL - AI pioneer with DeepMind / Brain; they still own search; have enormous amount of data; questionable leadership but I'm holding for now\n* No TSLA??? no. i just don't trust elon musk enough at this point. and i need confidence in a company's leadership for me to invest in its stock. there's a big chance i'm missing out (their robotics division might be incredible), but I'm able to sleep OK with that.\n* i'm also missing plenty of other AI picks. i know that. these are the ones i can invest in with the most confidence.\n\n**30% Bitcoin** - 25% Bitcoin itself (cold storage or an ETF), 5% MSTR\n\n* HIGH LEVEL: why Bitcoin? books have been written about it, but to shortly summarize my perspective - it's quite volatile and risky short-term, and quite growth-oriented and (thus far) safe long-term. excellent store of value. wonderful technology, math/code based, and may or may not upend some portion of the financial system. limited supply that's only decreasing over time. immutable. now adopted by many big institutions. goes on giant bull runs every 4 or so years. some days, it's hard to justify NOT putting more into this one, but for now i'm convinced that\u00a0 diversification is the better long-term play.\n* 20% Bitcoin - many would argue that holding actual Bitcoin, ideally off exchanges and on cold storage is the smartest play here. but there are also arguments for FBTC or IBIT (helpful in tax-advantaged accounts; trusting an ETF seems safer to some - very debatable). i do some cold storage, and some FBTC (they self-custody their Bitcoin, which not everyone does). either way, just Bitcoin. it's the only crypto play where my confidence level is very high.\n* 5% MSTR - this is a leveraged Bitcoin play. strong chance it outpaces BTC growth rate during bull runs. i may shift some MSTR profits to Bitcoin over time if it starts to really offset my 4:1 BTC:MSTR ratio.\n\n**30% Space** - 10% ASTS, 10% RKLB, 5% LUNR\n\n* HIGH LEVEL: the tech for space finally seems to match the potential that's been talked about for decades and decades. for a while, space-x really proved this out, almost single-handedly. but we clearly have some strong other players either in or entering the category. my favorites are these three. here's why:\n* 10% ASTS - you should read the kook report (google it) for a true deep dive, but to hit my high level points: they are pre-revenue but with the potential for MASSIVE growth. effectively, their satellite system aims to offer a global cellular network. think starlink but more b2b and generally better tech. they own tons of patents. they are 5+ years ahead of what many think will be a winner-takes-most race. their partners already include AT&T, Verizon, Vodafone, Rakuten, American Tower, Bell Canada, and more. they have excellent leadership. i find this a risky-ish play as they have tons to still accomplish, but the potential growth is enormous.\n* 10% RKLB - effectively, a space-x competitor on smaller rockets, with a fraction of the market cap and a huge runway for growth. i think still heavily undervalued today. nerdy/awesome leadership. vertically integrated. as telecom, defense, and general research spending expands to space economy, RKLB is positioned very, very well.\n* 5% LUNR - i've spent less time researching them than the other two, but my confidence level in the risk/reward is still pretty high. key player in the lunar economy - one of few companies that can deliver payloads to the moon. very niche but valuable moat. huge potential, good amount of risks ahead.\n\n**10% cash** - ...to buy them juicy dips.\n\nok, that's my \"frontier tech\" portfolio summary. to repeat - this is what i can confidently invest in for what i believe will be better-than-average returns over the next 10+ years. i recognize that this discussion didn't even really touch share price, EPS, P/E, profitability, revenue, or other key details. this just isn't the place where i'm getting into that. i can say that i'm comfortable with the financial metrics and details regarding these companies. but this discussion is mainly focused on what categories i think are poised for the most growth, and what companies/stocks/assets in those categories seem to be most positioned to lead that growth. thanks for reading.\n\n*\\*\\*\\*The information provided is for educational and informational purposes only and should not be considered financial advice.

    "selftext": "So I've had a financial advisor for a while now, and I completely forgot about the account because since acquiring this advisor however many years ago, I've started doing my own investing now. I have a Roth IRA with fidelity that is managed by fidelity (under 25k has no fees, and above 25k is .35%.) Most of my money is in my brokerage account in things like Nvidia, AMD, and VOO. I also have growth stocks like RIVN that make up a much smaller percentage of my portfolio. My point is now that I've seen my own gains, and the Fidelity roth IRA is so cheap comparatively, is there even a reason to stick with a financial advisor? I have $2,500 with this guy (for comparison, I have 15k between my Roth / Brokerage / HYSA in fidelity) and frankly is there any reason I shouldn't just take that money and put it in my Roth? or brokerage account in VOO? I'm realizing that a financial advisor might be for the people that know literally nothing about investing and panic sell and buy / don't invest at all because they don't understand how investing works at all. I know the raw cost basis of having the advisor is more expensive, I'm not asking about the fees, but more so the gains that are possible personally, vs with an advisor.",

    "title": "Nvidia\u2019s massive stock buyback",
    "selftext": "From MarketWatch. \n\nhttps://www.marketwatch.com/story/nvidias-stock-buyback-plan-is-one-of-the-biggest-of-2024-is-that-a-good-thing-9beba5c5?mod=djem_mwnafterbell\n\n> The semiconductor company announced alongside its earnings on Wednesday that it has boosted its stock buyback authorization by $50 billion. That\u2019s double the size of the $25 billion share-repurchase program announced a year ago\n\n> Looking beyond the year, Nvidia\u2019s announcement is tied for the 12th-largest [stock buyback] on record. The company is one of only seven in the U.S. to have announced a buyback program of $50 billion or more. The buyback authorization is 1.7% the size of Nvidia\u2019s market capitalization, which is about $2.91 trillion.\n\nI tend to like stock buybacks. I like them more than dividends. The company has enough faith in itself that it wants to secure more of its own profits.  If you\u2019re spiraling down in the dumpster, there\u2019s really no need to buy back\u2014 especially if you believe this is the High Point and it\u2019s only going down from here.\n\nNvidia has a number of problems. One is that it has a gigantic amount of cash. It was estimated that within three years it might be able to turn out 270 billion in free cash flow\n\nBut as the big player in the market, both its own specific market and the broader market, it\u2019s gonna have a real tough time making big deals. Meaning deals significant enough to affect the bottom line.\n\nIt\u2019s in the old-school Microsoft phase where everything it does is gonna be examined for antitrust. Can you imagine if they tried to buy AMD or something like that? It\u2019s never gonna happen even if it made sense and didn\u2019t destroy competition. \n\nSo they\u2019ve got infinite money and kind of very finite things to do with it. their purchases of other companies has been around 300 *million* this year. Which is entirely insignificant.\n\nHowever, I worry that the stock is insanely expensive. It\u2019s noted that this gives them the option to pull the trigger whenever they want. So if there is a downturn, that\u2019s good news for them because they\u2019ll be able to spend triple digit billions buying themselves back.\n\nSo in one sense, you can look at this as potentially bad news. Meaning they expect enough volatility, including down swings, to make it possible and profitable to have the 12th largest buyback in history.  \n\nOR they feel they aren\u2019t gonna drop and this is just a low point of a forever-climbing stock price.\n\nEither way it\u2019s good for Nvidia, but it makes it tough for investors to predict. If this was anyone else, I think it would be a little bit easier, but there\u2019s so much money and the scale is so vast that it\u2019s hard to wrap my head around. \n\nIf they had been able to buy the dip a month or so ago, it\u2019s astounding how much money they would\u2019ve made. Not to mention securing more of their future profits.\n\nObviously, companies of this size don\u2019t move that fast and they aren\u2019t playing a shell game. So it\u2019s merely just a thought experiment to see how much money they would\u2019ve created out of a blip.\n\nLots of companies do buybacks, and lots of high-tech companies do buybacks. And the timing of it can generally illuminate a lot of things. But in this instance, I\u2019m having a tough time seeing through it. \n\nIn the past, they haven\u2019t been a really savvy financial company. They\u2019re not doing all kinds of tricks and schemes and mergers and things to burn short sellers and whatever. They\u2019ve just been \u201cboring\u201d R&D and managed to get ahead of at least three or four massive shifts in technology in the world economy. \n\nThe stock split. I had kind of considered it surprising. It just didn\u2019t fit who they\u2019ve been up to this point. Why does it matter if they\u2019re 3000 or 100? I suppose it\u2019s nice that more of the unwashed can get in on the purchase. But it seems to be a small distinction. Like how many people could afford a few hundred bucks but not a few thousand bucks? AND are buy and hold stock investors. I said at the time it wasn\u2019t gonna move the needle whatsoever. But beyond that, I just don\u2019t really see the point.\n\nAs I\u2019ve said, there\u2019s a lot of reasons to do a stock buyback. But this magnitude and at this price have left me guessing.\n\nI like to think it\u2019s optimism of their future. And that two years from now the stock is going to be much higher. In which case it made perfect sense to buy now.\n\nThat\u2019s my hope anyways. \n\nEdit: sorry for typos my phone won\u2019t let me scroll back for some reason",

    "selftext": "I am trying to level up my game, and for a pretty long time I just looked at the balance sheet, a few ratios, P/E, forward P/E, compared these to the industry average, healthy cash flow, debt etc. Most of the time I just did this on well known stocks, MSFT, AAPL, NVDA, INTC, AMD, META etc. basically companies you hear about a lot everywhere, I just had no trust in lesser known companies to outperform the market, even if these basic metrics were promising.\n\nNow it worked out relatively well since I started investing, but I feel like I didn't really beat the market by too much with my stock picks given the extra risk I took. There was a study by\u00a0[Cornell](https://www.cornell-capital.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/2024-Q2-Memo.pdf?_bhlid=91b22f94067500de4f838bfb72c6cdab059cf3dc), where one of the graphs show the % of SP500 stocks beating the SP500, and while the data doesn't go back too much -would love to see one that goes back until 1970-1980 at least-. however for the 2014-2023 period it can be seen that about 40-50% of the companies beat the 'market'. So basically if you stock pick with a random generator you have a good chance to have a similar performance to the market. So I believe with a proper educated research it would be possible to tip the scales in our favor.\n\nSo I feel like the way I picked stocks was sort of look at the most hyped and known companies, have a basic glance on some ratios and the balance sheet, and I feel like this is so bad that it will bite back after a while. I see quite a few people here on reddit and some other communities knowing so much about a company, the moat they have, why it's a good investment, why it would be a bad one etc. What is the proper approach to get information? What sources are valuable? I assume earning reports are one, but I doubt they have all the information of the industry the company is in, why it's better than competitors etc. surely there are some other sources that are used for all this.\n\nAny advice is appreciated!",

    "selftext": "I am 33, and started investing a couple of years ago. I cannot afford to invest much, I spend 250-300\u20ac a month on my investments. As I started I just bought a bunch of \"stuff\" since I didn't understand much (not like I do now). So anyways, I recently started diversifying my portfolio, sold the penny stocks I saw online that might \"blow\" and was left with couple of etfs, Nvidia, AMD S&P500.  \nSo I decided to allocate that monthly budged into savings plan, and my broker allows it without any fees. I left majority of my money in Nvidia and S&P. I then spent the remaining money on mix of mostly etfs. I diversified in sectors like tech, healthcare, real estate, energy, financials, communication services.\n\nNow I am worried, are those relatively small investments (10\u20ac a month, or even 5\u20ac for Global energy etf) gonna hurt my portfolio in long run? Could I end up investing in everything and later getting nothing, while I could have taken 5 \"good\" stocks or etfs and invest 50\u20ac each and have better growth potential?",

    "title": "Analyzing the Analysts: Using average analyst price target to identify possible buying opportunities amongst the top 100 companies in the S&P",
    "selftext": "Hello everyone,\n\nI'm a lazy investor and don't like to do much due diligence, but I do like to make money. Unfortunately these two things about me are often at odds as I've lost money in the past for not doing my DD. As such, I continue to be lazy but I try and find ways to work around doing due diligence and hopefully finding loop holes.\n\nOne such way that I have been thinking about recently is using analyst ratings, reviews and price targets as a surrogate for due diligence. In essence, I try to just have these analysts do the work for me. An idea I had is that much in the same way that with those who believe in technical analysis hold that everything you need to know about a stock is baked into it's price action, and so when something good happens the stock price goes up and when something bad happens the stock price goes down, thus all you need is to analyze trends in stock price and you'll be analyzing everything about the stock by proxy, I have a thesis (or theory) that perhaps you can do the same or something similar with analyst price targets of companies.\n\nNow I know that anyone who has read this far, already thinks I'm an idiot. Many experienced individual investors probably find market analysts to be stupid and therefor I'm stupid for following their lead, but I would argue to the contrary for a few reasons. As much as I have put in a lot of effort to learn about how the market operates (been investing for the last 6 years, started learning actively about it as much as I could a couple years prior to that), there is still much I don't know as I don't have a finance or economics degree. Moreover, as bad as you may think an analyst is, they are at least competent enough to keep their job as an analyst at the investment firm that allows them to make stock price target selections. Lastly, and most importantly, what I am about to discuss below uses the aggregate of several analyst price targets so I'm not relying on a single analyst but several (probably between 10 and 40 per company). I think if two-dozen analysts are strongly in favor of a company, it is unlikely that my novice investor wisdom would have researched the company and found a flaw that they all missed.\n\nSo what I did yesterday evening was go through the top 100 S&P 500 companies by market cap and find the current average price target for them on Yahoo Finance. I then divided the current stock price (at the close on 7/31) by that price target and expressed it as a percentage to see how far off the company was from the average price target analysts were aiming for. Then I also listed how many total ratings each company had, and how many of them were 'Strong Buys' and 'Buys'.\n\nThis yielded the following table:\n\n|+|A|B|C|D|E|F|G|H|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|1|Company|Current Price|Price Target|Percent to Target|Total Ratings|# Strong Buy Ratings|# Buy Ratings|% of Ratings that were Strong

This lead me to the following 11 companies:\nMicron Technologies (MU), Boston Scientific (BSX), Abbot Laboratories (ABT), Merck Scientific (MRK), Stryker (SYK), The Cigna Group (CI), Broadcom (AVGO), Comcast (CMCSA), Honeywell International (HON), Analogue Devices (ADI), and Intuit Inc. (INTU)\n\nI have about $5,000 I'd like to invest right now and I have half a mind to just put it equally weighted into these 11 companies and just watch it for the next year or two. I'll either do that or put it all in VOO, but I have a feeling that these 11 companies might beat the S&P 500 over the next 24 months.\n\nWhat do you guys think?",

I kind of have mine grouped in a low/medium/high segmentation and trying to figure out which I feel most comfortable with.

I am not sure I would hang on to this strategy long term but instead wait to see if it can get over 100k and cash out and then go down to more of a Medium Risk - if I went this route.\n\n**Medium Risk - Tech Heavy with some ETFs**\n\nHeavy with some of the big tech like AAPL, NVDA, MSFT, AMD, etc.... along with some funds like SPY, QQQ and SCHD.  This one feels like it could go very well in the next 5-10 years if tech and AI continue to be the forefront of the conversation.  It's still not really that diversified but feels like it could maximize returns on the happy path.\n\n**Low Risk - Retirement centric 2030 or 2035 target funds** \n\nAlmost completely fund based where the investments could be spread amongst a few funds that are 2030 or 2035 target retirement funds and would have the requisite risk associated with retiring in the near term.",

He said, \"Definitely hold on to your Apple position. It's too central a figure in the whole story.\"\n\nAccording to him, people would naturally want AI apps on their phones.\n\nIn an interview last month, he explained, \"I have an iPhone, and when those apps come out, I'll need a new phone. I'll need a new iPad, a new laptop,\" adding that the easiest way to play AI is \"Nvidia, AMD, a few other chip players, and anybody in the cloud with a massive database. Beyond that, there's Apple...After that, it's unclear because so much of what's going to happen is unknown.\"",

    "selftext": "I have a broad portfolio and have been holding AMD since around $14.\n\nI now need to liquidate a considerable part of my portfolio for financial reasons. Only a part of the portfolio will remain. The question is whether AMD should be one of the select 4-5 stocks to hold for the long term, say 10-20 years - next to VUAA which will remain the major chunk of my portfolio.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this - is AMD really a hold for the long term? Or should I take my gains and begone with it?\n\nJust for info: my other \"Hold\" stocks are MSFT, AAPL, MCD and maybe 1-2 others.\n\nEDIT: wow, thanks for all the answers so far, there were some amazing replies, truly appreciate it! Also makes me very uplifted and optimistic that not everyone is as obstructive as some ... But I guess every group has to have a few of those right?\n\nEDIT 2: after some further research and, yes, your inputs (thanks everyone!) I have decided to sell. Not putting this here to give everyone closure hahah... but to make it easier to check whether I made the right decision. Date of sale: June 17, 2024.",

Insight\u00a0\n2. Conviction\u00a0\n3. Patience\n\n**Insight**\n\nI\u2019ve learned to largely ignore headlines and talking heads, which seem more reactionary than insightful and optimizing for entertainment (clicks/views).\u00a0\n\nBen Graham\u2019s quote rings true:\u00a0\n\n>\u201cIn the short run, the market is a voting machine but in the long run, it is a weighing machine.\u201d\n\nPerhaps counterintuitively, I\u2019ve found it more useful to read/listen to tech/business analysts who focus on strategy and how that interacts with macro trends (along with financials) than solely financial analysts and stock pickers.\u00a0\n\nFinancials are a good indicator of fundamentals, but are backward-looking. However, valuation is forward-looking, thus driven by strategy x trends x structural advantages, so we must consider both.\u00a0\n\n# Math\n\nIn 2023 I also started\u00a0practicing math daily\u00a0(243 days straight\u00a0as of this morning) in order to better understand the mathematics behind AI. As part of that, I had to take remedial coursework to build my foundations since it had been so long since I\u2019d done any meaningful math.\u00a0\n\nI\u2019m not sure how much, but it\u00a0*feels*\u00a0like it helped with the reallocation decisions I made in late 2023 and early 2024. I felt more confident and deliberate in making trades. The math journey has been quite challenging, but personally rewarding, whether it has helped or not.\u00a0\n\n**Conviction**\n\nA big part of this is just a better understanding of myself and what kind of investor I am. I invest in what I believe in long-term.\u00a0\n\nHowever, someone trading on volatility with a much shorter timeline may not care about conviction. You must understand what investment philosophy aligns with your psychology and your strengths.\u00a0\n\nConviction investing works for me because, even when building products (my day job), I\u2019ve always been strong with product vision/strategy and always building for the future, so it makes sense that I invest the same way. I\u2019m not sure why it took me so long to connect those dots, but I\u2019m happy I did.\u00a0\n\nA big part of this is also timing. AI seems to be a once-in-a-generation opportunity. Whereas 5 years ago I might have tried to force myself to believe crypto was the next big thing in the absence of anything substantial.\u00a0\n\nThis is another reminder that success (in investing or otherwise) is all about timing and opportunity. When opportunities arise,\u00a0you must seize them.\n\n**Patience**\n\nAs a result of my convictions, I\u2019m much more patient in my investing these days and don\u2019t react to the day-to-day.\u00a0\n\nI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if I don\u2019t make another trade for the rest of 2024.\n\n**UPDATE:**\n\nA commenter asked about benchmarks, which I failed to include since I don't pay attention to them, so I had to look it up:\n\nI opened my portfolio in June 2022. Since then the cumulative S&P return is \\~28% (\\~39% for Nasdaq). My cumulative return for that same period is around \\~215%. The annual rate of return (per my Vanguard dashboard) is 77.9% as mentioned in the original post. I would expect my returns to revert to the mean over time.",

For all that time, I never felt the urge to venture into other investments until the recent buzz surrounding AI. Like everyone else, I was wowed by NVDA's stellar performance, just as AAPL seemed to hit a plateau and face some challenges.  \nAs a result, I offloaded half of my AAPL in November for NVDA. Come January, I found myself questioning why I hadn't just sold the whole lot, especially considering that one's growth trajectory was bound to outshine the other in the same timeframe. However, by then, NVDA had already nearly doubled. This prompted me to scrutinize the market more closely, leading to selling off the remaining half of my AAPL and diversifying my portfolio.  \nToday, here's where I stand:  \n\\- 61% NVDA  \n\\- 11% SMTC  \n\\- 9% MSFT  \n\\- 6% ORCL  \n\\- 6% MU  \n\\- 3% MRVL  \n\\- 2.5% AMD  \n\\- 2.5% PLTR  \nFirst off, I'm keen to hear your take on this mix of investments. Secondly, I'm pondering why I opted for seven different stocks instead of going all-in on NVDA, much like I did with AAPL in 2008. Let's be clear: I chose these stocks because I believe they offer reasonable profit prospects over a 3 to 5-year window for the entire portfolio. However, I'm still convinced that within a one-year timeframe, NVDA is likely to outperform the rest.  \nBottom line: Did I make the sensible move by diversifying across different stocks, or does my gut feeling that I should focus on the big player hold merit?",

There might have been a year that I nominally missed but if you add up all my investments and look at the gains, it\u2019s significantly higher than if I just invested in a boring S&P ETF.  My Fidelity account does this for me automatically and I\u2019ve always been higher\u2026for over a decade now. \n\nSo hear me out, I\u2019ve made some dumb mistakes and lost $$$ along the way but my winners have always offset that. My game plan is pretty simple: always invest in large cap stocks.  \n\nWith a diverse portfolio made up of Microsoft, Nvidia, Facebook (now meta), Amazon, Tesla, Apple, Nvidia, Amd, and a few others, I\u2019ve found this sector completely destroys the overall \u201cmarket.\u201d Sure I have a few outliers like Home Depot and OLIN but when I look at my pie chart, it\u2019s very aggressive and very heavily in tech.  \n\nThe difference in the S&P vs the NASDAQ confirms this over the last 20 years or more and you could argue I\u2019ve built my own sort of NASDAQ mutual fund in a ways, but I\u2019m still beating the NASDAQ too.  \n\nThe contrarian\u2019s argument is that given enough time, my large cap tech picks will eventually falter and I will begin losing but at the amount I\u2019m up right now, for over a decade, that correction would have to be astronomical and I don\u2019t see how the whole world economy wouldn\u2019t fall if these tech picks crash down 50% at once.  \n\nI\u2019m not trying to brag or troll this group or anything like that.  I\u2019m just genuinely interested to know if tech has made it relatively easy to now beat the overall market, and if so, what consequences does that have on the stability of the whole market if more investors start doing what I\u2019m doing?  \n\nIs there a point where the \u201cmarket\u201d is all tech now?  It sure feels like the S&P is so heavily weighted by tech now that maybe that\u2019s the real underlying answer to my question.  ",

    "title": "Risks of investing in ETP (Exchange Traded Products) compared to CFDs and futures?",
    "selftext": "Update: After reading some articles and examples Daily ETP have Stop-Loss in them unfortunately... This means that long ETP would trigger a SL if the underlying stock drops \\~16.6% in a single day. So that's how the ETP originators earn money.  \n\nHello Everyone,\n\nWhy are retail traders not completely ignoring CFD trades and going all in on low priced leveraged ETPs (pennies)?\n\nExample is GraniteShares 3x Long AMD Daily ETC (3LAM.L) currently just 2.74$\n\nWe all know that chances are AMD will be more valuable in a year compared to now, as the AI hype wouldn't die in a year. There is too much market share to be taken away from Nvidia and the market doesn't even have too - the demand is currently way higher than the supply, so it's only a plus! The issue with futures and CFDs are that you pay fees, have stop loss and need to know very precisely how much and in which direction the market will move between the opening and closing of your position. With ETP you don't care, as you don't have daily fees or stop loss and inflation is your friend, as generally more money will be put into the profitable stocks sooner or later due to rising expenses and thus prices.\n\nThis ETP has made 20.1% in a day while AMD 5.25%\n\nThe NVDA equivalent has made from 6$ to 150$ in just a year. Using x5 leverage maybe could provide that return, but at a MASSIVE risk. How likely was it to lose money from NVDA 1 year ago by buying this ETP at just 6$? Similar ETPs for the other tech companies are already trading at far higher ranges than just 2-3$.\n\nFor some reason this Google ETP 3LAL hasn't reach it's ATH although currently GOOG is trading around ATH. I guess it has to do with when the ETP starts trading on the market or maybe it doesn't monitor stock splits/dillutions.\n\nI am wondering who is on the other sides of those ETP trades? You cannot convince me that people are shorting 3LAM while it's at a silly 2.74$ (was around 0.3$ when AMD was 80$) and AMD just recently started it's AI hyped bull run. Sure it already made around 300% in a year, but so did NVDA and AMD started from way lower market cap! I was actually shorting NVDA around 500-600$ range, as I didn't do any due diligence on it's main product behind everything :( - the Tensor A100 and how many orders were for it etc.\n\nPlease try to give me arguments why 3LAM would be a bad investment to buy and hold for 1 year if AMD - besides AMD getting priced less than 202$ per share? The fees is around 0.3% per trade without any daily fees from what I could tell.\n\nAnother example is 3LVW if you think Volkswagen will recover (I do) :). It has massive debt, but pays 8% in dividends.\n\nDisclaimer - I put have put my money where my mouth is, but I stay open to corrections about my understandings, as I have been proven very wrong recently about AMZN and why it's valued this high.\n\nWhy is math not working in some cases? Microstrategy did around x10 increase in a single year. The ETP did around 10 000 times increase?!\n\n3LMI went from 0.01$ to 337.71$ - it seems like the starting price is the biggest factor, as this is not just x30 times increase (due to the x3 leverage), but an insane 3 377 000% - good luck for any crypto to beat that!\n\nI couldn't find a single ETP in GraniteShares portfolio of products that achieved the opposite - starting from 1-10$ range and going down to 0.00001$ etc.",

But it is, according to Goldman Sachs, \u201cthe most important stock in the world.\u201d\n\nAnd we only have to look at the earnings call and how it snapped a sinking market back forward again adding more money to its cap in a day than any stock in history. \n\nOkay. Rah rah. But what about the competition? That much money and someone(s) are gonna try and steal a piece and poach your employees. \n\nSo this one is for the nays and even the yays like me who want perspective. \n\nFrom MarketWatch opinion piece:\n\nhttps://www.marketwatch.com/story/nvidia-is-the-magnificent-1-now-but-these-rivals-are-closing-in-3a382a8b?g=7cca269b-40cb-4e86-a320-c716dfd46439&mod=djem_mwnbulletin\n\n> The Nvidia bandwagon is packed and everyone is jumping on it. It\u2019s fun to be right and more fun to be right in good company. But what if everyone is wrong? Isn\u2019t it this type of mania and exuberance that should give the market pause? \n\n> Nvidia has effectively grown to more than 98% of the market for data-center graphics processing units, or GPUs, due to a complete lack of meaningful competition. This early lead has given the company unbounded pricing power, driving its margins in the most recent quarter to over 76%.\n\n> over the past few months we have seen signs of competition entering the market. This will affect Nvidia\u2019s margins and the company\u2019s ability to continue to grow at such a staggering rate. \n\n> the competition is coming from an array of places [in addition to AMD who is predicting $4B for their new GPU] that include a number of Nvidia\u2019s largest and most important customers. For example, Amazon.com Inc.\u2019s AWS cloud has its AI chips for training and inference, Microsoft recently announced its Maia AI chip, and Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google continues to innovate on its Tensor Processing Units (TPUs). Oracle Corp. and Meta Platforms Inc. are also developing AI chips in house. \n\n> not as much an indictment on Nvidia as they are a realization by these companies that overdependence on a single source for AI semiconductors is a risk\n\n> In short, competition is real and it is coming to Nvidia in a meaningful way. More competition pressures Nvidia\u2019s pricing, margins and market share, as well as its rates of revenue and EPS growth. ",

They only existed because that.com Bubble had lifted them so far they had Cash. Lotsa cash. But they were a joke for about a decade.\n\nBut the real big thing was almost none of those companies had a profit. They didn\u2019t make any money whatsoever. None. No business. They were burning through cash with expensive offices, expensive staff, oh man, salaries for tech workers were astronomical.\n\nThe companies that did have a profit, we\u2019re making pennies. Or there profit margins were incredibly slim. There were only handfuls of companies that were catapulted by the bubble that didn\u2019t meet this criteria.\n\nCisco was in a similar situation to Nvidia. Cisco built the tools that would enable this tremendous new technology. but their net profit margin was like 17%. Vastly less than nvidias. Nvidia forward p/e is 54. Ciscos was 150.\n\nIf it\u2019s a bubble, it\u2019s nowhere near the size of the.com bubble. S&P 500 is P/E of 22.

Nvidia forecasts that margin will remain around the same level for its ongoing quarter. \n\n> Nvidia\u2019s gross margins appear to be the second highest in the semiconductor industry, behind only those of Arm Holdings PLC ARM which licenses chip designs but doesn\u2019t sell its own chips directly. Arm\u2019s gross margins were roughly 93% in the December quarter. \n\n> Nvidia\u2019s margins stand out among those elsewhere in the chip sector. Intel Corp. INTC, reported a gross profit margin of 46% while Advanced Micro Devices Inc. AMD, reported a 40% margin in the fourth quarter\n\n> Nvidia did note that its margins for the latest quarter and the current one could represent a peak due to favorable component costs in the supply chain in the past few months. But Nvidia had \u201cvisibility\u201d into a mid-70% gross margin for the balance of this fiscal year, which would take margins back to where they were before this latest high-water mark.\n\n> In other words, even if Nvidia\u2019s margins come down a bit from here, they\u2019re still poised to sit above those from virtually every peer in the sector.",

    "selftext": "I don't know why but this topic has intrigued me a lot lately. So I'll start by saying that I'm a complete rookie on this. With this post, I merely intend to throw my thoughts out there to be challenged so I can learn from you guys.\n\nFrom a geopolitical point of view, Intel strikes me as the ideal solution to the West. But their stubbornness over the last two decades has been a huge disappointment for the industry. Delays, reduced reliability, unfulfilled promises, and an overall loss of trust from pretty much everyone. If I'm not mistaken, that has been the consequence of poor management and the refusal to explore either fabless chip design or to spin out the Fab as a service business.\n\nFrom what I've been reading, Nvidia and AMD have managed to get better chips, not because they have been better at designing them, but because the increased efficiencies of TSMC allowed them to go for lower nm.\n\nIf I understand this correctly, TSMC managed to get more efficient than Intel at manufacturing chips mostly for a couple of reasons: Taiwan's government subsidies and economies of scale. Functioning as a service that fabless chip designers could use to produce their chips has caused TSMC to engage in *a lot* more volume of chip manufacturing, as it's logical. That allows the economies of scale to kick in and make the processes more efficient. That paired with huge government support has the manufacturing at TSMC substantially more efficient than the one at Intel.\n\nNow TSMC is 100% based in Taiwan, which is a geopolitical ticking bomb. And everyone is now scrambling to diversify their way as far away from China and Taiwan as they can. I guess the Chips Act is the most obvious move from the US government in that direction. This is prompting Samsung and TSMC to invest in opening new fabs in the US. Europe seems to be in a similar direction, but perhaps with milder strokes.\n\n[I'm reading](https://www.reddit.com/r/hardware/comments/165c0mq/they_would_not_listen_to_us_inside_arizonas/) that TSMC is struggling to replicate its way of doing business in the US. That should pose a problem to the political move the Chips Act intended.\n\nBut I haven't mentioned Intel. They have experience in opening and managing fabs on American soil. They have obvious support from the American government and they have now embraced the idea of offering their fabbing services to fabless chip designers - which from my understanding should make their processes substantially more competitive.\n\nNow my conclusion of this whole thing is that Intel's success at spinning out new fabs that benefit from economies of scale is the key to this whole geopolitical knot. Maybe Samsung is another key player in this? I can sense there's *a lot* I'm not understanding or missing but I can't point my finger at what is it. Maybe someone over here can educate me a bit.",

Those two companies were responsible for 300,000 units, with the other 200,000 going to the rest: Oracle, Tencent, Google, and Amazon, Tesla, TickTok, Baidu, Alibaba.*  \n\n\n***Q3 reported revenue was 18 bills. The reported 500k number seems to be true.***    \n\n\n**Now the question is, who will be ordering another 500k batch in Q4? so that at least the Q4 result won't pale in comparison and won't be a disappointment for investors?**  \n\n\nMETA to the rescue (Hopefully)! As Zuckerberg stated:\n\n[*\u201cBy the end of this year, we\u2019re going to have around 350,000 Nvidia H100s. Or around 600,000 H100 equivalents of compute if you include other GPUs.\u201d*](https://www.pcmag.com/news/zuckerbergs-meta-is-spending-billions-to-buy-350000-nvidia-h100-gpus)  \n, which means they might order another 200k from Nvidia, or he may *\"find 2\\*x H100 equivalent to compute\"* to avoid paying a premium over generally specialized Nvidia GPUs and buy more specialized and power-to-output optimized ASICs chips like Google's TPUs.  \n\n  \nI don't think other big tech (Microsoft, OpenAI, and AWS) giants will order more GPUs because running a general-purpose GPU is very expensive: [Running ChatGPT is very expensive for the company. Each query costs roughly 4 cents, according to an analysis from Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon.](https://www.reuters.com/technology/chatgpt-owner-openai-is-exploring-making-its-own-ai-chips-sources-2023-10-06/)  \nGoogle already has its own ASICs chips called TPU.   \nApple also has an edge with its M3 chips family. If their name is not on the Nvidia order line list yet, then they are certainly cooking some big updates to their M chip family.   \n\n\nEveryone has shown with their dollar that they aren't willing to pay a high NVIDIA premium in the long run.  And want to diversify to other chip makers, like AMD, Intel, and specialized ARM makers.  \n\n\nSmall businesses experiment and run their AI models using rented Amazon, Microsoft, and Google cloud capacities (mostly Google because of their TPU's low power-to-cost ratio).   \n\n\nThe rest of the market is peanuts to make any dent.   \n\n\n**\\[Conclusions\\]:** Their a moderate-low probability Q4 revenues will reach a plateau of around 15-20 billion.  A moderate probability that they will be below 15 billion. A low probability of exceeding 20 billion.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***Let's sidestep to AI marker TAM topic,***   \n   \n[*Meanwhile, looking forward to 2027, the server market's value is estimated at a staggering $195.6 billion.*](https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/nvidia-ai-and-hpc-gpu-sales-reportedly-approached-half-a-million-units-in-q3-thanks-to-meta-facebook)  \nHowever, this estimated revenue will be brought by those who rent AI processing capacities like AWS, GCP, and Azure cloud providers. And not ChatGPT clones. The market has not figured yet the TAM (total addressable market) of services like ChatGPT.    \n\n\nHowever, I try to speculate on [open numbers](https://explodingtopics.com/blog/chatgpt-users), which have stagnated for the last 6 months.   \n\n\n100 million monthly active users \\* 10$ per subscription produces 1 billion in revenue.   \n[The average cost of 1 query from a used is 4 cents](https://www.reuters.com/technology/chatgpt-owner-openai-is-exploring-making-its-own-ai-chips-sources-2023-10-06/).    \nA single user runs 2,000 queries per month on average. The query is a single text message you send to the chatbot.     \n2000 \\* 0.04 = 80 $ to service 1 user per month.   \nUntil the OpenAI level of efficiency improves they will be losing 70$ to service 1 user per month.   \nNo wonder OpenAI has closed its ChatGPT Plus subscription.  It doesn't seem sustainable.\n\n  \nLast note,\n\nthe majority of data centers upgrade their equipment every 4-5 years. So, if AI expectations won't burst, and chip efficiency improves 10-fold, and other chip makers won't catch up, don't expect big tech to re-stock their chips earlier than the end of 2027.   \n\n\n&#x200B;",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone!\nI am going to start off by saying that I was interested in the stock market since I turned 17. Before that I was an absolute computer nerd, building custom pcs and selling them, trading graphics cards, etc. I put my savings in a pension fund that was started by my father for me. Unfortunately it was restricted for sale until I turned 21. When I was 18 in 2016 I wanted to invest in AMD, but my bank advisor and my family (who are conservative farmers in central europe) forbid me to take out any money to start a stock account. I had no cash because I sadly developed a heavy trinking problem that I still can't shake off, so I just cruised along, dropped out of school, worked factory and construction jobs and didn't think about investing until I was 21. At that point I was able to take out the money from the pension fund, looked at the prices of AMD. And instead of investing in AMD or similar big tech companys, I got angry at missing out on a 30x play and started off betting tons of money on companys on the brink of bankruptcy. Ofcourse non of the stocks I invested in recovered and I started options trading which put me further in a hole. I managed to lose over 70k when I turned 23. On the site I developed an addiction for casino and sports betting aswell, fast forward to now. I am 26, lost 110k, have 20k gambling debt, unemployed, family disowned me (my father starts a fight everytime I see him) and everytime I have more than 1k of cash I burn it on options. I fail miserably everytime. Just yesterday for whatever reason I bought pypl Jan 19 puts with a strike of 60$ just minutes before the CEO made a positive announcement and the bull run took off. \nI don't even know why I did it, because my sentiment on Paypal is positive aswell. Just last week I convinced my brother to buy 10k of pypl stock. \n\nI generally give good advise to people, but somehow manage to make my own trades exactly the opposite of what I would suggest to peers. \n\nI just don't know what to do anymore and feel like I am living in a real life hell. \nI have been to 25+ job interviews but no one would give me a good opportunity and I have a feeling people and employers just want nothing to do with me. \n\nDoes anyone know what they would do in my situation?",

    "selftext": "Hey all! Just trying to familiarize myself with some of the most talked about investment opportunities in the market right now as well as potential stock picks for each. Feel free to correct any info here or add on more. Just looking to start a discussion on the different hot topics lately and the following stock picks that go along with them! I know there are several other big opportunities like weed,crypto,etc just didn\u2019t wanna go overboard\n\n**Lithium ( MALRY, LAC)**The booming EV market, along awith the growing demand for renewable energy storage, positions lithium as a key investment opportunity. Major automaker's substantial investments in EVs drive the need for lithium-ion batteries, while the increasing focus on sustainable energy ensures a sustained demand for lithium. Despite global lithium deposits, the challenge of securing a stable and cost-effective supply persists, presenting investment potential in companies involved in lithium exploration, mining, and battery production.\n\n**GPUs (NVIDIA, AMD, INTL )**Demand for GPUs comes from AI and machine learning for handling big data in areas like healthcare and finance. Data centers need GPUs for cloud computing as businesses shift operations online. In the gaming industry, GPUs are crucial for high-quality graphics in video games. Cryptocurrency mining, particularly for coins like Ethereum, relies on GPUs for their processing power. Overall, the demand is driven by the growing need for high-performance GPUs in AI, data centers, gaming, and cryptocurrency mining.\n\n**Uranium (BHP, NXE )**The demand for uranium primarily stems from its crucial role in fueling nuclear power generation. As global efforts to transition to cleaner energy sources intensify, the demand for nuclear energy has been on the rise, particularly in emerging economies like China and India. This growing demand, coupled with supply constraints and geopolitical factors affecting uranium production, creates a decent investment opportunity. As countries strive to meet their energy needs while minimizing carbon emissions, uranium stands out as a key component in the clean energy landscape.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAre you betting on any of these? If not what are you looking at?",

    "selftext": "LINKS to outlooks:  \n* [BlackRock](https://www.blackrock.com/corporate/literature/whitepaper/bii-global-outlook-2024.pdf)\n* [JP Morgan](https://www.jpmorgan.com/insights/global-research/outlook/market-outlook)\n* [Citi](https://www.privatebank.citibank.com/doc/investments/outlook/Citi_Wealth-Outlook-2024.pdf.coredownload.inline.pdf)\n* [Mastercard](https://www.mastercardservices.com/en/advisors/economics/insights/economic-outlook-2024)\n* [Charles Schwab](https://www.schwab.com/learn/story/2024-global-outlook-big-picture)\n\nI reviewed the 2024 market outlooks of JP Morgan, BlackRock, Citi, Mastercard, and Charles Schwab. This is a summary of their overarching themes.\n\n# Themes\n\n**\ud83d\udca1Inflation and interest rates will fall**\n\nThe five firms agree that inflation will continue to fall throughout 2024, giving central banks room to cut interest rates.\n\nEven JP Morgan, the only firm that published a bearish outlook, predicts US inflation will drop to 2.1% with the Fed starting to cut interest rates in the third quarter.\n\nIt\u2019s important to keep in mind that the past three recessions started right after the Fed started cutting interest rates. Expect the market to be more antsy as we near the first rate cut later this year.\n\n**\ud83d\udca1CapEx returns**\n\nLast year, companies (and pretty much everyone else in the economy) were nervous about an impending economic slowdown and companies cut back on spending.\n\nWith economic angst subsiding this year, CapEx is expected to bounce back.\n\nMore CapEx means higher revenues and faster growth. This is ultimately good for stock prices.\n\n**\ud83d\udca1US election year**\n\nFed unlikely to do drastic policy changes this year, don't want to stir the pot during election.\n\nLess policy volatility is good for markets.\n\nLargely a nothing burger. If Dems win, business-as-usual. If Reps win, market won't be disappointed since Reps are considered market-friendly. A Rep win is bad for war stocks though.\n\n**\ud83d\udca1First half angst, second half gains**\n\nCiti predicts that economic growth will be slow in the first half of 2024 before accelerating in the second half. They don\u2019t see a recession happening.\n\nBlackRock also sees the economy slowly recovering this year in a \u201cU-shaped\u201d fashion.\n\nTom Lee also thinks it'd be a \"slow then grow\" year. He predicts that the S&P 500 will be flat or down 5% in the first half of the year before rallying to 5,200 by year-end.\n\n**\ud83d\udca1Everyone is bullish on AI**\n\nThe Mag 7 is a good way to get AI exposure, as are chip designers like Nvidia and AMD. Citi is particularly bullish on chip manufacturers given their relative under-performance last year (e.g. TSMC).\n\nIn addition, Citi believes that AI has the most potential to uplift these industry segments:\n\n* Mag 7 (mega cap tech)\n* Infrastructure (chipmakers, semiconductor equipment, data centers)\n* Robotics\n* Drug discovery\n* Cybersecurity\n\n**\ud83d\udca1International: Japan, China, and India**\n\nFor international markets, the five firms are generally bullish on Japan, China, and India while being lukewarm on Europe.\n\nThe high level bull case for Japan is that the BOJ will finally have to seriously raise interest rates this year. This will lead to a stronger yen, attract more foreign investment into the Japanese economy, and ultimately drive up the dollar value of Japanese tech and finance stocks.\n\nCool point from Charles Schwab on the power of Japan in global finance:\n\n>Moves by the Bank Of Japan (BOJ) could overshadow those by the Federal Reserve and other central banks if Japanese investors begin to sell foreign bonds, stocks, and currencies. Decades of current account surpluses have accumulated, giving Japan the world's largest net international investment position (even more than China) with $3.3 trillion of investments held abroad according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Although the U.S. has the largest economic influence in the world, Japan may have the largest influence in the asset markets due to these account surpluses. Should the BOJ begin to substantially tighten monetary policy next year, as signaled by the end of yield curve control at the BOJ's meeting in October, the potential for a reversal of decades of outward flow of capital may be felt by investors worldwide. With rates rising in Japan contrasting with rate cuts elsewhere, the yen could surge along with Japanese bond yields, prompting Japanese investors to bring their money home and invest in Japanese assets.\n\n# Risks\n\n**\ud83d\udca1Economic risks**\n\nInterest rates and inflation are top of mind.\n\nThe general worry is that we haven\u2019t felt the full negative effects of 2021-2022\u2019s large interest rate hikes (perhaps they surface this year?) AND there\u2019s a high chance we\u2019re entering into a high interest rate and high inflation economic environment.\n\n**\ud83d\udca1Geopolitical Risks**\n\nEvery firm warned about geopolitical risks in 2024, from the ongoing wars in Eastern Europe and the Middle East to tensions in the South China Sea. A couple firms recommended defense and energy stocks as a hedge against these risks.\n\nMy contrarian opinion is that 2024 is a year of geopolitical normalization with the major geopolitical hot spots of yesteryear cooling down.\n\nThe Red Sea shipping crisis is an annoying thorn on the side of the global supply chain but it seems to be causing limited damage, for now.\n\nNot sure what China will do if Taiwan's 1/13 elections don't play out in their favor. Probably nothing serious as they've always done before.\n\n# Summary\n\nWith the exception of JP Morgan, everyone else seems to align on a general theme of \u201ceconomic normalization to growth\u201d for 2024. Citi sees the US economy going through three major phases from the start of the pandemic:\n\n* 2020-2021: emergency low rates and quantitative easing to stimulate the economy\n* 2022-2023: bear market caution as a result of rapid interest rate hikes and quantitative tightening\n* 2024-2025: normalization to growth\n\nWe agree with this prediction and see more upside for US stocks in 2024. Last year, the S&P 500 almost returned to all-time-highs despite having to climb a wall of worry from a myriad of economic and geopolitical risks. This year, many of those risks are subsiding, opening the way for stocks to go higher.",

Online I am reading that P/E is a gauge of investor sentiment on future growth in earning potential and is calculated based on prior 12 months of earnings.  AMDs P/E seems remarkable by comparison.  Does this not indicate that AMD is overbought?\n\nedit: I was considering AMD for investment, given recent company news and its momentum has largely been positive over the long-term.  This number stands out to me, and it isn't a positive indicator in my mind.  Looking to reconcile my opinion after hearing some of yours - thanks!",

    "selftext": "I joined eTrade in 2013 a few years after graduating college. I had set up automatic monthly contributions to my accounts, which I slowly raised over time and mostly invested in blue chip stocks. \n\nOn December 1, 2020, the combined value of my Roth and Traditional Brokerage account was just over $100k. It took me over seven years to get there and was a major milestone.  In the past three years, I have raised my monthly contributions, continued to invest, and am now just shy of $200k at the age of 35. You read about the power of compound gains all the time, but to go from $100k to $200k in three years when the first $100k took seven years is a testiment to that fact.  My goal is $1 mil by 47 and eventually to hit $2.5 mil before I retire. \n\nFor all you youngins out there, stick with it! But also, don't rush the process and try to hit home runs every day. For the most part, I am a buy and hold investor after a year or two of trying my hand at day trading with options and futures. When you chase the money, you won't make it. But if you\u2019re patient with a decent risk tolerance, anything is possible. \n\n\n\nEdit: Wow, thanks for the up votes everyone. It\u2019s been fun reading the comments. Adding some context here based on some of the questions that have come in. Monthly contributions are at $1,000 a month now, but in the early years they were less. When I first started, it was $100 a month and I worked my way up from there. There was a good chunk of time where they were between $200-$500 a month. These accounts were set up on my own, no employer match. I\u2019m not sure what my lifetime performance is, but the last three years I\u2019m up 30% overall. All that in mind, I can confidently say that well over half of my account is due to investment gains. \n\nInvestments have been all individual stocks that I typically hold for a year or longer. I pick them based on both technical and fundamental factors. This is more risky than ETFs and index funds but it suits my investing style and risk tolerance. I try to stick to profitable companies with a stock price that has a history of moving in the right direction, however I also like to buy at a discount price. I keep my eyes on charts and when there\u2019s opportunities to buy at historically undervalued prices I jump on it. There\u2019s really nothing super special to it. Not going to share my current exact portfolio, but stocks I have owned in the past or currently include AAPL, GOOGL, META, COST, HD, MCD, DKNG, AMD, DIS, and BAC to name a few. There are many others I\u2019m interested in buying that are on my watchlist.\n\nI will also add that I\u2019ve made a ton of mistakes along the way. Bad investments, selling too soon when I should of just held, taking risky, over leveraged day trades that resulted in nasty losses and wash sales. However, I\u2019ve learned from them and never done anything bad enough that blew an account or resulted in a draw down that couldn\u2019t be recovered. You can read all the books you want but I\u2019ve always found that the best way is to learn by doing and over time you develop your own skills and are able to trust your own analysis and decisions.",

I will probably have the Roth IRA managed by my retirement company once I exit those positions so I don\u2019t have to worry about it. I\u2019ll also be getting quite the tax harvest from the selling the positions in my brokerage account. \n\nWith all the losing positions I sell in my brokerage, I\u2019ll have ~40k of cash to do whatever with. The other ~$63k is invested in TSLA, Google, Microsoft, Apple, AMD & AMZN. I have a $30k position in TSLA, so that\u2019s most of it. \n\nI\u2019m thinking about taking the $40k I get from my losses and putting it in a HYSA, but not sure that would be the best thing to do. I think it would certainly be much less stressful than investing over $100k myself, but I also don\u2019t think I\u2019ll need the money very soon. \n\nI\u2019m single and currently live in Denver (I hate it here), and would love to be able to go to a warmer place, potentially San Diego if I can afford it. I don\u2019t know much about buying a house nor do I feel confident enough in a city to buy one, so still renting for now. My rent is 2.3k here, and would be much higher in a place like SD. I\u2019m hoping to get a decent raise soon that would be closer to $200k, but not sure if it\u2019s gonna play out yet or not. \n\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated! Please be gentle because I know ARK was a mistake and I\u2019m trying to do the right things now. I\u2019m trying to get out of the mindset of recovering my losses through investments, and would like to be able to live more peacefully and not check the market every day. \n\nThank you!",

    "title": "Individual stocks vs ETF vs REIT vs Robo-investing",
    "selftext": "Which do you prefer, and are there any other reliable investment options to grow wealth?\n\nCurrently my portfolio is spread somewhat evenly across all 4 of these options.\n\nHere's some random thoughts of mine from my investing journey since 2017.\n\n**REIT**\n\nI really like REITs because of the monthly dividend. There's just something about buying something and having it payout each month that is very desirable to me. Even knowing the returns will never be that of an individual stock win, I just *really* like the concept and consistency of the REIT. I'm tempted to dump 50% of my investments into REIT for this reason alone.\n\n**Stocks**\n\nAs the old adage goes; Never buy an asset you don't understand. I figure that you should only buy a stock if you have a good reason, and I don't have much interest researching companies to try and find a good pick, though my mind could be changed on this if someone convinces me it's worth it.\n\nI work in tech so I have a decent understanding of what tech companies do and I've had a few winners that I bought with *some* foresight. I bought AMD at $30 when I saw that Intel was releasing inferior processors at higher cost and trying to prevent hardware reviewers from reviewing them. I bought COIN near its bottom when I saw their stability in the wake of the crypto exchange disasters, and knowing a halving event is on the horizon (verdict is still out on this buy of course). Other stocks like ABBV have done well for me over the years, but I have absolutely no idea why because I know little about the healthcare industry. I lost some money on ABNB, and again I couldn't tell you why because I've never researched this company. I bought the stock a while back because I thought that ABNB would obsolete hotels.\n\nOn a long enough timeline, the value of any individual stock will fall to zero. So the question is, when do you sell? Seems to me that playing the individual stock game requires consistent \"maintenance\" and I wonder if it is worth the effort.\n\nAlso how much effort is worth spending on statistical analysis like P/E, market cap, volume etc.. ?\n\n**ETF**\n\nSafe and reliable. But it seems like *everyone* is buying these nowadays and recommending that you buy them. I've had VOO and SCHD as my main investments for a while now, and they *seem* to do well. but I can't help but wonder, If you do what everyone else is doing, how could you ever hope to perform above average? Or does it simply come down to the fact that if you are putting more into the market than the average person, you'll come out ahead with an 'average' return?\n\nIs it possible for some kind of ETF apocalypse to happen where the market stagnates due to extreme diversification?\n\n**Robo-investing**\n\nOn march of 2022, in the wake of the insane COVID stimulus rally, I came to the conclusion that I had no idea how to understand the market and decided to switch to Betterment. I set the risk to 'max' and started putting 50% of my investment money into Betterment and the remaining 50% into my personal brokerage split between stocks, ETF and REIT. Since then it's gotten me a 5.2% actual return with IRR at 11.2%\n\nThis investment vehicle doesn't seem much different that just buying some ETF myself, but maybe there is some happy middle-ground between overly-managed (stocks or human managed funds) and unmanaged (ETF) funds?\n\nA major thorn in my side has been trying to understand foreign stocks vs US. Apparently there is an undulation where the U.S outperforms the rest of the world for several decades, followed by underperformance. I've bought some foreign stock ETFs but these have done poorly next to US companies. Betterment handles this automatically so I figure it's good to get some exposure here.\n\n**Conclusion?**\n\nAside from derivatives and betting on crypto or individual stocks, the investment world seems like a homogeneous bowl of diversified funds. I'm kind of bored of investing and really just do it because I don't know how else to grow wealth aside from trying to get into real-estate.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;",

The platform is robust, reliable, well supported, offers regular performance improvements, and is now ubiquitous with over 4million developers using it including nearly every AI developer on the planet.\n\nSo when a competitor comes to throw their hat in the ring, there is an enormous defensive position to overcome that includes a large user base who are getting reliable, quantifiable and predictable results.  \n\nSince 2014 predictions of Nvidia's demise in the data center have been constant from both mammoth technology companies (AMD, Intel, Google, Baidu) and startups alike.    But no one has been able to make a real dent in Nvidia's momentum and share -- not with CPUs, ASICs, FPGAs or any other technology.  In their core area of AI model training, Nvidia has between 85-95% market share depending on whose numbers you look at.   They are serving this with the largest, most complex mass produced semiconductor devices man can imagine.\n\nWhat about other GPUs?   GPUs have proven an excellent solution for the job, they are readily available, flexible and performant.  AMD and Intel are building new GPUs and pursuing as \" AI is their number 1 priority.\"  I expect these companies to pick up some business simply because Nvidia cannot service 100% of the demand they are creating.  But these well-regarded companies have a difficult hill to climb in software.  They need to make their products work as well as Nvidia's to be competitive, if they don't they will likely sell at a deep discount.\n\nA \"real\" competitive offering will have to exceed Nvidia's solution in both performance and ease of use.   I haven't seen that sort of competitor surface in the past 10 years, nor can I see one on the horizon.  There may be one lurking -- certainly a possibility -- but it will take 2-4 years minimum for that type of solution to come to market.   In the mean time, Nvidia is out re-architecting data centers with AI-centric chip solutions:  CPUs, GPUs, DPUs and networking and switching technology.  They continue to raise the bar for competitors.  Soon data center processing will be managed by AI techniques to yield better, faster, more power efficient results sooner.   \n\nNvidia owns data center acceleration -- the nexus of AI -- for the near term.  Is AI a real technology that has launched and will add value to human kind in innumerable ways, or does it sputter and fizzle into another \"AI winter\" from whence Nvidia becomes a footnote in history?   That is the question on this company's share price.  FPE, PS, DCF ?  These are just irrelevant metrics in this context.",

The market has responded, sending the company's stock up by 8%.\n\nSo, who else might ride the \"AI wave\" to success? Keep an eye on:\n\n* Graphics card manufacturers. GPU-based solutions are effective for AI training, so **AMD** and **Nvidia** expect increased demand in the data center segment.\n* Chipmakers like **TSMC** and **Samsung**. Server SSDs and other equipment producers will also see growth in demand.\n* Cloud AI service providers: These companies offer AI training and support services. In addition to **Microsoft's Azure AI**, consider **Amazon Web Services** and **IBM Automation**.\n* And of course, don't count out **Google**, which boasts a powerful cloud  service. Organizations without in-house AI computing power, from  research labs to online retailers, will rely on these providers. And  we've just recently seen **Google Bard**, a chatbot that has yet to conquer  the market.\n* Cybersecurity companies: AI isn't all good \u2013 it can be used maliciously  too. As AI becomes more accessible, cyber threats will increase,  boosting demand for companies that combat them effectively. Potential beneficiaries could include **Cisco**, **Cloudflare**, and **Gen Digital**.\n\nThis is a hot topic, and it\u2019s all but impossible to cover it completely in just one post, so please, share your thoughts on potential AI winners in the comments!",

    "selftext": "Below, I'm offering up the sectors  that I believe have the greatest potential for improved financial  performance, as well as those that may disappoint investors.\n\nI expect an increase in financial performance in the following areas:\n\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 Technology: Primarily, companies specializing in AI and hardware production.\n\n\u25aa **Nvidia (NVDA)** graphics cards remain highly popular among users, while **Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)** and **Intel (INTC)** may also signal a recovery in demand. AI product creators **Alphabet (GOOG)** and **Microsoft (MSFT)** could also see increased demand for their products in the coming quarters, boosting profits.\n\n2\ufe0f\u20e3  Cryptocurrency companies: Rising prices for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and  other coins are likely to boost profits from commissions for the **Coinbase** crypto exchange **(COIN)** and from the mining company **Marathon Digital (MARA)**.\n\n3\ufe0f\u20e3 Energy and precious metals mining:\n\n\u25aa Mineral prices (gold and silver) exhibited a growth trend in the reporting quarter. This could send profits for **Newmont (NEM)** and **Barrick Gold (GOLD)** soaring.\n\n\u25aa Increasing energy demand could result in higher revenues for **Peabody Energy (BTU)** and **Arch Resources (ARCH)**.\n\nLaggards:\n\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 Financial: Tightening credit conditions and deposit outflows are likely to primarily impact regional banks such as **First Republic Bank (FRC)**. Large banks, including those with investment banking divisions like **Bank of America (BAC)** and **JP Morgan (JPM)**,  could benefit from deposit inflows and increased asset values in the  stock market. However, the quality of their loan portfolios is  deteriorating, and reserves are growing.\n\nI'm not ready to add these shares to my portfolios, so I will continue to observe the dynamics of these stocks.\n\nAdditionally, the reports from **Wells Fargo (WFC)**, JP Morgan Chase, and **Citigroup (C)** showed decent results thanks to cost control and growth in net interest income.\n\n2\ufe0f\u20e3  Consumer: Stores, including online marketplaces, typically experience a  decline in demand in the 1st quarter following holiday sales. I  anticipate a drop in demand indicators from **Best Buy (BBY)**, **Walmart (WMT)**, **GAP (GPS)**, as well as **Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY)**, which faces bankruptcy.\n\n3\ufe0f\u20e3  Healthcare: The coronavirus pandemic and seasonal colds have subsided,  and the increased demand for drugs has dwindled. Medical companies such  as **Teva (TEVA)**, **Pfizer (PFE)**, and **Novavax (NVAX)** could increase spending on new drugs, which would impact shareholder returns negatively.\n\nConclusion:\n\nAdding  a sector to one list or another doesn't necessarily mean that after the  report is presented, all of the stocks in promising sectors will soar  while all of those in the laggard category will tank. Rather, these are  thoughts on on the medium- and long-term growth prospects of specific  sectors in my field of vision.",

    "selftext": "I have been following this field since new techniques in machine learning basically brought AI out of a dormancy in the 2012-2014 time frame.   There is no question the field of AI holds great potential and also great peril, like any technology it can be used for good or evil.  As investors, we look to identify opportunities before the rest of the market does, and hopefully, if we're nimble enough, we can make some money.\n\nThe subject I'm on is really the subject of HYPE around AI.  Since the beginning of the year (or really since Oct), the market in \"all things AI\" has just gone crazy.   Some stocks have recently doubled (C3.ai).  Many companies are jumping on the AI bandwagon, pivoting to spin their offerings to include some AI component.   This \"morning briefing\" from yahoo illustrates the buzz generating.  [https://newsletters.yahoo.net/H/2/v60000018630b0112d9e30726e96c660c0/4fc402b9-f414-4c5c-b036-5ff6110d2b19/HTML](https://newsletters.yahoo.net/H/2/v60000018630b0112d9e30726e96c660c0/4fc402b9-f414-4c5c-b036-5ff6110d2b19/HTML)\n\nSo I'm trying to test my thesis on whats investible, vs what is ethereal.   \n\nAI is going to permeate many processes in the business world.   Reports are at ChatGPT is the fastest technology to a million users from introduction.  [Open.AI](https://Open.AI), the creator of ChatGPT, is not a public company however.   Large Language Models are disruptive.  Google's core business of advertising appears to have the potential to be under threat by a competitive Microsoft Bing offering that provides \"just answers\" rather than a string of links from paid advertisers as google search does.\n\nWhat these examples point to is the idea the our world can change quickly.   Google, Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, Apple and similar players in China, Baidu, Alibaba, Tencent, are all investing in and running experiments on identifying where AI can be monetized for their businesses.   But I think these are the wrong places to look.   None of these business are going to transform their core businesses to become AI-centric.\n\nSo who is really AI-centric?     I can think of a handful of AI chip startups that have mostly failed.   I can think of a number of software companies ([C3.ai](https://C3.ai), PLTR, Unity, even Adobe appears be moving in that direction).  And there are a jillion software startups, but they are not really investible at this point unless you're a VC.  [https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/generative-ai-a-creative-new-world/](https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/generative-ai-a-creative-new-world/)\n\nTo me, there is only one company making money in AI at this point:  Nvidia.   They have a unique parallel processor that's been repurposed from PC gaming and now their machine learning business is larger than their core gaming business.   They have built a platform to tackle one of the largest AI problems, self driving, and are investing in another platform, called Omniverse that uses AI to help generate and simulate digital twin virtual worlds.   What makes them unique is they are investing in the basic research (digital biology, particle physics, medicine etc), and they have a moat around their hardware/software solution that appears to be keeping competition (AMD, Intel, QCOM) at bay.\n\nI've been invested in Nvidia for a while, and I was fortunate enough to initiate new positions in October, the problem with Nvidia is their valuations have now been stretched beyond reasonableness (again) by hype, for example, today's PE is 95 or something ridiculous.  The question to me is whether this is a long term ride, or whether to try and time the market in or out, or push back from the table and cash in the chips?\n\nThe AI hype train is just really getting rolling at what I would call the ordinary consumer level mainly due to ChatGPT.  And these hype cycles will oscillate.   My inclination is just stay long and bear the swings out as I've never been good at market timing.   \n\nSo my question is, what's your personal philosophy for managing a hot commodity?    Dip in dip out?   Ride up and down come hell or high water.   Or maybe a hybrid where you hold a core and try and time buys and sells of smaller blocks, like dollar cost averaging up and down?\n\nEither way, AI is really just getting off the ground.  This is one company making money in the space and I think they've got 10 years or more of growth ahead.",

I intend to look at the data they release in the upcoming earnings reports. As I look at that information what do you think are the most critical components of it to determine the outlook for these companies? I'm currently looking at their PE, Forward PE, Price to Earnings Growth and Price to Free Cash Flow. Stocks on my list at the moment are INTC, AMD, TSM and MU. This is in part because I'd like to buy an even lot eventually so that I can hedge and potentially profit with options. \n\nAs I see it right now INTC is a multiyear recovery story with a high dividend that may need to come down with all the capital outlay involved in their turnaround despite having plenty of free cash flow. While their PE looks cheap compared to some others their FPE looks about inline and analysts don't see much more room to the upside. I am wary.\n\nAMD looks like it has some potential despite having a high current PE their FPE looks to be a little but mostly inline. Their Price to Earnings Growth and Free Cash Flow look less attractive but at the moment analysts are still calling for some reasonable upside to the stock.\n\nTSM looks to be growing well according to the Price to Earnings Growth but the stock price has mostly priced that in and the Free Cashflow looks to be under pressure. Its 2.47% dividend is potentially under even more pressure than INTC according to the financials as it commits to expanding here in the states.\n\nLastly MU seems to be struggling the most with Cash Flow out of the four and potentially hitting a growth slowdown. \n\nThoughts about the companies themselves and advice about trying to determine the value of these businesses going forward are much appreciated.",

    "selftext": "Berkshire Hathaway had just invested $4.1B in $TSM (TSMC), which translates to 60.1 million shares of Taiwan Semiconductors shares. For those who are not familiar with the semiconductor industry, TSMC is one of the most dominating semiconductors companies in the world currently, working closely with companies like Apple, and competing with the giants $INTC $AMD and $NVDA.\n\n**Why did Warren Buffet buy TSMC now?**\n\nWarren Buffet stock picking strategy is pretty straightforward - companies with optimistic long-term prospects, sound financial health and profitability, and relatively low price-earning (PE) and price-to-book (PB) ratios. With strong EPS growth, P/E at one of its lowest points since 2012, it seems TSMC's Q3 fall made it a good opportunity in the eyes of Buffet.\n\n**Taiwan-China Risk for TSMC**\n\nOne of the main risks of investing in Taiwanian companies these days is the ongoing geopolitical crisis between China and Taiwan. In TSMC's case, just 10% of TSMC\u2019s revenue comes from China, while 50% is USA. This puts TSMC in a very good position against this crisis, as China needs TSMC more than the other way around. I can only guess Warren Buffet simply doesn't see China as a threat to the company.\n\n**Buffet Trims 20% of BYD for TSMC - What does it mean?**\n\nBuffet's position in $BYDDY , an EV auto company, was partly replaced with the new TSMC position. While many analysts believe Buffet's decision signals that he sees better prospects in semiconductors than electrical vehicles (EV), I believe Buffet simply sees the EV market as an overpriced market.\n\n**Should you invest in TSMC?**\n\nMy take - TSMC is a great value investment. A profitable company that paid stable cash dividends over 2 decades, and it maintained growth momentum despite the current downturn in tech. No doubt what's holding this stock right now is the China-Taiwan war, resulting in fearful investors that keep the stock undervalued. The major risk here is if China decides to invade Taiwan, other than that, TSMC is at a pretty clear buy point.\n\nI'll add my portfolio in the comments if you want, just let me know :)",

I'll give a list for what I got and my reasoning for each, beyond the obvious that tech seems here to stay for many years (which is my goal for these accounts, retirement).  \n\n1.  AMD - Makes excellent processors, seems to be if not already beating Intel in market share and technology due to their head start with their newer CPUs.  \n2.  MSFT - I don't think this needs elaboration.\n3.  RTX - Government defense contracts are a big reason, but they also own United Technologies now, which is a big manufacturer for HVAC components among other things, and in the future I see HVAC use trending upwards (if nothing else climate change will make things way hotter).  \n4.  TFC - Truist Financial, This is my bank is is actually a regional bank.  But they are also the 10th largest bank in the US with assets ($509 Billion).  Stock is just solid.  \n5.  TSM - They contract with both Intel and AMD for their processors.  So if nothing else, if Intel and AMD should fail, either move the losses to TSM or just get out of tech in general.  China poses a potential issue but I see this is a non-issue due to the rest of the world's reliance on Taiwan for their semiconductor production.  \n6.  VZ - Telecommunications company, I picked it over AT&T because it has far less debt.  This is the dividend stock of the group.  \n7.  WMG - Warner Music Group, I would have rather picked UMG but they're not public.  Music royalties mainly,  they have quite a few artist I like in their catalog.  \n\nNow, a preface:  should this be taken as due diligence for anyone?  No, not really, these are just MY personal picks, and I'm just trying to even it out because I don't like odd numbers.  All of these companies could fail in the future and I'd sell at a loss and put it into SPY like the rest of us.  But one of the best pieces of advice I ever heard was \"invest in things you understand\", and all of these are industries I've either worked in or am very familiar with.  I'm not investing expert.  \n\nThat said, I want my next pick to be something a bit more old money conservative, so I've been considering some more unorthodox options - like SPGI or CME.  Something that tracks the market (or literally OWNS the tracker, in these cases).  BRK.B also seems like a strong choice.  \n\nAny opinions?",

Instead, their aim was to investigate the development of a company based upon information and knowledge obtained from previous education and studies. Moreover, the underlying company for this valuation is Intel Corporation, since the authors aim to analyse a well reputable company with a strong market brand in a highly competitive market.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Secondary Data\n\nSecondary data is the information that doesn\u2019t require a direct collection or studies, this information is publicly available online for the public to be consulted. Meanwhile, primary data are information that has to be collected by direct means such as interviews, measurements or polls. In this paper, only secondary data and data derived from it are used. Following the main data related to the company that are mainly used for the evaluation models:\n\n|Data|Number|\n|:-|:-|\n|**Levered Beta**|**0.73**|\n|**Unlevered Beta**|**0.57**|\n|**CAPM**|**7.01%**|\n|**WACC**|**6.25%**|\n|**ROE**|**25.50%**|\n|**EPS**|**4.66**|\n|**P/E**|**5.65**|\n|**PEG ratio**|**4.43**|\n|Corp Tax|8.46%|\n|**Growth Rate Estimate**|**18.26%**|\n|Growth Rate Estimate with market risk|12.68%|\n|Analyst growth estimate|\\-3.60%|\n|Next 5y Analysts growth|\\-20.92%|\n|Intel\u2019s Corporate Bonds|4.77%|\n|Outstanding Shares|4,127,000,000|\n|Earnings distributed|28.41%|\n|Earnings retained|71.59%|\n\nnote: EPS is the EPS of last month, this is to compare the company in that time period to today's macro data.\n\n# Macro Economic Data\n\n|Data|Number|\n|:-|:-|\n|Market Expected Return|9.40%|\n|Risk Free Rate|4.21%|\n|Risk Premium|5.19%|\n|AAA Bond Yield|5.31%|\n|Average US GDP Growth|3.18%|\n|Current Market P/E|18.58|\n\n# Evaluation Methods\n\nIn this paper, five evaluation methods are used to evaluate the company's final fair value. Each method gives us different current fair values for a single share of the company. The final price tag is determined by the average price between all the methods used.\n\n## Growth Rate\n\n**The Growth Rate of 18.26%** is calculated taking in count the previous year earnings of 19.86 Billion, the retained percentage of the earnings that were not distributed of 71.59% and its historical ROE calculated by the average ROE of the last 4 years of 25.50%. The final Growth Rate is f **12.68%**, this number is found by subtracting risk premium from the growth rate. This is done as a precaution and reduction of overestimations.\n\n## Free Cash Flow Evaluation Model\n\nThis simple model takes in mind the company 2021 Free Cash Flow of $9.66 billion, its WACC based discounted rate of 6.25% and its Growth Rate of 12.68% to determine a fair value of **$41.05** per share.\n\n## Adjusted Graham Fair Value Formula\n\nThis model is used in the Value Investing communities to price tag a company based on its intrinsic value. This formula is created by Benjamin Graham, a value investor and professor at Columbia University who is considered the father of Value Investing.\n\n**Intrinsic value = EPS \u00d7 \\[(8.5 + (2 \u00d7 Expected annual growth rate, g)\\]**\n\nWhich 8.5 is the P/E base of a no-growth company, and the expected growth rate is the company perpetual growth rate for the future.\n\nIn 1974, in the revised edition of **The Intelligent Investor**, Graham revised the formula to\n\n**Intrinsic value = \\[EPS \u00d7 (8.5 + 2\\*g) \u00d7 4.4\\]/Y**\n\nIn this formula, 4.4 is the then prevailing (1962) rate on high-grade corporate bonds listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Y is the current yield on AAA-rated corporate bonds.\n\nGraham thought that as the investor had the choice between putting money in common stocks or bonds, it was appropriate to take into account the rate of interest paid on a high-grade bond of 4.4 per cent in determining the intrinsic value of a stock.\n\nIn this thesis we use an adjusted formula\n\n**Intrinsic value = \\[EPS \u00d7 (7 + 1\\*g) \u00d7 4.4\\]/Y**\n\nThe P/E of 7 is used because even if a company has zero growth prospects, but it is able to maintain cash flows and distribute dividends, its P/E is generally higher than 8.5.\n\nThe used growth rate is the one calculated.\n\nThe '2' multiplier is too aggressive. Graham never experienced companies with growth rates of 15-25 per cent, which is common today. Instead of '2', here it is used 1 instead.\n\nThe interest rate of 4.4 is left as the original, some modern adjustment put this value at 8.5, which is the five-year fixed deposit rate. This value is the substitute of the risk-free rate, which sometimes can be used instead of 4.4.\n\nData used for the calculation:\n\n|EPS|4.66|\n|:-|:-|\n|Growth Rate|12.68|\n|AAA Bond Yield|5.31|\n\nThe Adjusted Graham Intrinsic Value Formula gives us a price tag of **$75.98**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n## Discounted Unlevered Free Cash Flow Model\n\nA modified version of the traditional Discounted Cash Flow. This model instead of using the free cash flow, uses the unlevered one.\n\nUnlevered free cash flow (UFCF, also known as Free cash Flow to the Firm) is **the amount of available cash a firm has before accounting for its financial obligations**. Free cash flow (FCF), on the other hand, is the money a company has left over after paying its operating expenses and capital expenditures. It is used to remove the impact of capital structure on a firm's value and to make companies more comparable\n\nIn simple words. It is the cash flow of a company based on the belief that the company owes no debt, therefore has no interest payments to make.\n\nIn this model, it is taken in mind the following data:\n\n|WACC based discount rate|6.25%|\n|:-|:-|\n|Growth rate|12.68%|\n|Average US GDP growth rate|3.18%|\n|rage Shares outstanding|4,127,000,000|\n\nThis gives us a fair value of **$46.50**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n## Final Fair Value\n\nThe Final price tag is determined as per following:\n\n|Free Cash Flow Evaluation Model|**$41.05**|\n|:-|:-|\n|Adjusted Graham Fair Value Formula|**$75.98**|\n|Discounted Unleveread Free Cash Flow Model|**$46.50**|\n|**Final Fair Price (Average)**|**$32.71**|\n\nNote:  In the evaluation, the price took in  mind discounted dividends model and total payout model, which both give  an evaluation of $0 due to the fact that growth rate is higher than the  discount rate. So the average takes in count the three methods above plus the two zeros\n\nThe company pays dividends so in this case i priced in also the output of those two models too\n\n# Main Competitors\n\nIntel Corporation is in the Semiconductor\u2019s sector.\n\nAs the only leading-edge U.S. semiconductor company that **both develops and manufactures its own technology**, Intel has a widespread economic impact in every sector of the U.S. economy and a strategic advantage over its competitors. It is also the largest publicly traded semiconductor chipmaker in the United States.\n\nThe company is responsible for creating the x86 microprocessor, which is a part of nearly all personal computers today.\n\nDespite being a leader in its market, Intel operates in an area that has many players that compete for market share. Below are some of Intel's main competitors.\n\n|AMD - Advanced Micro Devices, like Intel, produces more than just microprocessors. Both companies create motherboards, servers, and other computer-related hardware. In terms of the x86 microprocessor, **AMD is Intel's biggest competitor.** Intel and AMD are rivals, much like Apple and Microsoft. They have certain specifications and dedicated users that will always stick to one over the other. Products from both companies are similar in price and quality. Though Intel's chips are primarily found in the computers of large companies, the competition between Intel and AMD comes down to individuals that build their own computers.|\n|:-|\n|IBM - International Business Machines is one of the first computer companies in the world, Founded in 1911, it was the pioneer in computer technology during the 20th century. The company developed the ATM, the hard disk, the floppy disk, the magnetic stripe, and many more. It is one of the 30 companies on the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) and one of the largest employers in the world. IBM used to produce computers using Intel's processors, but has since sold off that business and is now **selling its own servers and mainframes using its own processors, putting itself directly in competition with Intel.** The company launched a program to open source much of its architecture and firmware back in 2013, which attracted many new customers to using its Central Processing Units, stealing market share from Intel.|\n|NVIDIA - NVIDIA is one of the key players in the graphics processing unit (GPU) market. It is one of the **biggest names in video games**. It also designs **chips for mobile phones and automobiles**. Many of its chips are used in supercomputers, and it is now working on artificial intelligence. Intel released a new graphics card in the second half of 2021 that is competing directly with Nvidia's dominance in that field. It is used to compete in areas of data centre, artificial intelligence, and machine learning.|\n|Samsung - In 2018, it surpassed Intel as the largest semiconductor maker by revenue, but in 2019, Intel took that spot back. It's clear that both companies strive against one another for the top spot. Intel and Samsung don't compete in all fields, however. **Intel's products primarily focus on desktops and laptops, whereas Samsung focuses on semiconductors for smartphones and data centres.**|\n\n# The Products\n\n|**CGC \u2013 Client Computing Group** includes products designed for end-user form factors, focusing on higher growth segments of 2-in-1, thin and-light, commercial and gaming, and growing other products such as connectivity and graphics|\n|:-|\n|**NEX \u2013 Network and Edge Group** includes programmable platforms and high-performance connectivity and compute solutions designed for market segments such as cloud networking, communications networks, retail, industrial, healthcare, and vision.|\n|**DCAI \u2013 Datacenter and AI Group** includes a broad portfolio of CPUs, domain specific accelerators, FPGAs and memory, designed to empower datacenter and hyperscale solutions for diverse computing needs|\n|**AXG \u2013 Accelerated Computing System Graphics Group** includes CPUs for high performance computing (HPC) and GPUs targeted for a range of workloads and platforms from gaming and content creation to HPC and AI in the data centre|\n|**IFS \u2013 Intel Foundry Services** is a services provider offering a combination of leading-edge packaging and process technology, world-class differentiated internal IPs (i.e.: x86, graphics, AI), broad 3rd party ecosystem and silicon design support.|\n|**Mobileye** includes the development and deployment of advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and autonomous driving technologies and solutions.|\n\n# SWOT Analysis\n\n## Strengths\n\n* **Strong Industry position**: it has a strong market share in its major business segment. The main product is not easily copied.\n* **Economies of scale**: the microprocessor market i very large and Intel has a strong manufacturing plants\n* **Strong Research**: Intel\u2019s research team is highly professional, and made some breakthrough tech that cannot be copied by other manufacturers\n* **Strong partnership with Microsoft**: this partnership limits the market share growth of competitors\n* **Trustworthy raw material suppliers**: it has a solid base of reliable raw material suppliers\n* **Strong High-Tech culture**: its products are cutting edge innovations not easy to copy\n* **High Level of customer satisfaction**: It has a dedicated customer relation department that allows it to have a high level of customer satisfaction and brand recognition\n* **Strong Distribution Network**: It has developed a dependable distribution network that can reach the majority of its potential market\n* **High Free Cash Flow**: It has strong Free Cash Flow, which allows it to grow into new initiative and reinvest in the company\n* **Brand Recognition**: It has a strong brand recognition, positive perception of its products\n* **Social Media**: Intel invests in Social Media channel to reach its customers\n\n## Weaknesses\n\n* **High costs of goods**: It has high fixed costs which adversary affects profit margins\n* **High level of debt**: It has a lot of debt, which increases the interest costs on funds borrowed to finance activities.\n* **Declining PC sales**: the PC market is shrinking due to post Covid open up and cycle of the business\n* **High Dependency on the Main Segment**: Intel has a strong dependency on PC sales\n* **Limited Business Diversification**: Intel is facing challenges in diversifying. It is trying to enter the mobile phone, tablet and TV segments.\n* **Limited Customer Care in Developing Countries**: the company\u2019s customer care is less active in developing countries, missing new potential customers\n* **Weak R&D**: the company research and development division as a small investment compared to its revenue\n\n## Opportunities\n\n* **Apple Wants to diversify source of chips** stating Arizona as a possible source\n* **High Growth**: its products are expected to be in high demand in the next growth cycle\n* **Increase in Demand:** expected increase in demands for personal computers and servers\n* **Automatic Cars**: this market requires high-tech processors\n* **Drones**: their usage is growing year after year and is a great opportunity for Intel\n* **Developing Countries**: are expected to grow and are an opportunity to acquire new customers and partners\n* **Defence sector:** institutional contractors might demand Intel high-tech processors for strategic tech and services\n\n## Treats\n\n* **Competition**: Intel is a leading leader in its industry and is facing high pressure from competitors such as: AMD, NVIDIA, Qualcomm, Samsung\n* **Competitors\u2019 New product launches**:Competitors products are threatening Intel leadership\n* **Price sensitivity**: semiconductor market is a highly price sensitive market and cheaper products from competitors might drastically eat away Intel\u2019s market share\n* **Fluctuating PC sales**: Intel is too dependent on this segment\n* **Harmful regulations**: the company is facing harmful regulations from countries that are trying to erode the sale of Intel\u2019s products\n* **Geopolitical Events**: Semiconductors is a strategic industry for many countries and international political events might impact the company\n* **Reliance on third party manufacturers**: Intel and Manufacturers are highly dependent from each others\n\n# Financials\n\n## Income Statement\n\nIn the past three years the average increase in revenue has gone up by 0.10% showing a stagnation of sales with the growth from 2020 to 2021 being 0.47%. While having an average increase in operating expense of 2.14% with the last year increase, from 2020 to 2021, of 10.12% showing a spike in costs for the last operating period.\n\nIt is expected for the year 2022 to have both Costs and Revenue increase by approximately 18%\n\nA point of some concern might be the small decrease in net revenue in those past 4 years, confirming a stagnation of the business.\n\n## Balance Sheet\n\nThe 2021 balance sheet shows us\n\n* Short term debt of 4.59 Billion coverable by cash and cash equivalents plus account receivables, but not only by C&C alone\n* Long term debt is coverable by current assets alone\n* Increased stockholders equity, earnings are being retained in the company and reinvested\n\n## Cash Flows\n\nIntel has positive Cash Flow from Operations in the last four years. Same thing for Net Cash Flow. A reduction of both can be observed for the last year.\n\nThe Company has an Income Quality ratio of 1.51, which is good and signals a healthy income.\n\nINTC is investing heavily in PP&E\n\n# Revenue Forecast\n\nWith the release of the new Intel Arc 7, with has the potential and capability to rival and surpass its competitors, NVIDIA and AMD, and a increase in demand for the year 2023, it is forecasted a growth in revenue according to the growth rate calculated of 12.86%\n\n## Analysts Price Target\n\n**$72 High**\n\n**$32.74 Average**\n\n**$18 Low**\n\n**$32.71 OP\u2019s**\n\n# Final Considerations\n\n## What is its position compared to competitors?\n\nBy observing the industry and taking in count different factors such as geopolitical and market demands for electronics, we can forecast a possible development for Intel.\n\nINTC has a strong customer base and it is known worldwide for its contributions and development of cutting hedge technologies, this is well resonated especially in developing countries such as India, China, Nigeria and Indonesia.\n\nWhile its North American market share in Graphics and Motherboards got eroded by some percentage by its main competitor AMD, it still maintain a leadership position in the sector. We shall note that Intel operates in sectors which permit it to diversify a little bit its product\u2019s portfolio, where AMD doesn\u2019t have expertise nor is capable to compete.\n\nWith high inflation and interest rate corroding the whole market, it is expected to meet some possible downturn for the near period of time (3 to 6 months) and stabilise within a year while the FED is fighting the raising of costs. The company has strong fundamentals that shields it from possible adverse events in the near future and its cash flow quality is high.\n\nIntel Corporation is currently undervalued due to North American Market downtrend perception of it due to the rival\u2019s marketing attacks. It is also reasonable that the past CEO brought the company into stagnation and slowdown, but with the new one, with his expertise and experience, we can expect a turnaround and regain of some market share in the next few years.\n\nWith US Government subsidies for the semiconductor industry, we can see a deep strategic interest in bringing and boosting domestic productions and reducing potential risk from over relying on taiwanese manufacturers. This incentivised Intel to invest in two new fabs, one in Ohio and one in Arizona, plans to expand existing plants are already funded and another European production site is planned in Germany.\n\nSWOT analysis shows us many strong moats for the business, which are its competitive advantages over competitors. Huge potentials can be exploited if the company decided to pursue an expansion strategy into developing countries and markets.\n\nLack of insiders sell, which the last one in february 2022, shows us that the management is confident in the company's future development, which is confirmed by additional buying from the CEO itself in the last months. Big Institutions and Mutual Funds hold portions of the company too, signalling strong sentimento towards the company. Employees rating and satisfaction rate is high, salaries aren't that much different from rivals.\n\n## Is the company a Buy or a Sell?\n\nThe company is distributing regular dividends, it has strong fundamentals and lots of cash to meet adverse events. Institutions and insiders are holding. The current downtrend is due to market trend and social mechanism, of which contributed AMD marketing in damaging Intel\u2019s perception in the CPU segment.\n\nFundamentally though, the company has many potentials and growth opportunities, especially now with its new release Intel Arc 7.\n\nIntel is a smart investment for long term holders, not only because its intrinsic value is expected to grow, but also for the fact that it pays high dividend\u2019s yield. If the company was in a severe situation, it still can retain earnings to cover expenses, even if it is unlikely due to its present liquidity.\n\nThe cooldown of infration migh suggest a better economic landscape for 2023\n\nIn the end, the verdict is one: **Buy. Fair Value is $32.71.**\n\n**What are you thoughts? Is Intel a Buy or a Sell? Let us all know!**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***This is not a financial advice.***",

Those changes are due to its recent management team, which stagnated the company and slowed it with bad management decisions. With the new CEO Pat Gelsinger and his expertise, direct experience and know-how in the sector, the company is moving out from its slowdown and trying to catch up with its main rivals.\n\n## Purpose\n\nThe purpose of this thesis is to analyze the development of Intel Corporation (INTC) during the past four years, from 2018 to 2021 and forecast its activity for the next five years. Not only are the financial statements taken into consideration but also macroeconomics factors and its main competitor Advanced Micro Device (AMD).\n\nAll is made to answer the following questions:\n\n* What is its position compared to competitors?\n* Is the company a Buy or a Sell?\n\n## Hypothesis\n\n* INTC is not a dying company\n* INTC downtrend is following the sector and the market movement\n* INTC is a cyclical business, and we are in a down cycle\n* INTC investments will boost its revenues in the next five years\n* USA government will not allow one of its pivotal and strategic company to fail\n* INTC will face more stress as AMD is eating market share\n* INTC\u2019s new products are the top-notch of the sector\n\n# Methodology\n\nWhen the authors initially wrote this thesis, the intention was not to take the position of an expert in company valuation. Instead, their aim was to investigate the development of a company based upon information and knowledge obtained from previous education and studies. Moreover, the underlying company for this valuation is Intel Corporation, since the authors aim to analyse a well reputable company with a strong market brand in a highly competitive market.\n\n## Secondary Data\n\nSecondary data is the information that doesn\u2019t require a direct collection or studies, this information is publicly available online for the public to be consulted. Meanwhile, primary data are information that has to be collected by direct means such as interviews, measurements or polls. In this paper, only secondary data and data derived from it are used. Following the main data related to the company that are mainly used for the evaluation models:\n\n|Data|Number|\n|:-|:-|\n|**Levered Beta**|**0.71**|\n|**Unlevered Beta**|**0.54**|\n|**CAPM**|**7.01%**|\n|**WACC**|**6.45%**|\n|Hurdle Rate|11.64%|\n|**ROE**|**25.50%**|\n|**EPS**|**4.66**|\n|**P/E**|**5.65**|\n|**PEG ratio**|**4.43**|\n|Corp Tax|8.46%|\n|**Growth Rate Estimate**|**18.26%**|\n|Analyst growth estimate|\\-0.16%|\n|Next 5y Analysts growth|12.80%|\n|Intel\u2019s Corporate Bonds|4.77%|\n|Outstanding Shares|4,106,000,000|\n|Earnings distributed|28.41%|\n|Earnings retained|71.59%|\n\n# Macro Economic Data\n\n|Data|Number|\n|:-|:-|\n|Market Expected Return|9.40%|\n|Risk Free Rate|4.21%|\n|Risk Premium|5.19%|\n|AAA Bond Yield|5.31%|\n|Average US GDP Growth|3.18%|\n|Current Market P/E|18.58|\n\n# Evaluation Methods\n\nIn this paper, five evaluation methods are used to evaluate the company's final fair value. Each method gives us different current fair values for a single share of the company. The final price tag is determined by the average price between all the methods used.\n\n## Growth Rate\n\n**The Growth Rate of 18.26%** is calculated taking in count the previous year earnings of 19.86 Billion, the retained percentage of the earnings that were not distributed of 71.59% and its historical ROE calculated by the average ROE of the last 4 years of 25.50%.\n\n## Free Cash Flow Evaluation Model\n\nThis simple model takes in mind the company 2021 Free Cash Flow of 30 billion, its WACC based discounted rate of 6.45% and its Growth Rate of 18.26% to determine a fair value of **$23.57** per share.\n\n## Adjusted Graham Fair Value Formula\n\nThis model is used in the Value Investing communities to price tag a company based on its intrinsic value. This formula is created by Benjamin Graham, a value investor and professor at Columbia University who is considered the father of Value Investing.\n\n**Intrinsic value = EPS \u00d7 \\[(8.5 + (2 \u00d7 Expected annual growth rate, g)\\]**\n\nWhich 8.5 is the P/E base of a no-growth company, and the expected growth rate is the company perpetual growth rate for the future.\n\nIn 1974, in the revised edition of **The Intelligent Investor**, Graham revised the formula to\n\n**Intrinsic value = \\[EPS \u00d7 (8.5 + 2\\*g) \u00d7 4.4\\]/Y**\n\nIn this formula, 4.4 is the then prevailing (1962) rate on high-grade corporate bonds listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Y is the current yield on AAA-rated corporate bonds.\n\nGraham thought that as the investor had the choice between putting money in common stocks or bonds, it was appropriate to take into account the rate of interest paid on a high-grade bond of 4.4 per cent in determining the intrinsic value of a stock.\n\nIn this thesis we use an adjusted formula\n\n**Intrinsic value = \\[EPS \u00d7 (7 + 1\\*g) \u00d7 4.4\\]/Y**\n\nThe P/E of 7 is used because even if a company has zero growth prospects, but it is able to maintain cash flows and distribute dividends, its P/E is generally higher than 8.5.\n\nThe used growth rate is the one calculated.\n\nThe '2' multiplier is too aggressive. Graham never experienced companies with growth rates of 15-25 per cent, which is common today. Instead of '2', here it is used 1 instead.\n\nThe interest rate of 4.4 is left as the original, some modern adjustment put this value at 8.5, which is the five-year fixed deposit rate. This value is the substitute of the risk-free rate, which sometimes can be used instead of 4.4.\n\nData used for the calculation:\n\n|EPS|4.66|\n|:-|:-|\n|Growth Rate|18.26|\n|AAA Bond Yield|5.31|\n\nThe Adjusted Graham Intrinsic Value Formula gives us a price tag of **$97.53**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n## Discounted Unlevered Free Cash Flow Model\n\nA modified version of the traditional Discounted Cash Flow. This model instead of using the free cash flow, uses the unlevered one.\n\nUnlevered free cash flow (UFCF, also known as Free cash Flow to the Firm) is **the amount of available cash a firm has before accounting for its financial obligations**. Free cash flow (FCF), on the other hand, is the money a company has left over after paying its operating expenses and capital expenditures. It is used to remove the impact of capital structure on a firm's value and to make companies more comparable\n\nIn simple words. It is the cash flow of a company based on the belief that the company owes no debt, therefore has no interest payments to make.\n\nIn this model, it is taken in mind the following data:\n\n|WACC based discount rate|6.45%|\n|:-|:-|\n|Growth rate|18.26%|\n|Average US GDP growth rate|3.18%|\n|rage Shares outstanding|4,106,000,000|\n\n## Dividend Discount Model\n\nThe dividend discount model (DDM) is a quantitative method used for predicting the price of a company's stock based on the theory that its present-day price is worth the sum of all of its future dividend payments when discounted back to their present value.\n\nThe model gives a negative number when companies have a lower rate of return compared to the dividend growth rate. This may happen when a company continues to pay dividends even if it is incurring a loss or relatively lower earnings, as per Intel Case. This makes this model not good to be used alone when evaluating a business.\n\nKnowing this, the model is still used here, mainly because the final price tag is determined by the average of all the methods. This choice is made by the necessity of conservative estimates and cautious predictions. The discounted rating used here is the CAPM of 7.01%.\n\nThe model gives the following result:\n\n|Fair Value, taking in count a perpetual growth rate. Here we used the company growth rate of 18.26% and not the average growth rate of the dividends. This is due to the fact that the price given by the dividend growth is considered to be unrealistic for the next five years.|$-15.36|\n|:-|:-|\n|Fair Value assuming a zero growth in the dividends' growth. This price is not used to determine the final value due to the fact that the company has historically paid dividends with constant growth, and it is predicted to not stop this trend.|$24.62|\n\n&#x200B;\n\n## Total Payout Model\n\nIt is a variation of the DDF that takes in count shares repurchases. With 5.64 Billion paid in dividend in 2021, discount rate of 7.01% (CAPM) and growth rate of 18.26%, this model gives us a price tag of -**$12.22**\n\n## Final Fair Value\n\nThe Final price tag is determined as per following:\n\n|Free Cash Flow Evaluation Model|$23.57|\n|:-|:-|\n|Adjusted Graham Fair Value Formula|$97.53|\n|Discounted Unleveread Free Cash Flow Model|$56.67|\n|Dividend Discount Model|$-15.36|\n|Total Payout Model|\\-$12.22|\n|**Final Fair Price (Average)**|**$30.04**|\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Main Competitors\n\nIntel Corporation is in the Semiconductor\u2019s sector.\n\nAs the only leading-edge U.S. semiconductor company that **both develops and manufactures its own technology**, Intel has a widespread economic impact in every sector of the U.S. economy and a strategic advantage over its competitors. It is also the largest publicly traded semiconductor chipmaker in the United States.\n\nThe company is responsible for creating the x86 microprocessor, which is a part of nearly all personal computers today.\n\nDespite being a leader in its market, Intel operates in an area that has many players that compete for market share. Below are some of Intel's main competitors.\n\n|AMD - Advanced Micro Devices, like Intel, produces more than just microprocessors. Both companies create motherboards, servers, and other computer-related hardware. In terms of the x86 microprocessor, **AMD is Intel's biggest competitor.** Intel and AMD are rivals, much like Apple and Microsoft. They have certain specifications and dedicated users that will always stick to one over the other. Products from both companies are similar in price and quality. Though Intel's chips are primarily found in the computers of large companies, the competition between Intel and AMD comes down to individuals that build their own computers.|\n|:-|\n|IBM - International Business Machines is one of the first computer companies in the world, Founded in 1911, it was the pioneer in computer technology during the 20th century. The company developed the ATM, the hard disk, the floppy disk, the magnetic stripe, and many more. It is one of the 30 companies on the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) and one of the largest employers in the world. IBM used to produce computers using Intel's processors, but has since sold off that business and is now **selling its own servers and mainframes using its own processors, putting itself directly in competition with Intel.** The company launched a program to open source much of its architecture and firmware back in 2013, which attracted many new customers to using its Central Processing Units, stealing market share from Intel.|\n|NVIDIA - NVIDIA is one of the key players in the graphics processing unit (GPU) market. It is one of the **biggest names in video games**. It also designs **chips for mobile phones and automobiles**. Many of its chips are used in supercomputers, and it is now working on artificial intelligence. Intel released a new graphics card in the second half of 2021 that is competing directly with Nvidia's dominance in that field. It is used to compete in areas of data centre, artificial intelligence, and machine learning.|\n|Samsung - In 2018, it surpassed Intel as the largest semiconductor maker by revenue, but in 2019, Intel took that spot back. It's clear that both companies strive against one another for the top spot. Intel and Samsung don't compete in all fields, however. **Intel's products primarily focus on desktops and laptops, whereas Samsung focuses on semiconductors for smartphones and data centres.**|\n\n# The Products\n\n|**CGC \u2013 Client Computing Group** includes products designed for end-user form factors, focusing on higher growth segments of 2-in-1, thin and-light, commercial and gaming, and growing other products such as connectivity and graphics|\n|:-|\n|**NEX \u2013 Network and Edge Group** includes programmable platforms and high-performance connectivity and compute solutions designed for market segments such as cloud networking, communications networks, retail, industrial, healthcare, and vision.|\n|**DCAI \u2013 Datacenter and AI Group** includes a broad portfolio of CPUs, domain specific accelerators, FPGAs and memory, designed to empower datacenter and hyperscale solutions for diverse computing needs|\n|**AXG \u2013 Accelerated Computing System Graphics Group** includes CPUs for high performance computing (HPC) and GPUs targeted for a range of workloads and platforms from gaming and content creation to HPC and AI in the data centre|\n|**IFS \u2013 Intel Foundry Services** is a services provider offering a combination of leading-edge packaging and process technology, world-class differentiated internal IPs (i.e.: x86, graphics, AI), broad 3rd party ecosystem and silicon design support.|\n|**Mobileye** includes the development and deployment of advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and autonomous driving technologies and solutions.|\n\n# SWOT Analysis\n\n## Strengths\n\n* **Strong Industry position**: it has a strong market share in its major business segment. The main product is not easily copied.\n* **Economies of scale**: the microprocessor market i very large and Intel has a strong manufacturing plants\n* **Strong Research**: Intel\u2019s research team is highly professional, and made some breakthrough tech that cannot be copied by other manufacturers\n* **Strong partnership with Microsoft**: this partnership limits the market share growth of competitors\n* **Trustworthy raw material suppliers**: it has a solid base of reliable raw material suppliers\n* **Strong High-Tech culture**: its products are cutting edge innovations not easy to copy\n* **High Level of customer satisfaction**: It has a dedicated customer relation department that allows it to have a high level of customer satisfaction and brand recognition\n* **Strong Distribution Network**: It has developed a dependable distribution network that can reach the majority of its potential market\n* **High Free Cash Flow**: It has strong Free Cash Flow, which allows it to grow into new initiative and reinvest in the company\n* **Brand Recognition**: It has a strong brand recognition, positive perception of its products\n* **Social Media**: Intel invests in Social Media channel to reach its customers\n\n## Weaknesses\n\n* **High costs of goods**: It has high fixed costs which adversary affects profit margins\n* **High level of debt**: It has a lot of debt, which increases the interest costs on funds borrowed to finance activities.\n* **Declining PC sales**: the PC market is shrinking due to post Covid open up and cycle of the business\n* **High Dependency on the Main Segment**: Intel has a strong dependency on PC sales\n* **Limited Business Diversification**: Intel is facing challenges in diversifying. It is trying to enter the mobile phone, tablet and TV segments.\n* **Limited Customer Care in Developing Countries**: the company\u2019s customer care is less active in developing countries, missing new potential customers\n* **Weak R&D**: the company research and development division as a small investment compared to its revenue\n\n## Opportunities\n\n* **High Growth**: its products are expected to be in high demand in the next growth cycle\n* **Increase in Demand:** expected increase in demands for personal computers and servers\n* **Automatic Cars**: this market requires high-tech processors\n* **Drones**: their usage is growing year after year and is a great opportunity for Intel\n* **Developing Countries**: are expected to grow and are an opportunity to acquire new customers and partners\n* **Defence sector:** institutional contractors might demand Intel high-tech processors for strategic tech and services\n\n## Treats\n\n* **Competition**: Intel is a leading leader in its industry and is facing high pressure from competitors such as: AMD, NVIDIA, Qualcomm, Samsung\n* **Competitors\u2019 New product launches**:Competitors products are threatening Intel leadership\n* **Price sensitivity**: semiconductor market is a highly price sensitive market and cheaper products from competitors might drastically eat away Intel\u2019s market share\n* **Fluctuating PC sales**: Intel is too dependent on this segment\n* **Harmful regulations**: the company is facing harmful regulations from countries that are trying to erode the sale of Intel\u2019s products\n* **Geopolitical Events**: Semiconductors is a strategic industry for many countries and international political events might impact the company\n* **Reliance on third party manufacturers**: Intel and Manufacturers are highly dependent from each others\n\n# Financials\n\n## Income Statement\n\nIn the past three years the average increase in revenue has gone up by 0.10% showing a stagnation of sales with the growth from 2020 to 2021 being 0.47%. While having an average increase in operating expense of 2.14% with the last year increase, from 2020 to 2021, of 10.12% showing a spike in costs for the last operating period.\n\nIt is expected for the year 2022 to have both Costs and Revenue increase by approximately 18%\n\nA point of some concern might be the small decrease in net revenue in those past 4 years, confirming a stagnation of the business.\n\n## Balance Sheet\n\nThe 2021 balance sheet shows us\n\n* Short term debt of 4.59 Billion coverable by cash and cash equivalents plus account receivables, but not only by C&C alone\n* Long term debt is coverable by current assets alone\n* Increased stockholders equity, earnings are being retained in the company and reinvested\n\n## Cash Flows\n\nIntel has positive Cash Flow from Operations in the last four years. Same thing for Net Cash Flow. A reduction of both can be observed for the last year.\n\nThe Company has an Income Quality ratio of 1.51, which is good and signals a healthy income.\n\nINTC is investing heavily in PP&E\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTO SEE RATIOS ETC LOOK AT THE PDF [HERE](https://we.tl/t-GsEKQyPULM)\n\n# Revenue Forecast\n\nWith the release of the new Intel Arc 7, with has the potential and capability to rival and surpass its competitors, NVIDIA and AMD, and a increase in demand for the year 2023, it is forecasted a growth in revenue according to the growth rate calculated of 18.26%\n\n## Analysts Price Target\n\n**$52 High**\n\n**$34 Average**\n\n**$18 Low**\n\n**$30 Author\u2019s**\n\nTO SEE OTHER PARTS CHECK OUT THE PDF REPORT [HERE](https://we.tl/t-GsEKQyPULM), I CAN UPLOAD PICS THAT IS WHY IT IS BETTER TO READ IT FROM THE MAIN PAPER\n\n# Final Considerations\n\n## What is its position compared to competitors?\n\nBy observing the industry and taking in count different factors such as geopolitical and market demands for electronics, we can forecast a possible development for Intel.\n\nINTC has a strong customer base and it is known worldwide for its contributions and development of cutting hedge technologies, this is well resonated especially in developing countries such as India, China, Nigeria and Indonesia.\n\nWhile its North American market share in Graphics and Motherboards got eroded by some percentage by its main competitor AMD, it still maintain a leadership position in the sector. We shall note that Intel operates in sectors which permit it to diversify a little bit its product\u2019s portfolio, where AMD doesn\u2019t have expertise nor is capable to compete.\n\nWith high inflation and interest rate corroding the whole market, it is expected to meet some possible downturn for the near period of time (3 to 6 months) and stabilise within a year while the FED is fighting the raising of costs. The company has strong fundamentals that shields it from possible adverse events in the near future and its cash flow quality is high.\n\nIntel Corporation is currently undervalued due to North American Market downtrend perception of it due to the rival\u2019s marketing attacks. It is also reasonable that the past CEO brought the company into stagnation and slowdown, but with the new one, with his expertise and experience, we can expect a turnaround and regain of some market share in the next few years.\n\nWith US Government subsidies for the semiconductor industry, we can see a deep strategic interest in bringing and boosting domestic productions and reducing potential risk from over relying on taiwanese manufacturers. This incentivised Intel to invest in two new fabs, one in Ohio and one in Arizona, plans to expand existing plants are already funded and another European production site is planned in Germany.\n\nSWOT analysis shows us many strong moats for the business, which are its competitive advantages over competitors. Huge potentials can be exploited if the company decided to pursue an expansion strategy into developing countries and markets.\n\nLack of insiders sell, which the last one in february 2022, shows us that the management is confident in the company's future development, which is confirmed by additional buying from the CEO itself in the last months. Big Institutions and Mutual Funds hold portions of the company too, signalling strong sentimento towards the company. Employees rating and satisfaction rate is high, salaries aren't that much different from rivals.\n\n## Is the company a Buy or a Sell?\n\nThe company is distributing regular dividends, it has strong fundamentals and lots of cash to meet adverse events. Institutions and insiders are holding. The current downtrend is due to market trend and social mechanism, of which contributed AMD marketing in damaging Intel\u2019s perception in the CPU segment.\n\nFundamentally though, the company has many potentials and growth opportunities, especially now with its new release Intel Arc 7.\n\nIntel is a smart investment for long term holders, not only because its intrinsic value is expected to grow, but also for the fact that it pays high dividend\u2019s yield. If the company was in a severe situation, it still can retain earnings to cover expenses, even if it is unlikely due to its present liquidity.\n\nIn the end, the verdict is one: **Buy. Fair Value is $30.**\n\n**What are you thoughts? Is Intel a Buy or a Sell? Let us all know!**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***This is not a financial advice.***",

Those changes are due to its recent management team, which stagnated the company and slowed it with bad management decisions. With the new CEO Pat Gelsinger and his expertise, direct experience and know-how in the sector, the company is moving out from its slowdown and trying to catch up with its main rivals.\n\n## Purpose\n\nThe purpose of this thesis is to analyze the development of Intel Corporation (INTC) during the past four years, from 2018 to 2021 and forecast its activity for the next five years. Not only are the financial statements taken into consideration but also macroeconomics factors and its main competitor Advanced Micro Device (AMD).\n\nAll is made to answer the following questions:\n\n* What is its position compared to competitors?\n* Is the company a Buy or a Sell?\n\n## Hypothesis\n\n* INTC is not a dying company\n* INTC downtrend is following the sector and the market movement\n* INTC is a cyclical business, and we are in a down cycle\n* INTC investments will boost its revenues in the next five years\n* USA government will not allow one of its pivotal and strategic company to fail\n* INTC will face more stress as AMD is eating market share\n* INTC\u2019s new products are the top-notch of the sector\n\n# Methodology\n\nWhen the authors initially wrote this thesis, the intention was not to take the position of an expert in company valuation. Instead, their aim was to investigate the development of a company based upon information and knowledge obtained from previous education and studies. Moreover, the underlying company for this valuation is Intel Corporation, since the authors aim to analyse a well reputable company with a strong market brand in a highly competitive market.\n\n## Secondary Data\n\nSecondary data is the information that doesn\u2019t require a direct collection or studies, this information is publicly available online for the public to be consulted.

It is also the largest publicly traded semiconductor chipmaker in the United States.\n\nThe company is responsible for creating the x86 microprocessor, which is a part of nearly all personal computers today.\n\nDespite being a leader in its market, Intel operates in an area that has many players that compete for market share. Below are some of Intel's main competitors.\n\n|AMD - Advanced Micro Devices, like Intel, produces more than just microprocessors. Both companies create motherboards, servers, and other computer-related hardware. In terms of the x86 microprocessor, **AMD is Intel's biggest competitor.** Intel and AMD are rivals, much like Apple and Microsoft. They have certain specifications and dedicated users that will always stick to one over the other. Products from both companies are similar in price and quality. Though Intel's chips are primarily found in the computers of large companies, the competition between Intel and AMD comes down to individuals that build their own computers.|\n|:-|\n|IBM - International Business Machines is one of the first computer companies in the world, Founded in 1911, it was the pioneer in computer technology during the 20th century. The company developed the ATM, the hard disk, the floppy disk, the magnetic stripe, and many more. It is one of the 30 companies on the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) and one of the largest employers in the world. IBM used to produce computers using Intel's processors, but has since sold off that business and is now **selling its own servers and mainframes using its own processors, putting itself directly in competition with Intel.** The company launched a program to open source much of its architecture and firmware back in 2013, which attracted many new customers to using its Central Processing Units, stealing market share from Intel.|\n|NVIDIA - NVIDIA is one of the key players in the graphics processing unit (GPU) market. It is one of the **biggest names in video games**. It also designs **chips for mobile phones and automobiles**. Many of its chips are used in supercomputers, and it is now working on artificial intelligence. Intel released a new graphics card in the second half of 2021 that is competing directly with Nvidia's dominance in that field. It is used to compete in areas of data centre, artificial intelligence, and machine learning.|\n|Samsung - In 2018, it surpassed Intel as the largest semiconductor maker by revenue, but in 2019, Intel took that spot back. It's clear that both companies strive against one another for the top spot. Intel and Samsung don't compete in all fields, however. **Intel's products primarily focus on desktops and laptops, whereas Samsung focuses on semiconductors for smartphones and data centres.**|\n\n# The Products\n\n|**CGC \u2013 Client Computing Group** includes products designed for end-user form factors, focusing on higher growth segments of 2-in-1, thin and-light, commercial and gaming, and growing other products such as connectivity and graphics|\n|:-|\n|**NEX \u2013 Network and Edge Group** includes programmable platforms and high-performance connectivity and compute solutions designed for market segments such as cloud networking, communications networks, retail, industrial, healthcare, and vision.|\n|**DCAI \u2013 Datacenter and AI Group** includes a broad portfolio of CPUs, domain specific accelerators, FPGAs and memory, designed to empower datacenter and hyperscale solutions for diverse computing needs|\n|**AXG \u2013 Accelerated Computing System Graphics Group** includes CPUs for high performance computing (HPC) and GPUs targeted for a range of workloads and platforms from gaming and content creation to HPC and AI in the data centre|\n|**IFS \u2013 Intel Foundry Services** is a services provider offering a combination of leading-edge packaging and process technology, world-class differentiated internal IPs (i.e.: x86, graphics, AI), broad 3rd party ecosystem and silicon design support.|\n|**Mobileye** includes the development and deployment of advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and autonomous driving technologies and solutions.|\n\n# SWOT Analysis\n\n## Strengths\n\n* **Strong Industry position**: it has a strong market share in its major business segment. The main product is not easily copied.\n* **Economies of scale**: the microprocessor market i very large and Intel has a strong manufacturing plants\n* **Strong Research**: Intel\u2019s research team is highly professional, and made some breakthrough tech that cannot be copied by other manufacturers\n* **Strong partnership with Microsoft**: this partnership limits the market share growth of competitors\n* **Trustworthy raw material suppliers**: it has a solid base of reliable raw material suppliers\n* **Strong High-Tech culture**: its products are cutting edge innovations not easy to copy\n* **High Level of customer satisfaction**: It has a dedicated customer relation department that allows it to have a high level of customer satisfaction and brand recognition\n* **Strong Distribution Network**: It has developed a dependable distribution network that can reach the majority of its potential market\n* **High Free Cash Flow**: It has strong Free Cash Flow, which allows it to grow into new initiative and reinvest in the company\n* **Brand Recognition**: It has a strong brand recognition, positive perception of its products\n* **Social Media**: Intel invests in Social Media channel to reach its customers\n\n## Weaknesses\n\n* **High costs of goods**: It has high fixed costs which adversary affects profit margins\n* **High level of debt**: It has a lot of debt, which increases the interest costs on funds borrowed to finance activities.\n* **Declining PC sales**: the PC market is shrinking due to post Covid open up and cycle of the business\n* **High Dependency on the Main Segment**: Intel has a strong dependency on PC sales\n* **Limited Business Diversification**: Intel is facing challenges in diversifying. It is trying to enter the mobile phone, tablet and TV segments.\n* **Limited Customer Care in Developing Countries**: the company\u2019s customer care is less active in developing countries, missing new potential customers\n* **Weak R&D**: the company research and development division as a small investment compared to its revenue\n\n## Opportunities\n\n* **High Growth**: its products are expected to be in high demand in the next growth cycle\n* **Increase in Demand:** expected increase in demands for personal computers and servers\n* **Automatic Cars**: this market requires high-tech processors\n* **Drones**: their usage is growing year after year and is a great opportunity for Intel\n* **Developing Countries**: are expected to grow and are an opportunity to acquire new customers and partners\n* **Defence sector:** institutional contractors might demand Intel high-tech processors for strategic tech and services\n\n## Treats\n\n* **Competition**: Intel is a leading leader in its industry and is facing high pressure from competitors such as: AMD, NVIDIA, Qualcomm, Samsung\n* **Competitors\u2019 New product launches**:Competitors products are threatening Intel leadership\n* **Price sensitivity**: semiconductor market is a highly price sensitive market and cheaper products from competitors might drastically eat away Intel\u2019s market share\n* **Fluctuating PC sales**: Intel is too dependent on this segment\n* **Harmful regulations**: the company is facing harmful regulations from countries that are trying to erode the sale of Intel\u2019s products\n* **Geopolitical Events**: Semiconductors is a strategic industry for many countries and international political events might impact the company\n* **Reliance on third party manufacturers**: Intel and Manufacturers are highly dependent from each others\n\n# Financials\n\n## Income Statement\n\nIn the past three years the average increase in revenue has gone up by 0.10% showing a stagnation of sales with the growth from 2020 to 2021 being 0.47%. While having an average increase in operating expense of 2.14% with the last year increase, from 2020 to 2021, of 10.12% showing a spike in costs for the last operating period.\n\nIt is expected for the year 2022 to have both Costs and Revenue increase by approximately 18%\n\nA point of some concern might be the small decrease in net revenue in those past 4 years, confirming a stagnation of the business.\n\n## Balance Sheet\n\nThe 2021 balance sheet shows us\n\n* Short term debt of 4.59 Billion coverable by cash and cash equivalents plus account receivables, but not only by C&C alone\n* Long term debt is coverable by current assets alone\n* Increased stockholders equity, earnings are being retained in the company and reinvested\n\n## Cash Flows\n\nIntel has positive Cash Flow from Operations in the last four years. Same thing for Net Cash Flow. A reduction of both can be observed for the last year.\n\nThe Company has an Income Quality ratio of 1.51, which is good and signals a healthy income.\n\nINTC is investing heavily in PP&E\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTO SEE RATIOS ETC LOOK AT THE PDF [HERE](https://we.tl/t-GsEKQyPULM)\n\n# Revenue Forecast\n\nWith the release of the new Intel Arc 7, with has the potential and capability to rival and surpass its competitors, NVIDIA and AMD, and a increase in demand for the year 2023, it is forecasted a growth in revenue according to the growth rate calculated of 18.26%\n\n## Analysts Price Target\n\n**$52 High**\n\n**$34 Average**\n\n**$18 Low**\n\n**$30 Author\u2019s**\n\nTO SEE OTHER PARTS CHECK OUT THE PDF REPORT [HERE](https://we.tl/t-GsEKQyPULM), I CAN UPLOAD PICS THAT IS WHY IT IS BETTER TO READ IT FROM THE MAIN PAPER\n\n# Final Considerations\n\n## What is its position compared to competitors?\n\nBy observing the industry and taking in count different factors such as geopolitical and market demands for electronics, we can forecast a possible development for Intel.\n\nINTC has a strong customer base and it is known worldwide for its contributions and development of cutting hedge technologies, this is well resonated especially in developing countries such as India, China, Nigeria and Indonesia.\n\nWhile its North American market share in Graphics and Motherboards got eroded by some percentage by its main competitor AMD, it still maintain a leadership position in the sector. We shall note that Intel operates in sectors which permit it to diversify a little bit its product\u2019s portfolio, where AMD doesn\u2019t have expertise nor is capable to compete.\n\nWith high inflation and interest rate corroding the whole market, it is expected to meet some possible downturn for the near period of time (3 to 6 months) and stabilise within a year while the FED is fighting the raising of costs. The company has strong fundamentals that shields it from possible adverse events in the near future and its cash flow quality is high.\n\nIntel Corporation is currently undervalued due to North American Market downtrend perception of it due to the rival\u2019s marketing attacks. It is also reasonable that the past CEO brought the company into stagnation and slowdown, but with the new one, with his expertise and experience, we can expect a turnaround and regain of some market share in the next few years.\n\nWith US Government subsidies for the semiconductor industry, we can see a deep strategic interest in bringing and boosting domestic productions and reducing potential risk from over relying on taiwanese manufacturers. This incentivised Intel to invest in two new fabs, one in Ohio and one in Arizona, plans to expand existing plants are already funded and another European production site is planned in Germany.\n\nSWOT analysis shows us many strong moats for the business, which are its competitive advantages over competitors. Huge potentials can be exploited if the company decided to pursue an expansion strategy into developing countries and markets.\n\nLack of insiders sell, which the last one in february 2022, shows us that the management is confident in the company's future development, which is confirmed by additional buying from the CEO itself in the last months. Big Institutions and Mutual Funds hold portions of the company too, signalling strong sentimento towards the company. Employees rating and satisfaction rate is high, salaries aren't that much different from rivals.\n\n## Is the company a Buy or a Sell?\n\nThe company is distributing regular dividends, it has strong fundamentals and lots of cash to meet adverse events. Institutions and insiders are holding. The current downtrend is due to market trend and social mechanism, of which contributed AMD marketing in damaging Intel\u2019s perception in the CPU segment.\n\nFundamentally though, the company has many potentials and growth opportunities, especially now with its new release Intel Arc 7.\n\nIntel is a smart investment for long term holders, not only because its intrinsic value is expected to grow, but also for the fact that it pays high dividend\u2019s yield. If the company was in a severe situation, it still can retain earnings to cover expenses, even if it is unlikely due to its present liquidity.\n\nIn the end, the verdict is one: **Buy. Fair Value is $30.**\n\n**What are you thoughts? Is Intel a Buy or a Sell? Let us all know!**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***This is not a financial advice.***",

The growth rate of 0.71% is used in every valuation methods used. Note: Analysts growth rate for the next 5 years for Intel is: -0.16%\n* To better calculate the growth rate, i need the percentage of earnings that are not distributed to investors. I calculated the retained one as 71.59% and the distributed portion of 28.41%. I am not sure if this is correct, thus i assumed a retention rate of 5% to be conservative, if you have some indication please do not restrain yourself thanks!\n* In the Dividend Discount Model, i used the calculated company growth rate of **0.71%** and not the average of the last 9 years of 5.64%. This is due to the fact that i see it as an unreasonable growth rate for dividend for the next near future. This model is based of Gordon's Growth Model (with constant growth in dividend).\n* **As Discount Rate, i used mainly CAPM** form most of the evaluation methods, even tho i calculated WACC, i used it only for the Total Payment Valuation Method.\n* **I made also a Risk Analysis**, but i think it is fucked up, and thus it shall not be considered at all and skipped lol\n* **Company has a cash burn rate of 0.50** and 6 months remaing, i dont know why, it seems odd not gonna lie but i still have to figure out what is wrong.

Some said that Cash & Cash equivalents is around 50B, but in the balance sheet i see only the Total Current Assets around that number. This gives us a price of $38.98|\n|**Discounted Unlevelead Free Cash Flow**|This model observe past Unlevered Free Cash Flow and Forecast the growth of it for the next 5 years. Growth rate is a conservative 0.71% putting Fair Value Price for the next year to $19.22. Note that the future is unpredictable and this model shall use different growth rate for each year forecasted. The value is calculated assuming that the current market condition persists for the next 5 years.|\n|**Dividend Discount Model**|This model observes the historical variation of Yearly Dividends. It is based on the principle that a Company Value is due to the Present Value of all its future dividends. Gordon's Growth Model is the DDM assuming a constant growth of the dividend and this DDM is based on that assumption. The fact that 5% growth is not sustainable in current market condition, i sued the calculated growth rate that i made, 0.71%, giving us a Value of $24.09 assuming a constant growth of dividend by that rate. This is conservative estimate.|\n|**Total Payout Valuation Model**|This method is an alternative to DDM and try to extrapolate the Fair Value from its dividend payout. This method is the only one where i used WACC as discount rate.

I can's comment on management cause i still have to check it. Short Term and Long Term Debts are increasing, surely due to this year shenanigans in the overall market.

    "selftext": "So AMD just dropped off a cliff today after issuing lower guidance on their upcoming earnings. This prompted me to look at Intel and I noticed they are trading at 5x their earnings and their price to book is near 1. New CEO is turning the company around and it's trading pretty much at value, with a 5% dividend yield on top. CHIPS act is about to give them huge subsidies to rebuild supply chains. Are we buying? \n\nI'm thinking a deep ITM LEAPS that I can PMCC all the way through market recovery",

Lots of analysts lowering estimates and forecasts, but they are still being absolutely irrational. Q3 isn't the bottom for these earnings, its just the beginning as employment hasn't even meaningfully dropped yet. All signs point to inflation having peaked, but if you paid attention to the White House's reaction to the OPEC production cut, you can tell they are very worried that energy prices will again push on inflation once the releases from the SPR end. \n\nCommon themes across these early poor reporters seems to be a glut of inventory, a quickly deteriorating consumer, as well as extreme FX issues due to the too strong US dollar. Fedex is also a canary in the coal mine for all things ecommerce as well. Again, all this has occurred in Q3 and we haven't even seen unemployment make a meaningful rise. The Fed will absolutely not pivot anytime soon as inflation has yet to meaningfully fall (SPR releases mess with the number). If something breaks and the Fed is forced to lower rates, inflation is going to murder the economy. \n\nP.S. **AMD** has also joined the party!",

    "selftext": "Companies like Intel, AMD, and Nvidia have all dropped quite a bit since the start of the year, and it's unlikely that they will see any rise anytime soon. I know that we are in a recession and that we still have a chip shortage, but it seems like most of these companies have a solid roadmap on how to navigate these next few years. Tech is constantly evolving, and I'm excited for the results of some of the projects these companies are working on behind the scenes. Also, I'm aware that the stock price of these companies can drop even further but I will just buy the dip. \n\nJust wanted to see if anyone here thinks now is not the time to invest in this industry, or is avoiding it altogether.",
