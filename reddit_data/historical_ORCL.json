    "title": "DD on $BITF - A Speculative, But Undervalued Company with the Potential to be the Next Big AI/HPC Infrastructure Play",
    "selftext": "Hello fellow regards,\n\nI am writing to you to inform you on the next best degen ticker for the most restarted regards. No financial advice here buddy, invest at your own risk.\u00a0\n\nBefore we get into Bitfarms (1W +70%, \\~$1bn Market Cap) it is important to get some context on the current AI Infrastructure landscape.\n\n* Nebius just struck a $17.4b deal, potentially rising up to $19.4b, with Microsoft to provide dedicated AI infrastructure over the next 5 years. Nebius rose 40% over the last week. Additionally, Q2 Revenue is up 106% quarter over quarter.\n* CoreWeave, not my favorite play, but has $30.1b in revenue backlog and contracts with Microsoft, OpenAI, Mistral, and others. CRWV is up 187% since their IPO in March.\n* Oracle has signed a $300b deal with OpenAI. Q2 cloud infra revenue is up 52% year over year. Oracle rose 38% over the last week.\n\nThis is just the start. There isn\u2019t enough compute to go around, hence the high revenue backlog and exorbitant amounts of CapEx spending.\n\nNow, where does BITF come in? This is supposedly just a BTC mining company. They have a proven capability of running profitable BTC mining data centers \u2013 their direct cost per BTC is $48.2k while their revenue per BTC is $98k (an almost 50% margin per BTC).\n\nI want to start by introducing the key risks before getting to my main investment thesis:\n\n* What BITF don\u2019t have currently is commited contracts/backlogs.\n* Additionally, there is an execution risk (obtaining power, permits, building cooling, fiber, ensuring reliability, acquiring GPUs or equivalent hardware, hiring skilled staff).\n* BITF has diluted shares in the past, but has completed a 4.9m+ share buy back.\n\nSo, I want to be clear, this is a speculative play for the most restarted regards. However, I do believe these risks will all be addressed.\n\nNow moving on to my bulll thesis:\n\nThey have demonstrated a clear willingness to shift their focus towards AI/HPC infrastructure. I introduce the Panther Creek data center campus in Pennsylvania.\u00a0\n\n* Pennsylvania is well known to be a haven for data center development. They are home to the PJM Interconnection (covers electricity market for 13 US states), so huge amounts of power at competitive pricing. Pennsylvania also generates tons of natural gas, nuclear and coal. In essence, PA offers abundant, low-cost energy, existing transmission, and favorable permitting as well.\n* The Panther Creek DC is expected to have between 350 \u2013 410 MW with full capacity expected to be reach by 2027.\n* T5 Data Centers is responsible for the buildout. This is a well reputed company in this space with 3 GW+ managed, 100% uptime since 2012, and 50+ data centers supported. \u00a0\n* In addition, they have secured additional prime data center land (Bitfarms Moses Lake Site) in Washington located in the largest data center cluster on the West Coast.\n* Another key point is they have significant access to financing ($230m in total liquidity) to make this high CapEx spend a reality. $8m in monthly FCF generation \u2013 this is almost $100m yearly and equivalent to almost a third of revenue.. Furthermore, they have secured $300m in debt from Macquarie (a bank focused on infrastructure finance). Also, they have their future non-core business of BTC mining to support CapEx spending.\n* It is a value play \u2013 yes, you heard me right. Yes, this stock also went up 70% over the past week. But BITF presents signifcantly lower multiples than comparable peers.\n   * BITF with 2.9x TEV/Revenue LTM compared to CLSK (6.33x), CRWV (23.59x), IREN (8.65x)\n   * TEV/Revenue NTM (next 12 months) at 1.65x for BITF compared to CLSK (3.31x), CRWV (9.95x), and IREN (3.36x)\n\nCan BITF 10x? Yes, it can. Can BITF go to bag-holder land? Yes, it can. Invest at your own risk.\n\nHave fun\n\nRegards,\n\nchecazzo\n\nSources: BITF (Q2 Presentation), NBIS (Q2 Presentation), NBIS (MSFT Press Release), CRWV (Q2 Presentation), ORCL (Q2 Press Release), Capital IQ (Multiples)\n\n\n\nScreenshot of Position Below:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bd8h4129knof1.png?width=1622&format=png&auto=webp&s=8230c6388fc11df54a1984cb9aba91581676e1b0",

Apple, Nvidia, Microsoft, Meta, Google, Amazon...\n\nThere are a handful of companies on the entire planet which that describes, and they can build their own stuff. Why, for example, would Meta or Amazon give Oracle $50B just to build a data center that doesn't even exist yet anyway?\n\nIt's one thing to buy infrastructure that already exists and that you want right now, it's another thing to order infrastructure that doesn't even exist when you already know how to build your own.\n\nThe whole cloud revenue/order backlog thing looks like bullshit to me. It's going to grow $144B in cloud revenue in 5 years? Uh, I don't see Google, Microsoft, or Amazon doubling cloud revenue every year, so how the fuck is Oracle?\n\n",

As the holiday season approaches, technology procurement leaders at major enterprises are busy prioritizing their technology spending plans for 2025. These budget adjustments could signal potential changes in market share and spending direction.\n\n\n\nWhile OpenAI and Microsoft are getting a lot of attention in the AI space, a new CIO (chief information officer) survey shows that Alphabet (GOOGL.O) is rapidly coming into its own in the enterprise AI spending race.\n\n\n\nPiper Sandler's 2025 CIO Survey, which was released over the weekend, interviewed 81 CIOs about their budget priorities for different vendors and technology areas.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe tech industry will be dynamic in 2025,\u201d Piper Sandler's analyst team writes, \u201dwith generative AI transitioning from the testing/planning phase to implementation and driving growth in cloud spending.\u201d\n\n\n\nAnalysts noted that 87 percent of CIOs expect their IT budgets to increase in 2025, the highest percentage since the survey began in 2020.\n\n\n\nThe popularity of Google Cloud increased significantly compared to the previous two surveys. In the \u201cmost strategic\u201d AI vendor category, Google Cloud received 27 percent support, up from 15 percent six months ago. Meanwhile, Microsoft, the former leader, saw its support drop from 33% to 24%.\n\n\n\nGoogle Cloud also topped the ranking of AI infrastructure providers. When asked which cloud company they plan to test or implement AI projects with next year, 50 percent of respondents chose Google Cloud.\n\n\n\nOverall, this is good news for the major cloud infrastructure providers.The uptick in interest in AI applications and projects has led to higher spending intentions than six months ago for all providers, including Microsoft Azure, Amazon AWS, Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI).\n\n\n\nThe trend has been equally favorable to the parent companies of these cloud companies - Microsoft, Amazon (AMZN.O), Alphabet and Oracle (ORCL.N).\n\n\n\nIt's also a big plus for NVIDIA (NVDA.O), according to Harsh Kumar, a semiconductor analyst at Piper.\n\n\n\nAll cloud companies are big customers of NVIDIA's AI chips. NVIDIA holds more than 70 percent of the AI GPU (graphics processing unit) market, according to analysts.Kumar expects the AI chip market to exceed $500 billion by 2028.\n\n\n\nIf CIOs' budget plans come to fruition, 2025 will be a major growth year for AI. Investors are already picking up on the trend, with Alphabet's shares having risen nearly 15 percent this month.\n\nPersonally, I think the short-term risk is high and the better strategy in the long run is to buy low\n\n",

    "selftext": "Elon Musk's net worth is estimated to have grown by tens of billions of dollars on Thursday, when Tesla ( TSLA ) shares hit their highest price ever. With Friday's trading volatility, his wealth is expected to increase even further.\n\nOn Thursday, Tesla reported mixed earnings, but the results were encouraging, with investors focusing on several factors including strong margins, earnings per share, net income, and the company's lowest-ever cost per item sold. This was Tesla's first earnings growth in seven quarters.\n\nMuch of this growth may also be attributed to Musk's new round of promises.\n\nHe predicted that Tesla will start offering carpooling in at least two states next year (California and Texas), where he plans to get approval from \u201cfully unsupervised\u201d Fully Self-Driving (FSD) regulators. Musk also revealed his \u201cbest guess\u201d for 2025 deliveries, which he said will increase by 20 to 30 percent, as Tesla plans to start selling more affordable models in early 2024. Tesla plans to sell more than 1.81 million electric vehicles in 2024.\n\nIn an earnings call with analysts, Musk said, \u201cI predict Tesla will be the most valuable company in the world, and probably by a long shot.\u201d\n\nMusk controls nearly 13 percent of Tesla's outstanding shares, but could buy more at a steep discount if his compensation plan is approved by the courts. He also owns a majority stake in SpaceX, which he leads, as well as artificial intelligence startup xAI and social media platform X (META) (formerly Twitter).\n\nTesla's gains on Thursday boosted Musk's net worth to about $270 billion, up $33.5 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. The index is updated at the close of the New York market. The Forbes Real-Time Billionaires Index is expected to grow by $26 billion on Thursday to about $269 billion. Musk's net worth increased by another $3 billion to nearly $273 billion as of Friday, Forbes reported.\n\nThe second-richest person on the list is Oracle Corporation ( ORCL ) founder and Musk ally Larry Ellison, with a net worth of $213.8 billion, according to Forbes. He was followed by Amazon (AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, with $207.7 billion and $200.5 billion, respectively.\n\nTesla shares were up more than 2 percent in regular trading Friday morning at about $266 a share, up 55 percent in the past six months. The stock is up just 6 percent so far this year.",

    "selftext": "Today's GTC may have been challenging for many to grasp, but that's actually a positive indicator. This isn't a trivial matter\u2014it marks a significant leap in technological advancement, arguably the most groundbreaking achievement humanity has ever witnessed.\n\nLet's delve into the details. Training large language models has become a focal point for companies like $AMZN, $META, and $NOW. The previous generation of chips, exemplified by the Grace Hopper Superchip, was undoubtedly impressive. However, Blackwell surpasses it by a staggering margin\u2014it's 30 times faster and more powerful. This technological leap places the competition even further behind, effectively setting them back by another decade.\n\nAn often-overlooked aspect is the indispensability of Blackwell for cloud service providers (CSPs). The sheer scale of the task\u2014training the Large Language Model (LLM) with previous technology\u2014highlights the monumental significance of Blackwell. Simply put, there's no viable alternative, and this sets a new benchmark, reminiscent of the \"Steve Jobs\" era where innovation reigned supreme.\n\nFinancially speaking, Blackwell comes at a premium, and demand is already sky-high among major corporations globally. The price tag significantly exceeds that of its predecessor, the H100, but the value proposition is clear. NVIDIA's transition into a software company is a strategic move that ensures recurring revenue for each chip sold, providing a substantial margin and solidifying CUDA as the preferred software platform for developers.\n\nThe impact extends beyond finances to areas like robotics and AI, promising to revolutionize industries such as manufacturing, transportation, surgical procedures, and humanoid robotics. This comprehensive suite of hardware and software products, coupled with licensing and SAAS offerings, underscores the breadth of NVIDIA's reach.\n\nIndustrial companies are rushing to explore the possibilities offered by NVIDIA, recognizing that joining forces with NVIDIA can drive down their Total Cost of Operations (TCO). This aspect, often overlooked, is the true differentiator for NVIDIA\u2014a connective tissue that permeates every segment and underpins its unparalleled value proposition.\n\nUnderstanding the concept of Total Cost of Operations (TCO) is crucial, especially for industrial players. NVIDIA's ability to swiftly identify efficiencies and resolve issues in warehouses or factories highlights its immense value. For CSPs like AMZN, MSFT, GOOGL, ORCL, the significance of TCO cannot be overstated. Regardless of the investment required for NVIDIA chips and the accompanying recurring revenue, it's still a more cost-effective solution compared to alternatives\u2014because time is of the essence, and waiting for a thousand years simply isn't an option.\n\n In conclusion, NVIDIA's Blackwell chip marks a transformative moment in technology, redefining industry standards and solidifying NVIDIA's position as a leader in AI and computing. Its impact extends across various sectors, promising not just technological advancements but also significant financial gains for both NVIDIA and its partners. As Blackwell becomes increasingly integrated into critical systems and processes, its influence on innovation and efficiency is set to shape the future landscape of technology and business. \n\n TL;DR:\n\n* NVIDIA's Blackwell chip represents a monumental leap in technology, surpassing previous advancements by a significant margin.\n* Cloud service providers (CSPs) are heavily reliant on Blackwell for training large language models, setting a new standard in the industry.\n* Financially, Blackwell commands a premium but promises substantial recurring revenue and solidifies CUDA as a preferred software platform.\n* Beyond finances, Blackwell's impact extends to robotics, AI, manufacturing, transportation, and more.\n* Industrial companies recognize the potential to reduce Total Cost of Operations (TCO) by leveraging NVIDIA's technology.\n* Understanding TCO is crucial, as NVIDIA's efficiency and effectiveness offer unparalleled value compared to alternatives, making it a game-changer in various industries.",

Planning to get rid of NVDA calls after GTC if there is a high jump in the stock and it reaches 975-1000 level. For TSM, not sure if I am holding until earnings or selling before, I'll see based on how the stock moves. They should have their March earnings report come out too so that could be a good catalyst if it is good. Might lose some money of 200/220 4/19c's but those were bought just to have more shares to control for cheaper never meant to be held until expiration. \n\nAlong with these, I also jumped on the MSTR hype train with the short squeeze going on and the stock growing parabolic due to HF's having to buying the stock back to cut their losses. Was planning to sell this before the weekend to avoid theta, was 1k up on the call too but did not have my device to sell it so couldnt go thru with it. Planning to get out of it this week if MSTR does really good, else might try to breakeven if not.\n\nI also got some ORCL calls for their earnings. Since they were far OTM they got IV crushed. I was up 1k on them at one point but decided to hold for the NVDA conference due to their \"exciting partnership with NVDA in upcoming week\" announcement. Will sell the 140c's if the stock goes high due to the announcement, might get rid of most of 150c's too but will hold onto 160c's I think.\n\nWhat do you guys think, this yolo is gonna work?

    "selftext": "We know the market runs on psychological levels. AMD retesting $100? You can bet that a bunch of highly regarded degens are slinging fat bids to get in at that $100 psych level. We love nice, round numbers, and it's pretty obvious that most stocks treat big psych levels (i.e. multiples of 50, 100, etc) as important support/resistance levels.\n\nNow combine stocks trading at big psych levels with OTM options, and you're now looking at 10-100x+ potential returns. Examples to understand how:\n\n# Example 1: ORCL vs $100: 15x \ud83d\ude0e\n\nORCL had earnings last week (December 11th). Post earnings it sold off to - you guessed it - the $100 psych level! $100 has been key for ORCL since 2021.\n\n[ORCL vs $100 over the past few trading days. After post ER dump, it found $100 to base off of. Quickly made a move from $100 -\\> $105](https://preview.redd.it/fb8qyovj9q7c1.png?width=3144&format=png&auto=webp&s=fbb7d804065c4e146fbcc89491e503aefa7425b3)\n\n[ORCL 12\\/22 $105c chart \\(post ER\\). Small change in underlying -\\> huge change in options.](https://preview.redd.it/u85hb89o9q7c1.png?width=3242&format=png&auto=webp&s=9ad0f8e565ee8965d2bf9688b9bc83fc927f4946)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn that period of time, the ORCL 12/22 $105c moved from $0.14 at the lows last Friday, to $1.90 this Monday. This is nearly a **15x** over 2 trading days, from just a 5% move in the underlying! ORCL consolidated nicely at $100 and post-ER IV crush allowed these contracts to get super nice and cheap.\n\n# Example 2: AVGO vs $900: 1400x \ud83e\udd2f\n\nAVGO has been nothing short of magic. It treated $800, $900, and $1000 all as perfect support/resistance levels. AVGO also recently had ER on 12/7, during which it sold off to $900. Now with IV crush in place, and with a sprinkle of good news ([partnerships](https://www.stocktitan.net/news/AVGO/caltech-and-broadcom-announce-quantum-research-and-development-jcv126kwus8b.html), PT upgrades), it launched off $900.\n\n[AVGO vs $800, $900, $1000](https://preview.redd.it/35761b2r9q7c1.png?width=3306&format=png&auto=webp&s=f3f04a0e3eeabf22fd64080109a365ef125a6528)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[AVGO 12\\/15 $1050c](https://preview.redd.it/4fjde080aq7c1.png?width=3316&format=png&auto=webp&s=498c77ad91e881c03f3b8c8f959d8a21298727bf)\n\nAVGO 12/15 $1050c made a move from $.05 -> $70 in just days. 1400x \ud83e\udd2f What really enabled this to amplify was that the IV crush post-ER turned these contracts into pennies. That coupled with the fact that AVGO is a very high dollar stock, which enables out of the money (OTM) contracts to quickly become many dollars in the money (ITM) with a small % move in the stock.\n\n**Tiny % changes in underlying can result in HUGE changes in options for high dollar stocks.**\n\n# Why high dollar stocks?\n\nThese kinds of gains are very hard to find in small dollar stocks. The reason is simple: with high dollar stocks, a small % move in underlying can turn penny contracts into deep ITM multi dollar contracts. For low dollar stocks, unless your underlying sees massive moves (think 50%+ move in underlying), these returns just aren't possible. On these low dollar stocks, a penny contract very rarely turns into multi-dollar because this requires the contract to go many bucks ITM. I.e. you'll need a very large % change in the underlying.\n\nAs mentioned above, for high dollar stocks, all you need is a small % move in underlying to get penny contracts into multi buck contracts.\n\n# Takeaways\n\n1. Big psychological levels tend to present significant trading opportunities\n2. **Options on high dollar stocks trading at these big psych levels can result in HUGE returns.** Penny contracts can quickly become multi-dollar contracts as they go in the money. This is not something you find often with small dollar stocks.\n3. Post ER, options contracts face an IV crush. This presents significant opportunities if the underlying consolidates at a psych level. **Cheap contracts => amplified returns**.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo fellow degens, in short, **options** on **high dollar** stocks at **big** **psych Levels** = **magic \ud83e\uddd9**",

    "title": "The Confluence of Active Learning and Neural Networks: A Paradigm Shift in AI and the Strategic Implications for Oracle",
    "selftext": "&#x200B;\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe rapid advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) have been nothing short of revolutionary, transforming industries and reshaping the way we interact with technology. However, these advancements come with their own set of challenges, notably the \"black box\" problem in neural networks. This issue refers to the lack of transparency and interpretability in how these complex models arrive at their decisions, a problem that is particularly acute in sectors where understanding the decision-making process is crucial, such as healthcare, finance, and legal systems.\n\n## The Black Box Problem: A Recap\n\n[ Photo via the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. ](https://preview.redd.it/a3oeu6afknpb1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f8b32e16d216c8b575a67483e98ac761d19c246f)\n\n### High Dimensionality and Complexity\n\nNeural networks, especially deep learning models, often consist of millions or even billions of parameters. This high dimensionality makes it difficult to understand what each parameter or group of parameters is doing. Mathematically, this can be represented as navigating through a high-dimensional parameter space \u0398, where each point *\u03b8* represents a unique configuration of the model.\n\n### Non-linear Transformations\n\nThe use of non-linear activation functions introduces complex transformations, making it challenging to mathematically describe or visualize the model's behavior. Specifically, these non-linear transformations can be represented as  *f*(*x*;*\u03b8*), where *f* is the activation function and *x* is the input.\n\n### Layered Architecture\n\nThe hierarchical nature of deep neural networks, where each layer learns different data representations, adds another layer of complexity to the interpretability problem. Each layer can be considered as a function *fi*\u200b that transforms its input to produce an output for the next layer, forming a composite function *f*(*f*1\u200b(*f*2\u200b(...*fn*\u200b(*x*)...))).\n\n### Computational and Ethical Challenges\n\nTechniques like LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) and SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations) offer some interpretability but at a high computational cost. The computational complexity of these methods can be denoted as *O*(*n*2) or higher, depending on the algorithm. Furthermore, the lack of transparency can lead to ethical and legal challenges, including biases and the need for explainability in automated decisions as demanded by frameworks like GDPR.\n\n## Active Learning: A Potential Game-Changer\n\nActive learning, a technique that allows algorithms to learn by selecting the most informative data points, offers a promising avenue to address some of these challenges. By focusing on the most informative data points, active learning could facilitate a more interpretable, efficient, and focused model training process. This could offer more insights into the complex mappings learned by the network, thereby partially alleviating the black box problem.\n\n### Applications Across Domains\n\n* **Medical Diagnosis**: Active learning could be used to train neural networks to diagnose diseases more accurately and efficiently, using less medical imaging data. This could lead to earlier and more targeted treatment, which could save lives. For example, active learning could be used to train neural networks to detect cancer cells in medical images with greater accuracy than traditional methods.\n* **Fraud Detection**: In the financial sector, active learning could be used to train models for detecting fraudulent activities more efficiently. This could protect businesses and consumers from financial losses. For example, active learning could be used to train neural networks to detect fraudulent credit card transactions with greater accuracy than traditional methods.\n* **Product Development**: In consumer-focused industries, active learning could help in developing products that better meet consumer needs. This could lead to more innovative and successful products and services. For example, active learning could be used to train neural networks to develop new clothing styles that are more likely to be popular with consumers.\n* **Self-driving Cars**: Active learning could be used to train neural networks to handle complex driving conditions more safely. This could lead to self-driving cars that are more trustworthy and can be used in a wider range of environments. For example, active learning could be used to train neural networks to handle dangerous situations such as sudden changes in traffic conditions or unexpected obstacles.\n* **Natural Language Processing**: In tasks like machine translation and text summarization, active learning could lead to more accurate and efficient models. This could lead to better language translation tools and more concise and informative summaries of text documents. For example, active learning could be used to train neural networks to translate text from one language to another with greater accuracy than traditional methods, even when the training data is limited.\n\n### Broader Implications\n\n* **Improved Safety**: By focusing on challenging and dangerous data points, active learning could make neural networks safer in critical applications. This is because active learning can be used to train neural networks on the most challenging and dangerous data points, which can help to identify and mitigate potential safety risks.\n* **Reduced Bias**: Active learning could help in selecting data points that are more representative, thereby reducing model bias. This is because active learning can be used to select data points that are representative of the real world, which can help to train neural networks that make fair and unbiased predictions.\n* **Greater Transparency**: Active learning could help identify influential data points, making the model's decisions more understandable. This is because active learning can be used to identify the data points that are most influential on a neural network's predictions, which can help us to understand why the neural network makes the predictions that it does.\n\n## Oracle's Strategic Positioning\n\nOracle's recent patent for active learning for neural network training could be a significant breakthrough, offering them a competitive edge in the AI and ML space.\n\n### Financial Implications for Oracle\n\n* **Increased Demand for Cloud Services**: As active learning becomes more prevalent, Oracle's cloud computing services, which can be used to train and deploy neural networks, could see increased demand.\n* **New Products and Services**: Oracle could leverage its patented active learning technology to develop new, more efficient, and interpretable AI-based solutions.\n* **Strategic Partnerships**: Oracle could form alliances with companies in healthcare, finance, and other sectors to develop specialized solutions based on active learning.\n\n### Stock Market Implications\n\nOracle's patent could potentially drive its stock prices up, given the broad applications and demand for more interpretable and efficient AI models. However, it's essential to note that this is not financial advice.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe integration of active learning techniques into neural network training has the potential to revolutionize the field of AI, addressing some of the most pressing challenges related to model interpretability and efficiency. Oracle's strategic move to patent active learning technology positions them favorably in this evolving landscape, with potential benefits not just for the company but for the broader application of AI in multiple sectors.\n\nThe future of AI appears to be on the cusp of another significant transformation, and active learning could very well be the catalyst for this change. As research and development continue, it will be fascinating to see how active learning reshapes the AI landscape and how companies like Oracle capitalize on these advancements.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Oracle ($ORCL) filed a patent, monkeys may now understand ai fr fr\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[i will be returning to the forests after this goodbye](https://preview.redd.it/jy0883s4mnpb1.jpg?width=976&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f53ba54cfb02427fc9e01207e5c5780b3f17511f)",

Form 4 data is impacted by a concept known as backfill which is par for the course with transactional data. The delay between the Filing Date and the Transaction Date is \\*roughly\\* 2 days and your mileage will vary. This means that more transactions for past dates can arrive in future filings. That is why looking at larger trends is key.\n2. To combat backfill, filings through this Tuesday are included \\*if\\* the transaction date is from the prior week. Otherwise, transactions from this week are excluded.\n3. Data was pulled by the algorithms behind Form Fore\n\n# 1.

    "selftext": "Roku, a key player in the streaming industry, has shown promising performance in Q1 2023, with a noteworthy reduction in operating losses to $212.5 million. Moreover, in Q1 2023, Roku posted revenues of $740.99 million, a slight increase of 0.99% when compared to the same quarter in the previous year.\n\nIn terms of user growth, the company added 1.6 million active streaming accounts in Q1 2023, pushing the total active accounts to 71.6 million. Furthermore, Roku has forecasted a net revenue of $770 million for Q2 2023.\n\nIn the realm of market analysis, the consensus rating for Roku is \"Hold\". The mean price target for Roku's stock is $71.04, signifying an upside potential of 4.53%, with projections ranging from a high of $115 to a low of $41.\n\nConsidering these performance metrics and market expectations, we can develop a bullish thesis for Roku's next earnings call. This thesis is built around several key factors:\n\n**Growing Popularity and Subscriber Base**: Roku's Smart TV operating system is gaining popularity and the company added 1.6 million new active accounts in Q1 2023. This is a clear indicator that the company's user base is on the rise and reflects the growing demand for streaming services.\n\n**Improved Financial Performance**: Roku's ability to trim operating losses showcases the company's effective expense management. This is an indication that Roku is optimizing its operations and has a potential pathway to profitability.\n\n**Competitive Features**: Roku's offerings are impressive, providing a good balance of cost and performance. For instance, the 55r6a5r model supports all HDR formats, has a quantum dot layer for enhanced color performance, and runs on the Linux-based Roku OS.\n\n**Price Point and Color Accuracy**: Roku TVs offer a good balance between cost and performance. The QLED TVs provide a vibrant yet accurate color range, and they cover 96% of the Rec 709 color space and 80% of Rec 2020.\n\n**Brightness**: Roku's model 55r6a5r is capable of hitting 500 nits in peak brightness, which is a significant improvement over TVs in the same price range.\n\n**User Interface**: Roku's user interface is simple, easy to navigate, and doesn't bombard users with ads. This is one of its greatest strengths.\n\n**Potential for Market Expansion**: If Roku can successfully penetrate the higher price band, there's potential for them to move into the premium segment.\n\n**Positive Revenue Projection**: Roku's positive revenue forecast of $770 million for Q2 2023 indicates confidence in its business model and revenue generation capabilities.\n\n**Potential Upside in Stock Price**: The current consensus analyst rating for Roku is \"Hold\", but the high-end prediction for Roku's stock price is $115. This signals a significant upside potential.\n\nHowever, potential downsides include the limited number of zones in their 55r6a5r model leading to noticeable haloing or glowing around bright elements, the lack of support for 120Hz refresh rates and variable refresh rate features for gaming, and the requirement to create a Roku account to activate the TV.\n\nAn addendum that incorporates some extra key points:\n\n**Private Listening Features**: One of the unique selling points of Roku is its private listening feature available through their phone app and some of the remotes. This feature allows users to plug into their device for a personalized listening experience, proving especially useful for those living in shared spaces or households with different sleep schedules.\n\n**Roku OS on Affordable TVs**: Many sub-$500 TVs run on Roku OS, illustrating the popularity of Roku's software in the budget segment. This allows Roku to capture a significant segment of the market that seeks affordable smart TVs without compromising on the quality of the streaming experience.\n\n**Roku Stick and Boxes**: Consumers often pair Roku's external devices, such as sticks and boxes, with high-end TVs from manufacturers like Samsung, whose inbuilt Smart TV features may not meet user expectations or may deteriorate over time. Roku's standalone devices offer consistent performance and an intuitive user interface, which increases their appeal to users looking for a reliable streaming solution.\n\n**User-Friendly Interface**: Roku's easy-to-navigate interface with large buttons and voice-activated remote control is user-friendly, making it a popular choice among people of all ages, including older adults who may not be as tech-savvy. This ease of use and simplicity has been a major factor contributing to Roku's growth and reputation.\n\n**Regular Updates**: Unlike many manufacturers of budget TVs and set-top boxes, Roku is known for providing regular software updates. This commitment to maintaining a reliable, up-to-date user experience is another factor contributing to Roku's popularity.\n\n**Manufacturer Adoption**: From a manufacturer's perspective, adopting Roku's operating system is more convenient and cost-effective than developing, updating, and supporting their own software. This ease of integration has led to Roku OS being adopted in a wide range of devices, from budget to high-end TVs, further expanding Roku's market presence.\n\nIn summary, these factors enhance the value proposition of Roku's products and services, attracting a broad user base and fueling its growth in the competitive streaming market.\n\n**Positions:**\n\n**27 ROKU shares**\n\n**7 ROKU $69 7/28**\n\n**2 ROKU $80 9/15**\n\nall ROKU positions entered today\n\n**1 NFLX $475 7/21 (cheers on being the only streaming company that cuts leeches)**\n\nCredentials: actual Autism Spectrum Disorder with a hyper fixation on the stock market and using being insanely nerdy about shit to make hella bread.\n\nPast decent trades:\n\nLoaded NVDA shares before earnings because I\u2019m a college student and I study Brain & Cognitive Science, so I just talk about AI/ML/ANN all day.\n\nChegg Puts before earnings (20x+!!) because what a shitty company, Quora for idiots who can\u2019t cheat correctly. LLMs openly trained on stolen textbooks, insanely easy play. (I was preaching on the discord show call for this one).\n\nElf beauty calls before earnings\n\nORCL shares before earnings (IV was a bit yikes)\n\nI just keep the thesis private on my SSD usually but my friend wanted to see it so I didn\u2019t feel like texting him a word doc cause that\u2019s odd isn\u2019t it? Who knows, I\u2019ll just send him this link.",

    "title": "How to make big gains on ADBE earnings tonight",
    "selftext": "Photoshop software owner Adobe (ADBE) is scheduled to announce Q2 earnings results on Thursday, June 15th, after market close. They are a SaaS company, SaaS stands for \"Software as a service.\" A software distribution model in which a cloud provider hosts applications and makes them available to end users over the internet. We're going to be going over this in detail later. Like many other cloud-based businesses powered by AI, is poised to generate substantial cash flows in the future. Particularly, Adobe's market is expected to grow at a pace of 13% until 2030. \n\nThe consensus EPS estimate is $3.79, with total revenues between $4.75 billion and $4.78 billion. The consensus mark for the same is pegged at $4.76 billion, implying growth of 8.6% from the year-ago fiscal quarter\u2019s reported figure.\n\nAccording to seeking alpha: \n\n* Over the last 2 years, ADBE has beaten EPS estimates 100% of the time and has beaten revenue estimates 88% of the time.\n\n* Over the last 3 months, EPS estimates have seen 19 upward revisions and 4 downward. \n\n* Revenue estimates have seen 15 upward revisions and 7 downward.\n\nThe company on March 15 reported Q1 Non-GAAP EPS of $3.80, ahead of estimates by 12 cents. Revenue of $4.66 billion was up 9.4% from a year ago and topped analyst expectations by at least $40 million.\n\n**Important Factors**\n\nAdobe\u2019s strong focus on its Digital Media business is likely to have aided its performance in the fiscal second quarter. Growing demand for ADBE\u2019s Digital Media Solutions, along with solid momentum across Creative Cloud and Document Cloud, is expected to have benefited the Digital Media business in the to-be-reported fiscal quarter. For second-quarter fiscal 2023, Adobe expects Digital Media revenues between $3.45-$3.47 billion.\n\n[Vladimir Dimitrov](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/vladimir-p-dimitrov-cfa-aa754932?trk=public_post_feed-actor-name), leader of the \"The Roundabout Investor\" Investing Group, wrote in a recent analysis, \"The set-up for Adobe's share price remains favourable at least in the short-run. With the narrative around generative AI gaining momentum and sell-side analysts still catching-up, ADBE could continue to outperform the broader market in the coming weeks and even months. \n\nThe rising demand for Photoshop, Lightroom and Premier Pro and solid momentum across the Adobe Express platform might have contributed well to the performance of Creative Cloud. Further, solid enterprise adoption of Acrobat and Adobe Sign is expected to have driven growth in Document Cloud revenues in the to-be-reported fiscal quarter.\n\nApart from Digital Media, strong momentum across Adobe Experience Cloud, on the heels of the rising uptake of Adobe Marketing Cloud, Adobe Analytics Cloud and Adobe Advertising Cloud, is expected to have boosted the business in the fiscal second quarter. Moreover, strength in Workfront might have been another positive.\n\nADBE expects the Digital Experience segment\u2019s revenues to grow 13% from the year-ago fiscal quarter\u2019s actuals. Also, Digital Experience subscription revenues are expected between $1.21 billion and $1.23 billion. Additionally, strong momentum in applications like Real-Time CDP and Adobe Journey Optimizer is likely to have been a tailwind.\n\n**Long Term Gains?**\n\nThe SaaS market is highly competitive, especially when compared to the overall Cloud Market, which is dominated by Amazon (AMZN). However, in the SaaS market, no single company holds a market share larger than 25%. This presents a significant advantage for all the companies operating in the SaaS market, as they can continue to grow without concerns about anti-monopoly laws that might put them in direct conflict with the U.S. Government.\n\nAmong the key players in the SaaS market are Salesforce (CRM), Adobe, Microsoft (MSFT), SAP SE (SAP), Oracle (ORCL), International Business Machines (IBM), ServiceNow (NOW), and Workday (WDAY). With a market share of 12.50%, [Adobe currently stands as the second-largest SaaS company, trailing behind Salesforce.](https://i.ibb.co/syLN2fb/EORPpAo.png)\n\nAs mentioned earlier, Adobe delivers its products through the SaaS model. It is projected that the SaaS market will reach a valuation of $149 billion by 2030, with an estimated revenue of $321.6 billion in 2026. The SaaS market can be categorized [into three segments](https://wetelo.com/blog/digitalization/global-saas-market-size-detailed-analysis): Business & Productivity, Transportation & Logistics, and Circular Economy. As evident, Adobe primarily focuses on the Business & Productivity segment. This specific segment is what's going to be reaching a valuation of $149B by 2030. \n\nSince 2018, [Adobe has experienced](https://i.ibb.co/php2nPr/EORPpAo.png) a remarkable revenue growth of 98%, corresponding to an annual growth rate of 16%. Additionally, its operating income has seen a significant increase of 112%, representing an annual growth rate of 18%. The majority of Adobe's revenue is derived from its [Subscription Revenue](https://i.ibb.co/M9Mk6jZ/MA7ypFK.png), accounting for 96% of the total revenue. As evident, Adobe heavily relies on subscriptions, thus necessitating continuous efforts to maintain its reputation and drive innovation in order to stay ahead of the competition.\n\nWhen it comes to operations, Adobe operates in a market that is already characterized by low capital intensity. Over the years, Adobe has consistently improved its [efficiency ratio](https://i.ibb.co/bRT3Bnv/EORPpAo.png). Moving on to the Balance Sheet section, we can see that Adobe has maintained a relatively healthy financial position. Despite numerous acquisitions, Adobe has managed to keep its [debt level relatively stable](https://i.ibb.co/BBT1K94/MA7ypFK.png). Their cash reserves experienced a staggering 172% increase from 2018 to 2020, and have since remained relatively stable, currently standing at $4.072 billion. Moving on to current assets and liabilities, [look at how](https://i.ibb.co/CztwNRp/MA7ypFK.png) Adobe successfully reduced its current liabilities following the acquisition last year.\n\nOverall Adobe is committed to expansion while maintaining its financial health. They prioritize reinvesting a certain amount of money back into the business whenever it exceeds a predetermined threshold.\n\n**Will they mention AI during Earnings?**\n\nAdobe is focusing on generative AI, introducing features like Firefly and [Generative Fill](https://blog.adobe.com/en/publish/2023/05/23/future-of-photoshop-powered-by-adobe-firefly) to enhance its product offerings and user experience. According to the [Adobe Blog](https://blog.adobe.com/en/publish/2023/05/10/adobe-firefly-adobe-express-google-bard), Firefly's launch in March marked one of the most successful beta launches in the history, generating over 70 million images within the first month. This AI-driven tool relies on a model that leverages hundreds of millions of photos, allowing it to generate both images and text effects based on provided descriptions. In [MoffettNathanson's Inaugural Technology, Media, and Telecom Conference](https://www.ibm.com/investor/events/svb-moffettnathanson-technology-media-and-telecom-conference), the management stated:\n\n> \"If you're Nike, for example, what are you going to want your teams to use? You're going to want them to use a commercially viable model that was trained in the right way, which you can talk about Firefly, plus all the assets that Nike has, right, that hopefully are stored in Creative Cloud or in our AEM system.\"\n\nTherefore, with a focus on incorporating AI into Adobe's products and services, it's easy to believe that Firefly will consist of multiple AI models in the future that will serve various use cases. This is particularly relevant in today's self-media-driven society, including millions of business owners and influencers on TikTok and YouTube Shorts, where the demand for such capabilities is rapidly growing.\n\nAdditionally, I think what makes Firefly stand out from other generative AI tools is its distinctive feature. Firefly will provide the capability to generate images that are safe for commercial use, without infringing on copyrighted materials. The management continued:\n\n> \"They wanted to be a commercially viable asset that has -- we have kind of credentials that can show that it can be used. If they want to sell it or if they want to put it on and have it being add on Instagram or whatever else, there are signals in the market that the commercial viability of assets is going to matter, just like you can't use a copyrighted image on Google necessarily on Instagram.\"\n\nIt's simple to see a comparative advantage for this functionality in the future if Firefly is able to produce copyright-free images that may be utilised directly in ongoing projects with efficiency. Firefly may be used as a time-effective AI tool, enabling users to train and enhance models using their own material, in response to the growing need for AI skills from people and businesses.\n\nIn addition to this, the company's partnership with Google's Bard expands Firefly's reach and potential for increased user engagement. So there's no reason why they wouldn't mention AI at least a hundred times. Users will be able to continue their creative journey seamlessly in Adobe Express. Firefly will enhance and showcase text-to-image capabilities within Bard, allowing users of all skill levels to describe their creative ideas using their own words and generate Firefly images directly within Bard. I believe this integration differentiates Firefly from other generative AI tools in the market, which offers users a more intuitive creative experience.\n\nThe company has demonstrated its dedication to embracing generative AI and fostering creativity among artists and content creators. Generative Fill, powered by Firefly in Photoshop (beta), will be available to the public in 2H CY2023. I think all these AI features will add value to their service, and can even be treated as a standalone subscription model. Despite a recent 32% rally due to the AI optimism, the stock is currently trading at 32x P/E TTM, which is lower than the 5-year average of 40x. Therefore, I'm bullish on ADBE.\n\n**What to do for Earnings?**\n\nGiven Adobe's [previous track record of beating consensus projections for its quarterly results](https://i.ibb.co/Mn1mnVH/EORPpAo.png), it wouldn't be surprising if the firm once again exceeded them. This, along with the compelling AI storyline, might result in a significant reaction in the company's share price. Contracts are expensive so I'll be getting a call spread. I'll be buying the 6/16 500c for a whopping $1400, and selling the 520c for $830. This means I can get the call spread for $570, offering a maximum gain of 3.6x if the stock moves up 6% - which is the average move with earnings. Keep in mind tho, this post is meant to just educate people about what we tend to look for when making an earning prediction. It by no means can be considered financial or investment advice. I've reposted this DD without any imgur links so the auto-mod doesn't remove the post.",

    "title": "What you need to do for ORCL earnings tonight.",
    "selftext": "Oracle (ORCL) kicks off a relatively light week for corporate earnings reports, with the enterprise software firm set to disclose its fiscal fourth-quarter results today after close. The stock is currently trading at record highs today, up 5.8% at $116.28 at last glance, and earlier hitting a peak of $117. Analysts, on average, expect ORCL to unveil earnings of $1.58 per share, up 2.6% year-over-year (YoY), on $13.7 billion in revenue (+15.9% YoY). ORCL is expected to report a YoY increase in both profit and revenue for FQ4, which will partly be due to the integration of health information technologies firm Cerner, the acquisition of which closed in November 2022. Over the last 2 years, ORCL has beaten EPS estimates 75% of the time and has beaten revenue estimates 75% of the time. However, in early March they posted mixed FQ3 results and provided an outlook that generally failed to excite investors.\n\nJ.P. Morgan Securities raised its price target to $109 from $93 ahead of the results, and over the weekend, Wolfe Research upgraded the shares to \"outperform from \"peer perform,\" citing tailwinds related to artificial intelligence (AI). Over the last 3 months, EPS estimates have seen 23 upward revisions and 0 downward. Revenue estimates have seen 9 upward revisions and 11 downward.\n\nORCL has finished three of its past eight post-earnings sessions higher, including a 10.4% pop last June. This time around, options traders are pricing in a next-day swing of 12.6%, regardless of direction, which is higher than the 5.2% move the stock has averaged over the past two years. \n\nThe Cerner deal (mentioned earlier) from 2022, in an all-cash transaction amounting to $28.3 billion or $95 per share, had boosted revenue estimates for ORCL, but also said that it had had a lagging effect on earnings per share. It's expected to have bolstered the company\u2019s position in the lucrative healthcare domain. In the third quarter of fiscal 2023, Cerner contributed $1.5 billion to the total revenues driven by continued strength in the Fusion, Autonomous Database and OCI services. For the fiscal fourth quarter of 2023, total cloud, including Cerner, is expected to grow from 51% to 53% at cc and from 49% to 51% in USD.\n\nORCL's cloud results will also no doubt be closely watched. ORCL is a distant fourth in the cloud computing market behind Amazon's (AMZN) Amazon Web Services, Microsoft's (MSFT) Azure and Google-parent Alphabet (GOOG), but brokerages such as Guggenheim have highlighted the benefits from such a position.\n\nAccelerated digital transformation, along with the continuation of remote work and mainstream adoption of the hybrid/flexible work model, is likely to have driven demand for Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) services and the company\u2019s other cloud-based applications in the to-be-reported quarter. Continued momentum in back-office cloud-based Fusion Human Capital Management solutions, along with NetSuite Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) and Fusion ERP applications, is expected to have favored ORCL\u2019s quarterly performance.\n\nOracle announced on May 18 that it would join the Scheduling Standards Consortium to boost logistical effectiveness. The company's ERP division may have benefited from the move of many sizable SAP clients to Oracle Fusion ERP cloud and rising deal success in a number of industries, including banking and healthcare.\n\nThe strong uptake of Oracle's Dedicated Region Cloud and next-generation Autonomous Database, underpinned by machine learning and artificial intelligence capabilities, may have helped the bottom line. Gen2 public cloud architecture is seeing significant momentum for autonomous databases.\n\nIt's increasingly obvious that calls are going to be the play for this one. I'm going to buy the 120c for 3.60 and sell the 125c for 2.30. This means I can get the spread for $130 and potentially make 3.8x gains on this one. Keep in mind tho, as with all my other posts, these are entirely meant to just educate people about what we tend to look for when making an earning prediction. It by no means can be considered financial or investment advice.\n\nEdit: My account has been banned for a single comment I've posted unrelated to /r/wallstreetbets on another subreddit.

    "selftext": "**Disclosure**: I'm not invested, and don't intend to invest/short CRM.\n\n[CRM Thinking It's 2019](https://preview.redd.it/n0euuj1s19ia1.jpg?width=355&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=00baed71eeab193c926784182763e55f0987a3e2)\n\nTLDR: Investors may change their view on CRM as they see clients cutting on spending, and competitors starting to take market share by developing in specialized niches. CRM's growth verticals are drying up, and the company will meet expectations on earnings day, but may have little to offer for the future.\n\nAlso, I'm great at being wrong.\n\n# Analysis\n\nEarnings date: 1st March. \n\nMarket cap: $170b\n\nMy estimated value: $118b = 30% downside\n\n[CRM est. Intrinsic Value of $118b](https://preview.redd.it/9i6vy07vs8ia1.png?width=604&format=png&auto=webp&s=7e4e78e94d9870891d4ea6903abf3523935d0ead)\n\nModel: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/163a1XCFOcl7wOBvnOUk-v-4EcOoLmS7MVOKD9RHjoS8/copy](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/163a1XCFOcl7wOBvnOUk-v-4EcOoLmS7MVOKD9RHjoS8/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nCRM [expects](https://investor.salesforce.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2022/Salesforce-Announces-Solid-Third-Quarter-Fiscal-2023-Results/default.aspx) to end 2023 with $31b in revenue, implying a 20% Y/Y growth.\n\nMy view is that CRM has settled into its market share and there are no high-growth verticals coming in the near future. Even growth acquisitions will be harder to pull off given higher interest rates.\n\nThe way I see it, investors were right in slowly bleeding CRM's valuation, however we are experiencing a bump in equity values across stocks which will be corrected in CRM over time as investors are hit with negative surprises changing their growth and profitability story.\n\nHere are my future expectations for CRM:\n\n[My Expected Growth Model for CRM](https://preview.redd.it/p3henzqju8ia1.png?width=604&format=png&auto=webp&s=c666490b9ccf83001bb0e22ffa2f2ce0d23d79aa)\n\nYou can see that even this model may be optimistic as I am giving CRM 25% EBIT margins, and $80b revenue at maturity. \n\nMy guess is that management will change the story on growth, pretending to be focused on profitability, and investors will slowly change the expectation of margins on account of the increasing competition in CRM/ERP software. As technology costs go down, smaller companies can offer specialized solutions that are going to take market share from the company, and existing clients will start developing in-house alternatives in a bid to \"tighten the belt\" during 2023.\n\n# CRM's Friends\n\nCompetitors include:\n\n* SAP: Enterprise grade ERP, CRM + analytics\n* MSFT: Teams + Dynamics + Office\n* ORCL: Hyperion ERP\n* GOOGL: Productivity suite for small-med businesses. But mostly there to illustrate how bad things can get if investors panic.\n* Additional peers: SAGE, HubSpot, ServiceNow, Atlassian, Asana   \n\n[CRM Peers By Industry And Market Size](https://preview.redd.it/rfv2h02nv8ia1.png?width=604&format=png&auto=webp&s=e9cf7be81eb11869c4b071d2eb45c28b109ac738)\n\nWe can see that the market is still pricing CRM at 6x EV/Sales which is usually attributed to high-growth companies. To me, CRM's growth story stopped even before the acquisition of Slack, but the company was able to leverage high equity valuations and cheap debt to produce higher revenue numbers. They managed to stretch their market, but likely overpaid on it and destroyed investor's equity value.\n\n# Short-term Sentiment Based on Options\n\nExpiry 24.Feb.2023\n\nSomeone is betting big around $175, but the general distribution is -3.5% negative. This is just my way of looking at sentiment it means very little, but may help if you want to trade earnings.\n\n[CRM's SQRT Transformed Call And Put Volumes.

And now this comes out:   OPENAI, NVIDIA TO ANNOUNCE BILLIONS IN UK DATA CENTER PROJECTS\n\nSo that lands them in the realm of needing maybe $500+ billion in the next 4 years? They don\u2019t make money, they burn money, so it\u2019s not coming out of pocket. Maybe they go public and aim for a 1 trillion starting valuation? I know there are changes with their MSFT deal happening right now, not sure if listing is on the table. Or is the US government just giving them a blank check? None of these options seem overly likely.\n\n$ wise none of this adds up, and it\u2019s really starting to look like a giant scam to me. Yes ai has great uses, yes it is not going anywhere. But it\u2019s also not profitable, at all. Not even close. All of the mega caps are burning huge amounts of money getting this all set up, with the plan to monetize it down the road. META had its panic moment when they started overpaying to poach talent, probably because they realized that llm\u2019s hit a wall that would result in ai not being as profitable as projected. \n\nI think we may be in the stage where all companies start lying about future capex and revenue streams. At this point they have to. Just look at NVDA, renting back its own products lol, clever, but not actually a good thing. \n\nIf the mega caps admit they need to scale back the ai roll out or drastically extend the timelines to complete these data center projects, then bye bye stock price. But it is hard for public companies to just straight up lie. OpenAI has less public eyeballs on their books. Can they really afford all of this? They are saying they can, and ORCL had an amazing day thanks to that. So maybe that is the play now. As the music gets closer to stopping, we will see more and more projects get announced from OpenAI and possibly some of the other non-publicly traded ai companies. \n\nThese lies buy the industry time, which will allow the publicly traded companies to do offerings, maybe sell some stock, and just generally prepare for the coming market downturn. In turn, they agree to support the companies that are helping them fake these expansion / future revenue numbers right now. Because when the ball drops, and the capex bonfire is still burning hot, it\u2019s going to get ugly. \n\nWhen will this finally fall apart? Who knows. Maybe 3 months. Maybe 1 year. Maybe 2 years if the government drops rates to zero and hands out blank checks to all ai companies. But it will hit, and it won\u2019t be pretty. The warning signs are already showing. ",

The Neocloud providers like Nebius (and CoreWeave) are benefiting from AI compute demand, and big tech is signaling that the AI party is continuing for now, overall a bullish sign for compute companies.\n\n[**CRCL (Circle)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=CRCL&p=d) **/** [**FIGR (Figure)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=FIGR&p=d)\\- FIGR IPO has been upsized, so CRCL has reacted positively to the news, I'm currently watching both leading up to the IPO of FIGR.

The surge of crypto\u2011industry IPOs sparked by Circle\u2019s $1.05\u202fB listing has been part of the IPO market coming back.

    "selftext": "The MI350 is close enough to Nvidia's performance that AMD can finally charge something closer to a premium price. This chip is no longer just an affordable alternative - it's being used in real-world, mission-critical AI workloads. Most importantly, this is the \u201cearly inflection point\u201d in the changing competitive landscape you've been watching.\n\n\n\nRevenue and margin gains are real \n\nAt higher average selling prices, AMD has been able to grow significantly without having to dramatically increase volume. Even the relatively low volume of the MI350 ($25K) is likely to boost Q3 and Q4 results, especially considering that they will be compared to a period when China's exports were hit hard. Margins could also improve: shifting more of the GPU portfolio to higher-end SKUs will help close AMD's earnings gap with Nvidia and Broadcom - which still limits AMD's P/E ratio.\n\n\n\nThe market expects AMD's GPU revenue to be around $1.65 billion in the third quarter. If MI355X grows as expected in the second half of the year and prices move in line with expectations, AMD's revenue could be revised upward.\n\n\n\nMajor customers could be behind this move \n\nAMD wouldn't be pressing prices so aggressively unless major cloud service providers such as Meta ( META ) and Oracle ( ORCL ) were on board. There is growing evidence that these customers are no longer just interested in AMD's GPUs, but are actually actively deploying them. We saw early signs of this in our Q1 earnings call and earnings filings. Customers appear to be buying AMD's complete AI platform, including ROCm, system integration and long-term support.\n\n\n\nAMD vs. Nvidia: The Price Gap is Narrowing \n\nEven at $25K, the MI350 is less expensive than Nvidia's B200, making AMD an attractive choice for workloads such as inference, especially among enterprises and second-tier cloud service providers that can't justify Nvidia's pricing. This creates an optimal balance of \u201cvalue and performance,\u201d and AMD is helping to lead the way in certain market segments. This marks a significant shift in the competitive landscape.\n\n\n\nRisks remain, but the narrative is changing \n\nHeadwinds remain. China's export restrictions could result in a revenue reduction of \\~$800 million in the second half of 2025, and it is unclear if or when licenses will resume. mi355x needs to be released smoothly and continue the momentum of mi350 - any issues with the software or system will be closely watched. rocm is still lagging behind CUDA in developer adoption. Still lagging behind CUDA in terms of adoption, but improving: ROCm now offers day one support for LLaMA 4 and there are over 2 million models optimized for AMD GPUs on Hugging Face.\n\n\n\nOverall \n\nThis indicates a shift in AMD's strategy. It supports our broader view that the company is no longer confined to the role of low-cost alternative, but is moving towards leadership in AI computing. If these pricing trends continue - and especially if they trigger even a modest \u201cahead-of-the-curve\u201d cycle - the market may begin to reassess AMD as less of a traditional chipmaker and more of a AMD as less of a traditional chipmaker and more of a platform company. As these fundamentals strengthen, the technological breakthroughs we've seen from AMD, especially relative to NVIDIA, could begin to gain real staying power.",

Oracle's free cash flow could increase by $3.3 billion, or $1.12 per share.\n\nMateen said, \"The average return for software companies that pay cash taxes is about 9%, largely due to more favourable R&D treatment ...... It's also worth noting that these are tax accounting changes, not financial accounting, and are largely based on the fact that tax benefits related to R&D and bonus depreciation are being brought forward .\"\n\nThe bill includes the reinstatement of domestic R&D expensing. In addition, the bill provides for a 100 per cent rebate of bonus depreciation for qualified capital expenditures placed in service between 2025 and 2029.\n\nEvercore noted, \u2018The net impact is an additional 80% cash tax savings on 2025 R&D expenses.\u2019 \"On the capital expenditure side, \u201cbonus depreciation\u201d on capital expenditure is gradually reduced from 2022 onwards, meaning that by 2025, 40 per cent of capital expenditure is immediately deductible for cash tax purposes, with the remaining 60 per cent amortised over the useful life of the asset. As a result of OBBB, all capital expenditures will receive 100 per cent \u201cbonus depreciation\u201d in the first year.\"\n\nMicrosoft and Oracle are among the software companies benefiting from high capital expenditures. evercore estimates that the companies will spend $69.7 billion and $23.6 billion on capital expenditures in 2025. Much of this capex is related to artificial intelligence and data centre construction.\n\nEvercore rates Microsoft Outperform and raised its price target to $515 from $500. Oracle is also rated Outperform and its price target was raised to $215 from $180.\n\nAdditionally, Evercore expects investment in artificial intelligence and the technology sector in general to increase as companies in a variety of industries reap the benefits.",

Mainly interested on the short side of this due to the Iran/Israel conflict and oil surging and affecting all stocks on the market. Was interested in a short on the overnight exchanges yesterday. Watching $220 level. Also likely affected by Meta's superintelligence push and signal to continue spending in AI space.\n\n[**SATS (EchoStar)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SATS&p=d)\\-Trump urged EchoStar and FCC to resolve spectrum license dispute. This happened at the close on Friday but it seems this won't hold up the move completely (currently $24 vs $27). DirecTV terminated its agreement to acquire EchoStar's satellite television business last year over a failed debt-exchange offer. The FCC told EchoStar it was investigating the company's compliance obligations to provide 5G service in the U.S. (due to its buildout extension and mobile-satellite service).\n\n[**USO**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=USO&p=d) **/** [**GLD**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=GLD&p=d) **/** [**VXX**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=VXX&p=d) \\- Day 4 of Iran/Israel conflict, USO/Vol/gold has been elevated since the attacks. Mainly looking for escalation, since the conflict has been signaled to last weeks, I will likely not do anything in this until escalation occurs. Middle Eastern conflict (especially between countries) drive energy costs up and gold/vol rallies during risk-off events (like war). Not an immediate trade worth looking at today, likely this will happen during OVERNIGHT or afterhours. \n\n[**CRCL (Circle)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=CRCL&p=d) \\- Set ATH after a recent explosive IPO. IPOs lately have been explosive. Already broke the $140 level, watching the $150 level next but unlikely to go extremely heavy in this even if we get up there. Remember that CRCL is heavily intertwined with the C industry and essentially is one of the stableCs. The big C is already near ATH, so I'm interested in seeing if we're able to make a significant move today.",

    "selftext": "Oracle\u00a0shares soared 15% on Thursday and headed for a record close and their best day since 2021, after the database software vendor issued\u00a0robust earnings\u00a0and a strong forecast, fueled by growth in cloud.\n\nRevenue climbed 11% year over year during the fiscal fourth quarter to $15.9 billion, topping the $15.59 billion average estimate, according to LSEG. Adjusted earnings per share of $1.70 exceeded the average analyst estimate of $1.64.\n\n\u201cAll told, ORCL has entered an entirely new wave of enterprise popularity that it has not seen since the Internet era in the late 90s,\u201d Piper Sandler analysts wrote in a note to clients. The firm was one of several to lift its price target on the stock, raising its prediction to $190 from $130.\n\nOracle has been making headway in the cloud infrastructure market to challenge\u00a0Amazon,\u00a0Google\u00a0and\u00a0Microsoft. It\u2019s still small by comparison, with $3 billion in cloud revenue during the May quarter, compared with over $12 billion for Google, which counts productivity software subscriptions and cloud infrastructure sales when reporting cloud metrics. But Oracle\u2019s business is growing faster.\n\nFuture expansion can also come from sales of Oracle\u2019s database on clouds other than its own.\n\n\u201cThe growth rate in multi-cloud is astonishing,\u201d Oracle Chairman\u00a0Larry Ellison\u00a0said on Wednesday\u2019s conference call with analysts. \u201cIn other words, our database is now moving very rapidly to the cloud, I think because \u2013 a few reasons, because the database has now all these AI capabilities, but also, quite frankly, now people can get it in whatever cloud they want.\u201d\n\nRemaining performance obligations, a measurement of money that\u2019s expected to be recognized as revenue in the future, sat at $138 billion, up 41% from a year earlier. Oracle CEO Safra Catz said RPO will likely more than double in the 2026 fiscal year, which ends in May 2026. Revenue for the new fiscal year should come in above $67 billion, she said. That\u2019s higher than LSEG\u2019s $65.18 billion consensus.\n\nGains from OpenAI\u2019s Stargate artificial intelligence data center project, targeting $500 billion in investments over four years, are not yet included in forecasts.\n\n\u201cIf Stargate turns out to be, everything is advertised, then we\u2019ve understated our RPO growth,\u201d Ellison said.\n\nFor fiscal 2029, revenue should be above the $104 billion target the company set in September, Catz said.\n\nStill, the company faces the challenge of meeting client demand in cloud.\n\n\u201cDemand continues to dramatically outstrip supply,\u201d Catz said, though she added that the company isn\u2019t having trouble sourcing\u00a0Nvidia\u00a0graphics processing units.\n\nAnalysts at RBC, who recommend holding the stock, raised their price target to $195 to $145. But they noted that, \u201cwith the backdrop of continued capacity constraints, we struggle to see a path to meaningful acceleration in the near term.\u201d\n\nSource: [https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/12/oracle-shares-pop-15percent-to-record-high-on-earnings-beat-cloud-optimism.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/12/oracle-shares-pop-15percent-to-record-high-on-earnings-beat-cloud-optimism.html)",

Trump announced a 'done deal' in the rare earths deal, causing a small spike to the market premarket. The buying opportunity was the day of the tweets but obviously, still interesting to see if the Trump/Musk relationship can be completely repaired. It seems both sides are playing damage control and trying to repair the rift. There's been huge discontent from Musk due to Trump's \"Big Beautiful Bill,\" but we've moved from 325->275 ->335. MASSIVE move and trade of the month.\n\n[**OUST (Ouster)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=OUST&p=d)\\-Premarket announcement that the US Department of Defense approved its OS1 digital lidar sensor for use in unmanned aerial systems. Most of the move occurred premarket, but will be watching to see if we make another leg higher- the daily chart looks near parabolic if we move up again today/tomorrow with a move from 7.50 to 20 in the past month.\n\n[**CRWV (Coreweave)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=CRWV&p=d)\\- Staying surprisingly resilient at \\~$160, we've also seen upward momentum an hour before the open (154->160). Overall nothing too compelling for a short unless we rocket past 160 to something ludicrous, this has stayed up longer/stronger than CRCL so far more interested in this.\n\n[**ASTS (AST SpaceMobile)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=ASTS&p=d)\\-Somewhat still hovering fairly high from Jeff Bezos posting a picture that implied a partnership. This has diverged from RKLB's move up, and is still hovering around $36. Nothing too compelling unless we make a leg higher.

Cook will likely use the event to address the company's new products, services, and partnerships. GameStop could clarify its cryptocurrency strategy on the company's earnings call, set for Tuesday. Key companies in the growing\u00a0artificial intelligence (AI)\u00a0market are also scheduled to update investors on their financials during the week.\n\nA U.S. inflation report scheduled for Wednesday could indicate whether President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs are beginning to have an effect on the economy. The news follows a\u00a0healthy jobs report\u00a0Friday.\n\nAfter markets shook off trade tensions last week to bring the S&P 500\u00a0back above 6000, investors will keep an eye on tariffs as\u00a0Trump\u2019s deadline on trade deals approaches. At the same time, the Senate will continue to work toward passage of Trump\u2019s \u201cBig, Beautiful\u201d budget bill amid\u00a0increasing criticism\u00a0from Tesla CEO and\u00a0former Department of Government Efficiency Chief Elon Musk.\n\n# Economists Look for Inflation\u2019s Impact in May CPI Report\n\nWednesday\u2019s expected release of the\u00a0Consumer Price Index (CPI)\u00a0will be the first look at inflation from May. With a Federal Reserve meeting around the corner, the report could set the tone for the central bank as it faces pressure from Trump to lower interest rates. Fed officials are in their blackout period ahead of their next two-day meeting, which begins June 17.\n\nTrump\u2019s tariffs\u00a0will be a key topic in Friday\u2019s consumer sentiment report, which dropped for four straight months before\u00a0leveling out in May. Consumers are\u00a0consistently worried\u00a0that tariffs will drive inflation higher, sending the closely watched survey to some of its lowest readings since the pandemic. As inflation has lately appeared in check, the freefall in sentiment may have hit bottom.\n\n# GameStop Reports As It Jumps into Bitcoin Market\n\nGameStop\u2019s (GME) earnings report comes as the video-game retailer dips its toe in the cryptocurrency pool. The company, which\u00a0fired up the meme stock craze\u00a0in 2021 with its meteoric rise, announced in late May that it\u00a0bought $500 million in bitcoin. With its\u00a0retail video game business in decline, GameStop looks to emulate the playbook of Michael Saylor\u2019s Strategy (MSTR) and other companies\u00a0centering their business models on buying bitcoin.\n\nAI will be a key theme in other corporate earnings this week. Oracle\u2019s (ORCL) report on Wednesday follows the January announcement that the database software firm would join ChatGPT maker OpenAI and\u00a0SoftBank\u00a0as part of a joint venture known as\u00a0Stargate\u00a0to build AI infrastructure. Adobe\u2019s (ADBE) report on Thursday is also expected to focus on the\u00a0company\u2019s sales of AI-enhanced graphics software.\n\n# This Week\u2019s Calendar\n\n**Monday, June 9**\n\n* Wholesale inventories (April)\n* Apple\u2019s (AAPL) WWDC conference begins with CEO Tim Cook's keynote address and special event\n* Key Earnings: Casey\u2019s General Stores (CASY)\n\n**Tuesday, June 10**\n\n* NFIB Small Business Optimism Index (May)\n* Key Earnings: GameStop, J.M.

    "title": "Why I am extremely bullish",
    "selftext": "I know this may contradict prevailing sentiment but I hope you can at least hear me out. I\u2019ve been buying the tariff dip on margin, with $1.4 million invested in blue chip stocks. I\u2019m up 46% in the past month. My largest buys have been in TSM, NVDA, ORCL, CAVA, AMZN, MSFT, META & SMH.\n\n1. Largest tax cut in history is coming. Republicans own the house and senate, and Trump is deadset on cutting taxes by $5 trillion. Obviously not good for the national debt but that will juice the economy big time. \n\n2. Midterms are coming in 2026, and Trump will not want to have a recession on his hands which would risk him loosing the house and senate. I am fully convinced he launched this tariff war so early on, so he could get it over with before midterms. Trump has pivoted extremely quickly on all reciprocal tariffs aside from china. And he is desperate to start negotiations with china. China and the U.S have both entered a de escalatatory tone, with both sides  making exemptions to tariffs, china expressing willingness to deal with fentanyl, and acknowledging the desire to negotiate- along side acknowledging that the U.S has reached out to them. They are BOTH eager to water down these tariffs and deep down, when both parties want the same thing (reduced tariffs) they will find a way to get it despite all the public bluster. Even if a deal could take months, they will likely have a pause either during or before negotiations. \n\n\n3. Rate cuts are coming later this year. It\u2019s likely there will be at least 2 rate cuts before year\u2019s end assuming tariff inflation does not cause extreme inflation. Rate cuts will boost the ability to borrow capital, increase liquidity and stimulating the economy. \n\n4. We are at the dawn of the largest productivity revolution in history. Everyone has seemed to forget about AI despite big tech earnings and guidance blowing it out of the park. MSFT, GOOG, and META are printing money, and AI is showing incredible returns in the semiconductor and data center space. We are still in the early stages of AI, the smarter it gets the more productivity will increase. \n\n5. The economy is currently strong. Jobs numbers in April (not a lagging indicator) were impressive. At the end of the day, so long as people are not losing their jobs the U.S consumer will stay resilient. Tariff effects could disrupt that if they stay in effect long term. However I think it\u2019s pretty obvious the worst of the tariffs are temporary. \n\n6. U.S exceptionalism is nowhere close to ending. We are miles ahead of every other economy in terms of innovation and technology. We lead in services, and nobody is boycotting GOOG, META, MSFT etc in a significant way. These innovative tech companies exist nowhere else in scale and success. Our consumer is 30% of the global economy and nowhere do they have such a wealthy large pool of consumers. We are still the world reserve currency with 59% of currency held abroad is dollars. And nobody, even Trump will let us lose that reserve currency status.",

(TSMC) (TSM) dipped nearly 1% in Wednesday\u2019s pre-market trading after a Financial Times report suggested the company\u2019s recently announced $100 billion U.S. investment plan reflects an \u201cintention\u201d rather than a \u201cpromise.\u201d\n\nThe report highlighted that while the pledge has temporarily eased political pressure, TSMC has yet to outline specifics on how and when the investment will be deployed, leaving investors uneasy.\n\nIt noted that TSMC\u2019s latest pledge is significantly different from past commitments. When TSMC first pledged to build semiconductor fabrication plants (fabs) in Arizona during Trump\u2019s first term, it provided detailed construction schedules.\n\nAI related stocks like $ORCL, $SAP, $AIFU, $ASML might be affected.\n\nThe same applied when it expanded its U.S. investment to $40 billion in 2022 and then $65 billion in April 2024.\n\nThis time, the company has merely stated that it will add three new fabs to the three already announced, along with two facilities for advanced packaging. No precise timeline or breakdown of the $100 billion expenditure has been given.\n\nThe report also pointed out that despite the scale of the investment, TSMC\u2019s U.S. operations will remain a fraction of its global business.\n\nAnalysts estimate that by the early 2030s, the Arizona fabs will generate no more than one-third of the company\u2019s total revenue.",

Revenue in Oracle\u2019s cloud services business jumped 10% from a year earlier to $11.01 billion, accounting for 78% of total sales.\n\nThe company\u2019s cloud infrastructure segment, which helps businesses move workloads out of their own data centers, has been booming due to demand for computing power that can support\u00a0artificial intelligence\u00a0projects.

That excludes contracts related to Stargate, Oracle CEO Safra Catz said on the call with analysts.\n\nOracle will spend around $16 billion in capital expenditures this year, which is a little more than double the total from last year, Catz added.\n\n\u201cAs always, we remain careful to pace and align our CapEx investments appropriately and in line with booking trends,\u201d Catz said.\n\nFor the current quarter, Oracle expects revenue to grow of between 8% and 10%. Analysts were expecting growth of about 11% to $15.91 billion, according to LSEG. The company said it expects adjusted earnings of $1.61 to $1.65 per share. Analysts were calling for adjusted earnings per share of $1.79.\n\nCatz said Oracle\u2019s fourth quarter adjusted earnings projections were negatively impacted by losses from an investment in another company.\n\nOracle\u2019s cloud and on-premises licenses business contributed $1.1 billion in revenue during the quarter, down 10% year over year.\n\nThe company also said it is increasing its quarterly dividend to 50 cents a share from 40 cents.\n\nAs of Monday\u2019s close, Oracle\u2019s stock is down almost 11% year to date.\n\nSource: [https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/10/oracle-orcl-q3-earnings-report-2025.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/10/oracle-orcl-q3-earnings-report-2025.html)",

However, when researching I have found that Nasdaq has different EPS numbers compared to other websites such as [investing.com](http://investing.com) or zacks.com...\n\nExample: Nasdaq says ORCL's reported EPS last quarter was 1.15 and reported EPS this quarter last year it was 1.12. source: [https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/orcl/earnings](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/orcl/earnings)\n\nHowever, [investing.com](http://investing.com) says ORCL EPS last quarter was 1.47 and reported EPS this quarter last year was 1.41? source: [https://uk.investing.com/equities/oracle-corp-earnings](https://uk.investing.com/equities/oracle-corp-earnings)\n\nCan someone explain to me like a 5 year old why there is such a big difference in these numbers? [zacks.com](http://zacks.com) seems to have the same numbers as [investing.com](http://investing.com), so is nasdaq using a different EPS calculation? Help please!",

    "title": "Trump, Chip Maker TSMC Expected to Announce $100 Billion Investment in U.S.",
    "selftext": "WASHINGTON\u2014Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. 2330 -1.92%decrease; red down pointing triangle intends to invest $100 billion in chip-manufacturing plants in the U.S. over the next four years under a plan expected to be announced later Monday by President Trump, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nThe investment would be used to build out cutting-edge chip-making facilities. Such an expansion would advance a long-pursued U.S. goal to regrow the domestic semiconductor industry after manufacturing fled largely to Asian countries in recent decades.\n\nTSMC, the world\u2019s largest contract chip-maker, set down roots in Arizona in 2020, when it said it would build a chip factory there for $12 billion. Its ambitions for the site have expanded rapidly since, with two more factories on the same site and a total investment of $65 billion. The company\u2019s first factory began mass production late last year.\n\nTSMC\u2019s announcement comes after years of deliberation regarding the future of semiconductor manufacturing in the U.S. and the global tech sector. The company currently builds its most advanced chip-making facilities only on its home soil Taiwan. The chips it produces are critical for powering everything from the latest artificial-intelligence systems to smartphones.\n\nSince the Biden administration, the U.S. has expressed concerns about TSMC\u2019s near-monopoly on advanced chip manufacturing and has been urging the company to relocate more of its cutting-edge production, including advanced chip-packaging facilities, to the U.S. Advanced chip packaging is particularly critical for AI-related chips, as it enhances performance by integrating multiple semiconductor components, reducing size, improving power efficiency, and ensuring faster data transfer\u2014key factors for AI applications.\n\n[awarded up to $6.6 billion of grants](https://www.wsj.com/tech/taiwanese-chip-making-giant-tsmc-gets-6-6-billion-for-arizona-project-f75e9de4?mod=article_inline), and has recently begun to receive federal money from the program. Generous tax credits have also boosted chip-making projects in the U.S.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re pleased to have an opportunity to meet with the President and look forward to discussing our shared vision for innovation and growth in the semiconductor industry, as well as exploring ways to bolster the technology sector along with our customers,\u201d TSMC said in a statement.\n\nU.S. officials see chip-making as a national-security imperative because economies, technological advancement and military might all are increasingly dependent on who has the best chips. Covid-era supply-chain issues also highlighted the critical nature of the industry when shortages of chips led to slowdowns in auto sales, among other disruptions.\n\nTrump has repeatedly called for more chip manufacturing in the U. S.\u2014although he criticized the Chips Act on the campaign trail and argued the better way to attract manufacturing was through tariffs. Last month, he said he was considering a 25% or more tariff on semiconductor imports.\n\n\u201cWe have to have chips made in this country. Right now, everything is made in Taiwan, practically, almost all of it, a little bit in South Korea, but everything\u2014almost all of it is made in Taiwan. And we want it to be made\u2014we want those companies to come to our country, in all due respect,\u201d Trump said in February.\n\nSince taking office, Trump has appeared at the White House with the chief executives of several companies to announce pledges to invest in the U.S. The details of the projects are often vague and it is often unclear whether the pledges represent\u00a0[new investments by the companies](https://www.wsj.com/tech/apple-corporate-new-job-investment-what-to-expect-ad19993c?mod=article_inline).\n\nOpenAI\u2019s\u00a0Sam Altman, database company\u00a0[Oracle](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/ORCL)\u00a0and investment giant\u00a0[SoftBank Group](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/JP/XTKS/9984)\u00a0pledged to invest as much as $500 billion into building artificial-intelligence infrastructure in the U.S., though Trump adviser\u00a0[Elon Musk](https://www.wsj.com/topics/person/elon-musk)\u00a0has questioned whether the project would come to fruition.\n\nLast week,\u00a0[Apple](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/AAPL)\u00a0said it plans to\u00a0[spend more than $500 billion](https://www.wsj.com/tech/apple-500-billion-investment-us-19ca11a0?mod=article_inline)\u00a0over the next four years to expand its manufacturing footprint in the U.S.\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/tech/trump-chip-maker-tsmc-expected-to-announce-100-billion-investment-in-u-s-02a44399?mod=hp_lead_pos6",

Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average were also flat.\n*****\n> Futures were trading in step with Nvidia in the premarket, with both trading off their highs during the session. Nvidia added around 2% after suffering a nearly 17% decline on Monday, which resulted in a market cap loss of nearly $600 billion \u2014 the biggest one-day drop for a U.S. company in history. Broadcom and Oracle also traded higher by more than 2% and around 1%, respectively.\n*****\n> Concerns over DeepSeek came to a head on Monday, with the Nasdaq Composite losing more than 3%, while the S&P 500 slid about 1.5%. The Chinese startup last month unveiled a free open-source large language model that it says took less than $6 million to build. The development spurred worries around Big Tech\u2019s investment into AI. DeepSeek surpassed rival OpenAI on Monday to become the most-downloaded free app in the U.S. on Apple\u2019s App Store.\n*****\n> \u201cValuations remain extended, and while vulnerabilities were expected this year, developments like DeepSeek highlight the need for diversification beyond the Mag Seven,\u201d said Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management. \u201cThe 2025 theme of US exceptionalism is now facing uncertainty, with ongoing concerns around tariffs and inflation adding to market challenges.\u201d\n*****\n> Investors\u2019 attention is turning toward corporate earnings due this week. Starbucks is due to report Tuesday after the bell. A slate of Magnificent Seven companies will report in the coming days, with Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Tesla and Apple due later this week.\n*****\n> The Federal Reserve will also kick off its two-day policy meeting on Tuesday. Fed funds futures are pricing in a more than 99% chance that interest rates will remain unchanged, according to CMEGroup\u2019s FedWatch Tool. Inflation data out Friday will give investors further insight on the health of the U.S. economy.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/WwQ6dQl.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx?t=sec_all)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S S&P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/0wLyJjd.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/o8CAqMY.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/8qU5X7B.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/modWclv.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/gzhgYxd.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/BFoktB0.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/vr9VBwI.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS AFTERNOON'S AFTER-HOURS EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/vZfpr7s.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/LZ4VMb2.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/hu1ZLPU.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/MQWygLA.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/2Jf3zi2.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/gbkVQno.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/28/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-premarket-nvda-orcl-jblu-gm.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n> **Nvidia** \u2014 The artificial intelligence darling bounced back about 3% after plunging 17% a day earlier.

    "selftext": ">The administration of U.S. President Donald Trump is working on a plan to save TikTok that involves tapping software company Oracle and a group of outside investors to effectively take control of the app's global operations, National Public Radio reported on Saturday.\n\n>\n\n>Under the deal being negotiated by the White House, TikTok's China-based owner, ByteDance, would retain a minority stake in the company, but the app's algorithm, data collection and software updates would be overseen by Oracle, which already provides the foundation of TikTok's Web infrastructure, NPR reported.\n\n>\n\n>The NPR report cited two people with knowledge of the talks. The White House and Oracle had no immediate comment.\n\n>\n\n>The short video app used by 170 million Americans was taken offline temporarily for users shortly before a law that said it must be sold by its Chinese owner ByteDance on national security grounds, or be banned, took effect on Jan. 19.\n\n>\n\n>Trump, after taking office a day later, signed an executive order seeking to delay by 75 days the enforcement of the law that was put in place after U.S. officials warned that under ByteDance, there was a risk of Americans' data being misused.\n\n>\n\n>The possible deal reported by NPR would mean that American investors would own a majority stake in TikTok. However, the report added that the terms of the deal could change and are still being hammered out.\n\n>\n\n>\"The goal is for Oracle to effectively monitor and provide oversight with what is going on with TikTok,\" a person directly involved in the talks but not authorized to speak publicly was quoted as saying by NPR.\n\n>\n\n>\"ByteDance wouldn't completely go away, but it would minimize Chinese ownership.\"\n\n>\n\n>Other potential investors who are engaged in the talks include Microsoft, NPR reported.\n\n>\n\n>Officials from Oracle and the White House held a meeting on Friday about a potential deal, and another meeting has been scheduled for next week, NPR reported.\n\n>\n\n>Oracle was interested in a TikTok stake \"in the tens of billions,\" but the rest of the deal is in flux, the NPR report cited the source as saying.\n\n>\n\n>Trump has said he \"would like the United States to have a 50% ownership position in a joint venture\" in TikTok.\n\n>\n\n>NPR cited another source as saying that appeasing Congress is seen as a key hurdle by the White House.\n\n>\n\n>Free speech advocates have opposed TikTok's ban under a law passed by the U.S. Congress and signed by former President Joe Biden.\n\n>\n\n>The company says U.S. officials misstated its ties to China, arguing its content recommendation engine and user data are stored in the United States on cloud servers operated by Oracle while content moderation decisions that affect American users are also made in the U.S.\n\n**Thoughts:** There are a TON of entities/people who have been rumored to buy Tik Tok (off the top of my head I can list Elon Musk, META, Kevin O' Leary, Mr. Beast and an assortment of random PE firms, Perplexity AI, and now Larry Ellison/ORCL)- I assume that these entities and affiliated companies may be worth looking at and possibly taking a short position in if they've reacted strongly to Tiktok acquisition rumors in the past.\n\nLink: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/white-house-talks-oracle-us-224145962.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/white-house-talks-oracle-us-224145962.html)",

    "title": "Super Micro Computer- SMCI $26 - Avoid Till We Get Restated Financials",
    "selftext": "**I think Super Micro Computer, (SMCI) should be avoided for the following reasons:**\n\n**Restatements could alter the financials significantly:**\u00a0The odds are high that the company will end up restating past financials. The Auditor\u2019s resignation, its CEO\u2019s pay package, and its past settlement with the SEC in 2018 all suggest that SMCI will have to restate its financial statements.\n\n**No 10K:**\u00a0SMCI has delayed its annual 10-K filing and without an audited 10K, we have precious little faith in the numbers.\u00a0\n\n**SMCI has priors:**\u00a0This was not their first time. In 2018, the company settled charges with the\u00a0[SEC for improper accounting](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2020-190). As stated in the article from the SEC website\u2026.\n\n>\n\n**Tainted:**\u00a0To me the alleged malfeasance creates significant doubts for investors that will not go away for a while, and it's very likely that Wall Street will not touch it, fearing liability for not doing enough due diligence. Also, I can\u2019t imagine SMCI getting a decent multiple in the future for the same reasons until faith is restored in management and its books.\n\n**Possible Loan Default:**\u00a0 There is a significant risk of Super Micro defaulting on the company's Term Loan Agreement with Bank of America.\u00a0\n\n**Compensation tied to aggressive revenue targets**: The CEO\u2019s unusual compensation package, with virtually no base salary and bonuses tied to very aggressive revenue and share price targets, is a dangerous and potentially abusive practice.\n\n**Possible delisting from the Nasdaq, and getting thrown out of the S&P 500**: The chances of both are high as a new auditor needs to be found, and a substantial amount of restatement work needs to be done.\n\n**A great business:**\u00a0Sure, SMCI has a great server liquid cooling business, which has tremendous potential and demand for server racks for AI GPUs, right now and for the foreseeable future. However, as we saw Nvidia has already started shifting this business.\n\n**Ignore the low valuation:**\u00a0I\u2019m going to ignore the current low valuation of 8x earnings and 0.5x sales, which are much lower than competitors such as Dell (DELL) and Oracle (ORCL), simply because I have no idea what the restated financials will look like, and the valuation could be a lot different\n\nThe only way I would invest is the possibility of a merger/acquisition/White Knight, that will keep the stock afloat. The CEO owns close to 10% of the company so I doubt if he would let this go without a fight.\n\nThe other problem I foresee is the difficulty of getting good and timely information. For the most part, we rely on analysts who expect a proper set of books. Instead of focusing on the fundamentals, we\u2019ll be spending far too much time, and worse without success trying to figure out what is genuine or not, It would make better sense to invest in other GPU/semiconductor businesses.

    "selftext": "#Good Friday morning traders and investors of the r/stocks sub! Welcome to the final trading day of the week. Here are your pre-market movers & news on this Friday, September the 13th, 2024-\n\n*****\n\n#[Stock futures rise after S&P 500 notches fourth-straight winning session: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/12/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)\n\n*****\n> U.S. stock futures rose Friday as traders sought to shake off a sluggish September.\n*****\n> S&P 500 futures climbed about 0.2% and Nasdaq 100 futures hovered above flat. Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 45 points, or 0.1%.\n*****\n> The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite are coming off their fourth straight winning session, adding to their strong week-to-date performances. The broad market index is up nearly 3.5% this week, while the Nasdaq has popped 5.3%. The Dow has advanced 1.9%.\n*****\n> Wall Street is now looking ahead toward the Federal Reserve\u2019s policy meeting on Sept. 17-18, where the central bank is largely anticipated to lower interest rates by 25 basis points. Currently, the Fed\u2019s target rate is sitting at 5.25% to 5.5%.\n*****\n> Economic data reflecting a moderation in inflation also seemed to support the case for a rate cut. The consumer price index in August came in at 2.5% on annualized basis, the lowest level since February 2021. Wholesale prices, meanwhile, rose 0.2% in August, coming in line with expectations.\n*****\n> \u201cAt the end of the day, the U.S. consumer and the economy continue to do well, [and] profits continue to print above expectations,\u201d Dan Greenhaus, chief strategist at Solus Alternative Asset Management, said on CNBC\u2019s \u201cClosing Bell\u201d on Thursday. \u201cAnd so while we had a meaningful sell-off driven by some of those AI names, for sure, the rebound seems entirely justified because it doesn\u2019t seem like these issues are broadening out,\u201d he added.\n*****\n> On the economic front, traders will look toward August\u2019s import prices data Friday morning. Preliminary consumer sentiment figures for September are also scheduled for release.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n# YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/qdMr2UM.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n# TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S S&P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/kRM5YO4.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/6RGo5gO.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MONTH'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MONTH'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/SbRYe6l.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#NEXT WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/msn8zDR.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#NEXT WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/HMsNmom.jpeg)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/Dmxsn1A.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/bEc6ZgH.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS AFTERNOON'S AFTER-HOURS EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/QJqdavB.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES!]()**)\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES!](https://i.imgur.com/QvFDTFL.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/MnPxM87.png)**)\n(N/A.)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR!]()**)\n(N/A.)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/13/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-premarket-ba-orcl-mrna-and-more.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n> **Boeing** \u2014 The stock sank 4% after Boeing factory workers went on strike early Friday after rejecting a new labor contract.

    "title": "Oracle trails only Nvidia among large-cap tech this year, as Ellison closes in on Bezos",
    "selftext": "Larry Ellison\u00a0turned 80 last month. It\u2019s been a celebratory year.\n\nWhile fellow legacy tech players\u00a0Intel\u00a0and\u00a0Cisco\u00a0struggle to find their footing in a world driven increasingly by the promise of artificial intelligence, Oracle has emerged as a Wall Street darling.\n\nFollowing a better-than-expected\u00a0[earnings report](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/09/oracle-orcl-q1-earnings-report-2025.html)\u00a0after the close on Monday, the stock popped 11% on Tuesday. It gained more steam on Wednesday, closing at a record $157.10. Oracle has seen double-digit gains following each of its three quarterly reports this year, driven by the company\u2019s cloud businesses. The stock didn\u2019t have a single double-digit increase last year and had only one in 2022.\n\n\u201cThe excitement is back,\u201d Guggenheim analysts titled their post-earnings report, highlighting \u201cmomentum across all business.\u201d\n\nOracle shares are now up 49% this year, trailing only AI chipmaker\u00a0Nvidia\u00a0\u2014 up 136% \u2014 among large-cap tech stocks. The next best performer in the group is\u00a0Meta, which has gained 45%.\n\nIntel, meanwhile, has lost 60% of its value and Cisco is down almost 3%. Both companies announced\u00a0major layoffs\u00a0in their\u00a0earnings reports\u00a0last month.\n\nThe biggest financial winner from Oracle\u2019s rally is Ellison, who founded the software company in 1977 and remains chairman. He owns over 40% of the outstanding stock and has seen his net worth swell to $192 billion, according to\u00a0Forbes. Only\u00a0Tesla\u00a0CEO\u00a0Elon Musk\u00a0($251 billion) and Amazon founder\u00a0Jeff Bezos\u00a0($202 billion) are wealthier.\n\nBy the standards of high-growth tech, Oracle remains fairly plodding.\n\nRevenue increased 8% in the latest quarter from a year earlier to $13.31 billion. For the current period, growth is expected to be between 8% and 10%, CEO Safra Catz said on the earnings call.\n\nSince 2011, Oracle has had only one year of double-digit revenue growth \u2014 18% in fiscal 2023 \u2014 and four times the company has contracted.\n\n\u201cAfter 13 years of single-digit organic total revenue growth, Oracle is reaccelerating into the double digits,\u201d JMP analysts wrote in a note on Tuesday, bumping up their rating to buy from hold. \u201cWe remain very EPS confident and committed to full-year total revenue growth growing double digits.\u201d\n\nOracle is currently in the midst of its\u00a0CloudWorld\u00a0conference, which wraps up on Thursday in Las Vegas. Between the earnings report and the annual event, investors are applauding the company\u2019s cloud story, including both its infrastructure business and its databases.\n\nWhile Oracle is still way behind Amazon Web Services,\u00a0Microsoft\u00a0and\u00a0Google\u00a0in terms of cloud infrastructure market share, the business has turned into a big growth driver for the company. Revenue in the unit surged 45% in the quarter from a year earlier to $2.2 billion.\n\nIn addition to competing with the top cloud companies, Oracle is increasingly partnering with them.\n\nA year ago, Ellison\u00a0visited Microsoft\u2019s headquarters\u00a0outside of Seattle for the first time, announcing a collaboration with a company he\u2019d competed with for more than 30 years.\n\nOn Monday, Oracle said its database software will become available for AWS customers to use atop Oracle hardware sitting inside of Amazon data centers. Oracle has forged such arrangements with all three major cloud infrastructure vendors in the past year.\n\n\u201cWe believe our cloud partnerships with AWS and Microsoft and Google will turbocharge the growth of our database business for years to come,\u201d Ellison said on Monday\u2019s earnings call.\n\nOracle didn\u2019t immediately provide a comment for this story.\n\n# \u2018No more passwords\u2019\n\nFor years, Ellison described Oracle\u2019s database as \u201cautonomous,\u201d playing into the hype around self-driving cars (he used to be on Tesla\u2019s board and is close with Musk) and the emergence of AI. Its product wouldn\u2019t need manual patching and wouldn\u2019t have downtime, and Ellison said no other cloud provider could do it. But of late he\u2019s benefitted from playing nice.\n\nAfter years of\u00a0criticizing AWS\u00a0at events, Ellison decided to ensure that clients are able to use Amazon\u2019s market-leading cloud with Oracle\u2019s full-featured database.\n\n\u201cOf course, customers have been able to use Oracle inside of AWS for a long time,\u201d AWS CEO Matt Garman told CNBC in a recent interview. But the new offering will allow clients to easily sign up in the AWS marketplace of third-party software, make backups and move data to AWS analytics tools, Garman said.\n\nGarman, who\u00a0replaced\u00a0Adam Selipsky as AWS CEO in June, added that clients had been asking the two companies to figure out how to work more closely together.\n\nAs Ellison digs deeper into AI and enters his 81st year on the planet, he\u2019s now taking on passwords, which he calls \u201cutterly ridiculous\u201d because they\u2019re insecure and can be \u201ceasily hacked.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is the way log-on is going to work,\u201d Ellison said on the earnings call. \u201cI\u2019m going to type in Larry.Ellison@oracle.com, the computer is going to look at me and say, \u2018OK, Hi Larry.\u2019 We\u2019re done.\u201d\n\nHe went on to say that Catz can recognize him as can his kids, so there\u2019s no reason his computer shouldn\u2019t be able to the same.\n\n\u201cNo more passwords,\u201d he said. \u201cThose have got to go.\u201d\n\nSource: [https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/11/oracle-trails-only-nvidia-among-large-cap-tech-in-2024-ellison-wins.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/11/oracle-trails-only-nvidia-among-large-cap-tech-in-2024-ellison-wins.html)",

Here are your pre-market stock movers & news on this Tuesday, September the 10th, 2024-\n\n*****\n\n# [Stock futures are flat as September sluggishness continues, traders await inflation data: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/09/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)\n\n*****\n> Stock futures were mostly flat Tuesday after the major averages rebounded from their worst week in 2024.\n*****\n> Futures tied to the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures each added about 0.1%. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures dipped 16 points, or less than 0.1%.\n*****\n> Cloud platform company Oracle surged about 8% after posting fiscal first-quarter results that topped expectations. Oracle also announced a partnership with Amazon Web Services to provide database services.\n*****\n> On Monday, the three major averages made a sharp comeback after posting their worst week this year as investors bought the dip. The S&P 500 popped 1.16% to snap a four-day run of losses and post its first winning day in September. The Nasdaq Composite also closed 1.16% higher, aided by a jump in Nvidia. The Dow climbed 484 points, or 1.2%.\n*****\n> These moves come as investors bet that a widely anticipated interest rate cut at the Federal Reserve\u2019s Sept. 17-18 meeting could help assuage concerns over a weakening economy. August\u2019s payrolls report, which came out last Friday, reflected growth of 142,000, below economists\u2019 expectations.

    "selftext": "Oracle shares rose 9% in extended trading on Monday after the database software vendor reported fiscal first-quarter results that topped Wall Street estimates.\n\nHere is how the company did compared to LSEG consensus:\n\nEarnings per share: $1.39 adjusted vs. $1.32 expected\n\nRevenue: $13.31 billion vs. $13.23 billion expected\n\nOracle\u2019s revenue increased 8% from $12.45 billion a year ago, according to a statement. Net income rose to $2.93 billion, or $1.03 per share, from $2.42 billion, or 86 cents per share, in the same quarter a year ago.\n\nAt its after-hours price of about $153, Oracle is on pace to reach a record on Tuesday. The stock\u2019s highest close to date was $145.03 in July. Prior to the report, Oracle was up about 34% so far this year, compared to the S&P 500\u2032s 15% gain.\n\nFor the current quarter, Oracle expects revenue growth of 8 to 10%, CEO Safra Catz said on the earnings call. Analysts were expecting growth of close to 9%, according to LSEG. The company sees adjusted earnings per share for the fiscal second quarter of 1.45 to $1.49. Analysts were looking for earnings of $1.47 per share.\n\nThe company said its cloud services and license support business generated $10.52 billion in revenue. That was up 10% from a year earlier and higher than the StreetAccount consensus of $10.47 billion.\n\nOracle\u2019s cloud and on-premises license segment had $870 million in revenue, up 7%, and more than StreetAccount\u2019s $757.6 billion consensus.\n\nRevenue from cloud infrastructure came to $2.2 billion, up 45%. That is an acceleration from the prior quarter, during which revenue went up 42%.\n\n\u201cDemand continued to outstrip supply\u201d of consumption-based cloud infrastructure, Catz said on the call.\n\nDuring the quarter, Oracle announced the opening of a second cloud region in Saudi Arabia and said its database software will be available through Google\u2019s public cloud.\n\nIn a separate statement on Monday, Oracle said it would partner with cloud infrastructure market leader Amazon Web Services to enable its database services on dedicated hardware.\n\nExecutives will issue guidance and discuss the results with analysts on a conference call starting at 5 p.m. ET.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/09/oracle-orcl-q1-earnings-report-2025.html",

    "title": "Analyzing the Analysts: Using average analyst price target to identify buying opportunities amongst the top 100 companies in the S&P",
    "selftext": "Hello everyone,\n\nI'm a lazy investor and don't like to do much due diligence, but I do like to make money. Unfortunately these two things about me are often at odds as I've lost money in the past for not doing my DD. As such, I continue to be lazy but I try and find ways to work around doing due diligence and hopefully finding loop holes.\n\nOne such way that I have been thinking about recently is using analyst ratings, reviews and price targets as a surrogate for due diligence. In essence, I try to just have these analysts do the work for me. The idea is that much in the same way that with those who believe in technical analysis hold that everything you need to know about a stock is baked into it's price action, and so when something good happens the stock price goes up and when something bad happens the stock price goes down, thus all you need is to analyze trends in stock price and you'll be analyzing everything about the stock by proxy, I have a thesis (or theory) that perhaps you can do the same or something similar with analyst price targets of companies.\n\nNow I know that anyone who has read this far already thinks I'm an idiot. Many experienced individual investors probably find market analysts to be stupid and therefore I'm stupid for following their lead, but I would argue to the contrary for a few reasons. As much as I have put in a lot of effort to learn about how the market operates (been investing for the last 6 years, started learning actively about it as much as I could a couple years prior to that), there is still much I don't know as I don't have a finance or economics degree. Moreover, as bad as you may think an analyst is, they are at least competent enough to keep their job as an analyst at the investment firm that allows them to make stock price target selections. Lastly, and most importantly, what I am about to discuss below uses the aggregate of numerous analyst price targets so I'm not relying on a single analyst, but several (probably between 10 and 40 per company). I think if two-dozen analysts are strongly in favor of a company, it is unlikely that my novice investor wisdom would have researched the company and found a flaw that they all missed.\n\nSo what I did yesterday evening was go through the top 100 S&P 500 companies by market cap and find the current average price target for them on Yahoo Finance. I then divided the current stock price (at the close on 7/31) by that price target and expressed it as a percentage to see how far off the company was from the average price target analysts were aiming for. Then I also listed how many total ratings each company had, and how many of them were 'Strong Buys' and 'Buys'.\n\nThis yielded the following table:\n\n|+|A|B|C|D|E|F|G|H|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|1|Company|Current Price|Price Target|Percent to Target|Total Ratings|# Strong Buy Ratings|# Buy Ratings|% of Ratings that were Strong Buys|\n|2|AAPL|222.08|209.76|105.87%|38|11|21|28.95%|\n|3|MSFT|418.35|459.66|91.01%|34|14|13|41.18%|\n|4|NVDA|117.02|125.69|93.10%|38|14|15|36.84%|\n|5|AMZN|186.98|206.43|90.58%|47|15|28|31.91%|\n|6|META|474.83|490.04|96.90%|63|21|34|33.33%|\n|7|GOOG|173.15|185.45|93.37%|5|0|3|0.00%|\n|8|BRK.B|438.5|441.47|99.33%|6|1|3|16.67%|\n|9|LLY|804.27|817.03|98.44%|22|9|8|40.91%|\n|10|AVGO|160.68|180.62|88.96%|29|10|17|34.48%|\n|11|JPM|212.8|200.66|106.05%|28|9|13|32.14%|\n|12|TSLA|232.07|189.09|122.73%|23|0|0|0.00%|\n|13|UNH|576.16|569.6|101.15%|22|11|11|50.00%|\n|14|XOM|118.59|122.83|96.55%|25|5|11|20.00%|\n|15|V|265.67|282.26|94.12%|39|13|22|33.33%|\n|16|JNJ|157.85|158.53|99.57%|23|4|8|17.39%|\n|17|PG|160.76|161.5|99.54%|22|6|4|27.27%|\n|18|MA|463.71|474.87|97.65%|39|14|20|35.90%|\n|19|HD|368.16|355.97|103.42%|33|12|12|36.36%|\n|20|COST|822|886.84|92.69%|29|7|11|24.14%|\n|21|WMT|68.64|68.29|100.51%|32|8|7|25.00%|\n|22|MRK|113.13|132.14|85.61%|21|4|7|19.05%|\n|23|BAC|40.31|41.95|96.09%|30|6|16|20.00%|\n|24|CVX|160.47|167.84|95.61%|24|6|10|25.00%|\n|25|NFLX|628.35|640.43|98.11%|41|11|14|26.83%|\n|26|KO|66.74|64.8|102.99%|25|5|7|20.00%|\n|27|CRM|258.8|274.18|94.39%|45|16|25|35.56%|\n|28|ADBE|551.65|566.58|97.36%|31|11|14|35.48%|\n|29|PEP|172.67|168.65|102.38%|22|10|10|45.45%|\n|30|TMO|613.34|629.42|97.45%|15|8|6|53.33%|\n|31|AMD|144.48|175.48|82.33%|31| | |0.00%|\n|32|LIN|453.5|475.32|95.41%| | | |#DIV/0!|\n|33|ORCL|139.45|140.03|99.59%|36|10|16|27.78%|\n|34|WFC|59.34|59.8|99.23%|31|4|8|12.90%|\n|35|ACN|330.62|348.01|95.00%|29|7|9|24.14%|\n|36|CSCO|48.45|50.56|95.83%|27|8|11|29.63%|\n|37|MCD|265.4|276.47|96.00%|33|8|15|24.24%|\n|38|QCOM|180.95|191.24|94.62%|23|2|7|8.70%|\n|39|GE|170.2|171.93|98.99%|17|5| |29.41%|\n|40|ABT|105.94|124.37|85.18%|20|7|6|35.00%|\n|41|TXN|203.81|187.18|108.88%|32|6|8|18.75%|\n|42|DHR|277.08|284.09|97.53%|17|7|6|41.18%|\n|43|AMGN|332.47|320.24|103.82%|25|3|7|12.00%|\n|44|INTU|647.35|711.36|91.00%|22|6|3|27.27%|\n|45|PM|115.16|115.74|99.50%|18|2|7|11.11%|\n|46|PFE|30.54|29.38|103.95%|22|2|11|9.09%|\n|47|IBM|192.14|172.59|111.33%|25|4|4|16.00%|\n|48|DIS|93.69|123.11|76.10%|30|5|10|16.67%|\n|49|VZ|40.52|45.6|88.86%|32|2|6|6.25%|\n|50|CAT|346.2|337.62|102.54%|24|4|7|16.67%|\n|51|NOW|814.39|807.1|100.90%|34|13|17|38.24%|\n|52|AMAT|212.2|248.8|85.29%|21|4|15|19.05%|\n|53|GS|509.03|476.64|106.80%|27|4|7|14.81%|\n|54|CMCSA|41.27|46.36|89.02%|31|12|18|38.71%|\n|55|SPGI|484.73|521.39|92.97%|15|1|9|6.67%|\n|56|RTX|117.49|103.93|113.05%| | | |#DIV/0!|\n|57|ISRG|444.61|471.87|94.22%|17|6|5|35.29%|\n|58|NEE|76.39|80.23|95.21%|15|5|8|33.33%|\n|59|UNP|246.73|242.11|101.91%|29|5|7|17.24%|\n|60|AXP|253.04|253.26|99.91%|28|6|4|21.43%|\n|61|LOW|245.51|250.99|97.82%|32|8|10|25.00%|\n|62|T|19.25|19.3|99.74%|30|6|3|20.00%|\n|63|HON|204.75|226.96|90.21%|20|7|9|35.00%|\n|64|UBER|64.47|79.96|80.63%| | | |#DIV/0!|\n|65|VRTX|495.72|483.91|102.44%|27|10|12|37.04%|\n|66|MS|103.21|105.64|97.70%|27|3|14|11.11%|\n|67|TJX|113.02|107.04|105.59%|27|9|14|33.33%|\n|68|INTC|30.74|38.02|80.85%|41| |18|0.00%|\n|69|BKNG|3715.01|4192.39|88.61%| | | |#DIV/0!|\n|70|PGR|214.12|237.47|90.17%|19|5|4|26.32%|\n|71|C|64.88|71.01|91.37%|29|5|12|17.24%|\n|72|ELV|532.03|599.13|88.80%| | | |#DIV/0!|\n|73|BLK|876.5|936.85|93.56%|15|3|9|20.00%|\n|74|PLD|126.05|135.68|92.90%|18|4|8|22.22%|\n|75|LMT|541.92|535.31|101.23%|22|7| |31.82%|\n|76|ETN|304.79|345.86|88.13%|24|3|4|12.50%|\n|77|REGN|1079.19|1104.34|97.72%|26|7|6|26.92%|\n|78|MU|109.82|174.41|62.97%|31|8|20|25.81%|\n|79|CB|275.66|277.84|99.22%|19|5|11|26.32%|\n|80|SYK|327.45|378.81|86.44%|27|11|6|40.74%|\n|81|ADI|231.38|255.84|90.44%|26|6|10|23.08%|\n|82|LRCX|921.24|1041.75|88.43%|19|3|12|15.79%|\n|83|MMC|222.57|223.48|99.59%|19|4|7|21.05%|\n|84|BSX|73.88|87.57|84.37%|24|10|8|41.67%|\n|85|MDT|80.32|92.43|86.90%|23|4|7|17.39%|\n|86|BA|190.6|219.35|86.89%|25|7|7|28.00%|\n|87|ADP|262.62|264.65|99.23%|18|1|1|5.56%|\n|88|AMT|220.4|230.39|95.66%|22|7|14|31.82%|\n|89|PANW|324.73|343.43|94.55%|41|13|16|31.71%|\n|90|KLAC|823.07|868.07|94.82%|14|2|4|14.29%|\n|91|BX|142.15|135.47|104.93%|14|6|6|42.86%|\n|92|CI|348.67|393.25|88.66%|17|6|7|35.29%|\n|93|BMY|47.56|50.47|94.23%|22|5|4|22.73%|\n|94|GILD|76.06|81.02|93.88%|28|2|11|7.14%|\n|95|SCHW|65.19|73.89|88.23%|19|5|9|26.32%|\n|96|DE|371.98|422.99|87.94%|22|4|3|18.18%|\n|97|FI|163.57|177.14|92.34%|19|1|2|5.26%|\n|98|UPS|130.37|144.61|90.15%|26|3|2|11.54%|\n|99|SO|83.52|79.51|105.04%|17|1|4|5.88%|\n|100|TMUS|182.28|197.95|92.08%|30|7|16|23.33%|\n|101|COP|111.2|141.51|78.58%|21|6|9|28.57%|\n\n\nBased on this table above, I tried to identify some companies that met a few criteria. I wanted to identify companies that had at least 25% of their analyst ratings be 'Strong Buys', to have at least 20 analyst ratings available and for the current stock price to be at 90% or less of the average price target. This lead me to the following 11 companies:\n**Micron Technologies (MU), Boston Scientific (BSX), Abbot Laboratories (ABT), Merck Scientific (MRK), Stryker (SYK), The Cigna Group (CI), Broadcom (AVGO), Comcast (CMCSA), Honeywell International (HON), Analogue Devices (ADI), and Intuit Inc. (INTU)**\n\nI have about $5,000 I'd like to invest right now and I have half a mind to just put it equally weighted into these 11 companies and just watch it for the next year or two. I'll either do that or put it all in VOO, but I have a feeling that these 11 companies might beat the S&P 500 over the next 24 months.\n\nWhat do you guys think?",

    "selftext": "Oracle shares moved 9% higher in extended trading on Tuesday after the company announced cloud deals with Google and OpenAI, despite fourth-quarter results that fell short of Wall Street expectations.\n\nHere\u2019s how the company did compared with LSEG consensus:\n\nEarnings per share: $1.63 adjusted vs. $1.65 expected\n\nRevenue: $14.29 billion, vs. $14.55 billion expected\n\nOracle\u2019s revenue increased 3% year over year during the quarter, which ended on May 31, according to a statement. Net income, at $3.14 billion, or $1.11 per share, was down from $3.32 billion, or $1.19 per share, in the year-ago quarter.\n\nThe cloud services and license support segment generated $10.23 billion in revenue, up 9% and slightly below the StreetAccount consensus of $10.29 billion.\n\nThe company\u2019s cloud and on-premises licenses business contributed $1.84 billion in revenue. That\u2019s down 15% and lower than the $2.09 billion StreetAccount consensus.\n\nCloud infrastructure revenue came to $2.0 billion, up 42%, which was a deceleration from the 49% growth rate in the prior quarter. The cloud business remains smaller than rivals Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure but is growing faster.\n\nOracle said in a statement on Tuesday that it would bring its database to Google\u2019s cloud, with availability coming in November. In an additional statement, Oracle said OpenAI has selected the Oracle public cloud to extend Microsoft\u2019s AI infrastructure.\n\nDuring the quarter, Oracle said its database software would be available in five additional Microsoft Azure data center regions, bringing the total to 15. Oracle also announced generative artificial intelligence features coming to its Fusion cloud applications for supply chain and human resources.\n\nNotwithstanding the after-hours move, Oracle stock has gained 18% so far this year, while the S&P 500 index is up about 13% over the same period.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/11/oracle-orcl-q4-earnings-report-2024.html",

    "selftext": "#Good morning traders and investors of the r/stocks sub! Welcome to the new trading day and a fresh start! Here are your stock market news and movers on this Tuesday, March the 12th, 2024-\n\n*****\n\n# [S&P 500 futures tick higher as all eyes are on key inflation reading: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/11/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)\n\n*****\n> S&P 500 futures rose slightly Tuesday as investors await a key inflation report that could inform the path of the Federal Reserve\u2019s monetary policy.\n*****\n> S&P 500 futures inched up 0.2%, and Nasdaq-100 futures gained about 0.4%. Futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average hovered near the flatline.\n*****\n> All eyes are on the February reading of the consumer price index, which is set to be released Tuesday at 8:30 a.m. ET. Economists polled by Dow Jones forecast a monthly gain of 0.4% and a 3.1% year-over-year increase on headline.\n*****\n> The uptick in January\u2019s CPI figure rattled the markets and prompted Fed officials to shift their rhetoric afterward to a more cautious tone about easing policy. The current market pricing indicates that the Fed won\u2019t cut interest rates at its meeting on March 19-20 or the one on April 30 to May 1.\n*****\n> \u201cThe CPI index likely ran hot in February on higher gasoline prices, but core inflation likely slowed further as car prices fell and rent increases moderated,\u201d said Bill Adams, chief economist at Comerica Bank.\n*****\n> The technology-led market rally has lost momentum as of late as some of the biggest winners this year retreat.

S&P 500 futures oscillated near the flat line, and Nasdaq 100 futures inched higher by 0.2%.\n*****\n> The November consumer price index report is slated for release at 8:30 a.m. ET. Economists polled by Dow Jones expect prices were flat month over month. Year over year, CPI is expected to have risen 3.1%.\n*****\n> The report comes as investors try to end a strong year on a high note. The Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite are all riding three-day winning streaks and have six consecutive weeks of gains. The S&P 500 also closed at its highest level since March 2022, while the 30-stock Dow settled at its highest point since January 2022.\n*****\n> \u201cThe recent rally is based on hopes that a Goldilocks-type scenario lies ahead. Specifically, this would include softer economic growth (but no recession) and a substantial number of Fed rate cuts due to a continued sharp fall in inflation. Unfortunately, we believe much of the good news is discounted,\u201d Sameer Samana, senior global market strategist at the Wells Fargo Investment Institute, said in a note to clients Monday.\n*****\n> The report also precedes the Federal Reserve\u2019s final monetary policy announcement of the year, which is due Wednesday.\n*****\n> Shares of tech giant Oracle were down 7% in extended trading after the company\u2019s revenue for the fiscal second quarter missed Wall Street expectations.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/L5YsGBU.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx?t=sec_all)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S S&P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/0HdEE3i.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/PfMfhjW.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/RJ4YjC2.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/5C1obGW.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/mZnMgye.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/7Dku6aI.jpg)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/mOI2Q54.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS AFTERNOON'S AFTER-HOURS EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!]()**)\n(N/A.)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/AQSQGnm.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/baeqReU.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/fun4JYk.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/2PMGebf.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/EfV3BCx.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/kvmkG0G.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/i6MklzV.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/12/12/stocks-making-the-biggest-premarket-moves-.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n> **Hasbro** \u2014 The toymaker tumbled 5.5% after it said it was laying off about 1,100 workers.

    "selftext": "I went and looked for a few hundred ticker symbols of mega, large and mid cap - also a few small caps. Saw a few that are either retail or in a space that should do good as the holiday season approaches. Here are a few of them with why I bought: \n\nTGT \\[Target\\] = Target has its problems such as organized theft like most chain stores do. Target also has its base of customers that want to shop there and nowhere else. Looking the last 10 years over it usually performs well between September and January, about 70% of the time (some of its best runs came from fall - late winter). \n\nW \\[Wayfair\\] = Wayfair has its base of customers that are loyal to it. Although it had a boom and bust cycle from 2020 until now due to COVID restrictions going from being a thing to not anymore - I see this stock as a good play for the next 6 months. People are still moving (upper middle class) and finding new jobs, many that require relocation. People who helped pump W to go over 10X in 2020 are the same people who will buy things from them during the holiday season, if they move hundreds of miles away, etc. \n\nORCL \\[Oralce\\] = They are a powerhouse of a company - the small caps cannot compete, and I am unaware of a single company that I've used who has stopped using them to use another product. Seems oversold (for those who know about charts - it has a double top). [https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=ORCL&p=d](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=ORCL&p=d) \n\nNG \\[Novagold Resources Inc.\\] = The price of gold the last few weeks has plummeted 5%, and it has for no reason. A company that I like is NG and they report earnings next week. They have a multiple bottom in their charts for chart people. [https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NG&ty=c&p=d&b=1](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NG&ty=c&p=d&b=1) \n\nAMZN \\[Amazon\\] = No explanation needed, it's amazon. ",

    "title": "4 Tech stocks benefiting from the AI boom.",
    "selftext": "The world of artificial intelligence (AI) these days is overwhelmingly dominated by discussions on generative AI and its implications. Simply put, generative AI is a form of machine learning through which AI software can produce text, video, images, and more. Basically, generative AI can produce any form of content on the basis of prompts. This form of AI became more widespread and renowned after the launch of ChatGPT and similar generative AI platforms, which revolutionized the AI sector while pulling in major tech companies to become part of the AI race.\r  \n\r  \nThis form of AI and its impact on the markets was discussed by Jim Stewart, a New York Times columnist, on CNBC's 'Squawk on the Street' on June 16. According to Stewart, big tech companies, especially those that are AI beneficiaries, have been leading the recent stock market rally. These include companies such as Microsoft Corporation ($MSFT), Alphabet Inc. ($GOOG), and NVIDIA Corporation ($NVDA). Stewart claimed that he was bullish on AI, especially considering the fact that this technology could boost productivity gains across different fields, including journalism.\r  \n\r  \n**AI and the US Stock Market**\r  \nIn May, NVIDIA Corporation ($NVDA) joined the group of companies with valuations in trillions of dollars. Many financial professionals today are attributing the gains of the S&P 500 to AI, primarily, with the focus being on NVIDIA Corporation ($NVDA) and other big tech companies that have begun incorporating AI and generative AI in their products and services.\r  \n\r  \nThis overwhelming focus on a select few number of companies that can successfully play the AI boom and come out victorious has led to many investors worrying that the stock market in 2023 will turn into a selection of a few winners and a lot more losers. The S&P 500 has \"basically been the S&P 7,\" a reference to the fact that only seven major tech companies have been calling the shots so far in 2023, leading the market to heavily rely on them and their gains.\r  \n\r  \n**\"You Are At The Starting Line Of AI\"**\r  \nThis reality has led many professionals and corporations to realize that the AI boom is very real and may be here to stay. Companies today will be bound to figure out where they stand in this environment and how they can integrate AI into their business models to reap the benefits of this technological revolution. NVIDIA Corporation's ($NVDA) CEO, Jensen Huang, in an address at the National Taiwan University in May, stated that we are currently at \"the starting line of AI\" and that at this moment, we should run instead of walking. The implications of his statement are many, but perhaps the most obvious lesson to take away from Huang's speech is that companies and individuals today shouldn't be slow to join the AI race - they should try their best to become part of it and ensure they don't end up getting left behind by their competitors.\r  \n\r  \nKeeping the above-mentioned market dynamics and developments in mind, I have compiled a list of the top tech stocks to consider investing in to play the AI boom. I included the obvious stock picks because of their contributions to this industry so far, but I also attempted to find other companies that wouldn't be the first to come to your mind when looking at AI beneficiaries today. \n\n# Our Methodology\r\r\n\nTo select our stocks, I  looked at which companies analysts are expecting to benefit from the AI boom and shortlisted them based on the number of hedge funds holding stakes in them by using Insider Monkey's hedge fund data for the first quarter of 2023. The stocks are ranked based on this metric, from the lowest to the highest number of hedge funds long each of them.\n\n# Tech Stocks Benefiting From The AI Boom\n\n\r  \n**1. Oracle Corporation ($ORCL)**  \n\r  \nOn June 13, Keith Bachman at BMO Capital raised his price target on Oracle Corporation ($ORCL) from $96 to $132. The analyst also holds a Market Perform rating on the stock.\r  \n\r  \nOracle Corporation ($ORCL) is an information technology company based in Austin, Texas. The company's products and services address enterprise information technology environments across the world.\r  \n\r  \nI saw 67 hedge funds long Oracle Corporation ($ORCL) in the first quarter, with a total stake value of $2.9 billion.\r  \n\r  \nTD Cowen's John Blackledge expects Oracle Corporation ($ORCL) to benefit from the current AI boom because its cloud-computing platform can offer it some competitive advantages.\r  \n\r  \nFirst Eagle Investment Management held 20.7 million shares in Oracle Corporation ($ORCL) at the end of the first quarter, making it the largest shareholder in the company.\n\n**2. CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. ($CRWD)**\r  \n\r  \nCrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. ($CRWD) is an information technology company offering cybersecurity products and services. It is based in Austin, Texas.\r  \n\r  \nThere were 72 hedge funds holding stakes in CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. ($CRWD) at the end of the first quarter. Their total stake value in the company was $2.4 billion.\r  \n\r  \nCrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. ($CRWD) may be an interesting stock pick to play the AI boom considering the company has recently announced new AI-powered indicators of attack (IoA) models. These models can combat advanced adversary tradecraft by using machine intelligence to stop breaches.\r  \n\r  \nTal Liani at Bank of America holds a Buy rating on CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. ($CRWD) shares as of June 16. The analyst also raised the firm's price target on the stock from $162 to $190.\n\n**3. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. ($AMD)**\r  \n\r  \nAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc. ($AMD) was spotted in the portfolios of 91 hedge funds in the first quarter, with a total stake value of $4.9 billion.\r  \n\r  \nBased in Santa Clara, California, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. ($AMD) is a semiconductor company that operates globally.\r  \n\r  \nJoseph Moore, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, raised his price target on Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. ($AMD) shares on June 16 from $97 to $138. The analyst also holds an Overweight rating on the shares.\r  \n\r  \nAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc. ($AMD) is a chipmaker that TD Cowen's John Blackledge has picked as one of his tech stocks to play the AI boom. This is unsurprising considering the fact that this June, the company revealed its new AI chip in its race with NVIDIA Corporation ($NVDA). The new MI300X chip was described by Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. ($AMD) as \"the world's most advances accelerator for generative AI.\"\r  \n\r  \nCitadel Investment Group held 13.9 million shares in Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. ($AMD) at the end of the first quarter, making the fund the most prominent shareholder in the company for that quarter.\n\n**4. Adobe Inc. ($ADBE)**\r  \n\r  \nAdobe Inc. ($ADBE) is a diversified software and information technology company based in San Jose, California. The company's flagship product is its Creative Cloud, a subscription service offering members access to its creative products.\r  \n\r  \nJohn Blackledge at TD Cowen sees Adobe Inc. ($ADBE) as a smart AI play because the company has begun rolling out new generative-AI content creation tools.\r  \n\r  \nAn Outperform rating was reiterated on Adobe Inc. ($ADBE) shares on June 16 by Kirk Materne at Evercore ISI. The analyst also raised his price target on the stock from $475 to $590.\r  \n\r  \nA total of 99 hedge funds were long Adobe Inc. ($ADBE) in the first quarter, with a total stake value of $7.3 billion.\n\n**4. Apple Inc. ($AAPL)**\r  \n\r  \nApple Inc. ($AAPL) may not be the first big tech company that comes to your mind when looking for AI plays, but with the company's new Vision Pro headset, some believe it may be getting involved in the machine learning space more than before.\r  \n\r  \nAnalysts at Bernstein hold a Market Perform rating and a $175 price target on Apple Inc. ($AAPL) shares as of June 14.\r  \n\r  \nOur hedge fund data for the first quarter shows 131 hedge funds long Apple Inc. ($AAPL). Their total stake value was $165 billion.\r  \n\r  \nHolding 915.6 million shares in the company, Berkshire Hathaway was the largest stakeholder in Apple Inc. ($AAPL) at the end of the first quarter.",

    "selftext": "#Good Friday morning traders and investors of the r/stocks sub! Welcome to the final trading day of this week. Here are your pre-market movers & news this AM-\n\n*****\n\n#[Dow futures fall following Thursday\u2019s market selloff fueled by banks, U.S. jobs report looms](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/09/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)\n\n*****\n> Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell Friday as investors look to upcoming job data for clues into how the Federal Reserve may move forward. The action follows a steep sell-off led by bank shares.\n*****\n> Dow futures shed 66 points, or 0.2%. S&P 500 futures dipped 0.1%, and Nasdaq-100 futures traded flat.\n*****\n> Shares of the SVB Financial tumbled again on Friday, down another 63% after initially plunging on plans to raise more than $2 billion in capital in a bid to offset losses from bond sales.\n*****\n> The move weighed on the financial sector and banking stocks, with the SPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF down more than 2%. Shares of First Republic and Signature Bank were last down about 18% and 12%, respectively.\n*****\n> Wall Street posted a losing session Thursday. A drop in SVB Financial shares spurred a broad financial sector selloff, as investors grew concerned that higher interest rates would result in banks facing losses on loans due to borrower defaults. The selloff pushed the S&P\u2019s financial sector down 4.1% for its worst day since 2020.\n*****\n> On Thursday, the Nasdaq Composite recorded a 2.05% slide, while the S&P 500 posted a 1.85% dip. The Dow lost 543.54 points, or 1.66%, as the 30-stock index closed below its 200-day moving average for the first time since Nov. 9. All three major averages are on pace to finish the week down 3% or more.\n*****\n> Wall Street is bracing for February jobs report, which is slated to be released at 8:30 a.m. ET. Economists polled by Dow Jones expect nonfarm payrolls to rise 225,000 in the month, which would mark a slowdown in growth from January\u2019s unexpectedly large gain of 517,000.\n*****\n> The unemployment rate is expected to remain unchanged from January \u2014 when it hit a low not seen since 1969 \u2014 at 3.4%, according to Dow Jones. Hourly wages are expected to have increased 0.4% from the prior month, gaining 4.8% from 12 months ago, economists estimate.\n*****\n> While having more jobs is considered good for the economy, a better-than-expected report can push stocks lower, according to Brad McMillan, chief investment officer for Commonwealth Financial Network. That\u2019s because more workers can signal more demand, he said, which would indicate higher inflation.\n*****\n> Traders are pricing in a roughly 63% chance of the Federal Reserve raising rates by half of a percentage point at its next policy meeting in about two weeks, according to the CME FedWatch Tool. Investors see Friday\u2019s job report as a key driver in that decision, given the central bank\u2019s continued focus on the strength of the labor market as a justification for rate increases.\n*****\n> \u201cA strong report would be bad news for the Fed, for interest rates, and for markets,\u201d McMillan said.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n# YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/9c3tNfg.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n# TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S S&P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/yjTQnI4.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/WKOpmVO.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#NEXT WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/txxF4eq.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#NEXT WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/dZlNPqB.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#NEXT WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!]()**)\n(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/kVI3rV2.jpg)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/z4TIqyx.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES!]()**)\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/7icyoPG.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/DJIV7Wz.png)**\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/GR8c77b.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/OkEW3Ev.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/NyKBevf.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/LXwVxM5.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/gm6NzIE.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/10/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-premarket-svb-financial-allbirds-docusign-and-more.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n> **SVB Financial** \u2014 Shares of the company known as Silicon Valley Bank extended their big slide, falling more than 40% in early morning trading after the company Thursday announced a plan to raise more than $2 billion in capital to help offset losses on bond sales.

He was going on about how some day all sorts of devices would be connected to the internet - TV's, refrigerator, thermostat, home cameras, etc. And how his niche (ish) language named Java was going to run it all. The keynote speaker's name was Larry Ellison.\n\nI clearly recall a conversation with other attendees where we joked about his \"internet of things\", who would really want everything in their home on the internet?!? We were all professional developers, full of knowledge and experience but lacking in vision. And here I am decades later coding software for IoT devices. \n\nSome people are capable of a long term vision that others can only laugh at, not see.\n\nIs Zuck like Ellison here? Beats me - personally I think the whole metaverse idea, while great in movies like Ready Player One, will actually suck. Maybe it's an enormous black hole absorbing cash. But perhaps it's not.. what do I know, I thought IoT was stupid 20 years ago.",

Ever since, I DCA'd every month, so far 100% into individual stocks, all in US market.

I read a lot of threads here, and recurring wisdom is that beating the market once doesn't mean I will manage to do so every year. Which is why I started thinking about moving some of my assets into ETF's and maybe other more stable instruments so my portfolio is no longer 100% individual stocks.\n\nAnd now here comes the question I would love to get an advice from more experienced investors - what's the best strategy in my position?\n\nA) keep the winners, let them run wild, cut the losses, sell my misses and move those funds into ETF's?\n\nB) vice versa - realize the gains, move them to ETF's, keep dca'ing losses until they go back into green?\n\nC) Just move all of it, winners or losers?\n\nD) Leave all of them alone, and dca into ETF'S from now on instead?\n\nE) None of the above?\n\nAll suggestions would be much appreciated.",

    "title": "Analyzing the Analysts: Using average analyst price target to identify possible buying opportunities amongst the top 100 companies in the S&P",
    "selftext": "Hello everyone,\n\nI'm a lazy investor and don't like to do much due diligence, but I do like to make money. Unfortunately these two things about me are often at odds as I've lost money in the past for not doing my DD. As such, I continue to be lazy but I try and find ways to work around doing due diligence and hopefully finding loop holes.\n\nOne such way that I have been thinking about recently is using analyst ratings, reviews and price targets as a surrogate for due diligence. In essence, I try to just have these analysts do the work for me. An idea I had is that much in the same way that with those who believe in technical analysis hold that everything you need to know about a stock is baked into it's price action, and so when something good happens the stock price goes up and when something bad happens the stock price goes down, thus all you need is to analyze trends in stock price and you'll be analyzing everything about the stock by proxy, I have a thesis (or theory) that perhaps you can do the same or something similar with analyst price targets of companies.\n\nNow I know that anyone who has read this far, already thinks I'm an idiot. Many experienced individual investors probably find market analysts to be stupid and therefor I'm stupid for following their lead, but I would argue to the contrary for a few reasons. As much as I have put in a lot of effort to learn about how the market operates (been investing for the last 6 years, started learning actively about it as much as I could a couple years prior to that), there is still much I don't know as I don't have a finance or economics degree. Moreover, as bad as you may think an analyst is, they are at least competent enough to keep their job as an analyst at the investment firm that allows them to make stock price target selections. Lastly, and most importantly, what I am about to discuss below uses the aggregate of several analyst price targets so I'm not relying on a single analyst but several (probably between 10 and 40 per company). I think if two-dozen analysts are strongly in favor of a company, it is unlikely that my novice investor wisdom would have researched the company and found a flaw that they all missed.\n\nSo what I did yesterday evening was go through the top 100 S&P 500 companies by market cap and find the current average price target for them on Yahoo Finance. I then divided the current stock price (at the close on 7/31) by that price target and expressed it as a percentage to see how far off the company was from the average price target analysts were aiming for. Then I also listed how many total ratings each company had, and how many of them were 'Strong Buys' and 'Buys'.\n\nThis yielded the following table:\n\n|+|A|B|C|D|E|F|G|H|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|1|Company|Current Price|Price Target|Percent to Target|Total Ratings|# Strong Buy Ratings|# Buy Ratings|% of Ratings that were Strong

I wanted to identify companies that had at least 25% of their analyst ratings be 'Strong Buys', to have at least 20 analyst ratings available and for the current stock price to be at 90% or less of the average price target. This lead me to the following 11 companies:\nMicron Technologies (MU), Boston Scientific (BSX), Abbot Laboratories (ABT), Merck Scientific (MRK), Stryker (SYK), The Cigna Group (CI), Broadcom (AVGO), Comcast (CMCSA), Honeywell International (HON), Analogue Devices (ADI), and Intuit Inc. (INTU)\n\nI have about $5,000 I'd like to invest right now and I have half a mind to just put it equally weighted into these 11 companies and just watch it for the next year or two. I'll either do that or put it all in VOO, but I have a feeling that these 11 companies might beat the S&P 500 over the next 24 months.\n\nWhat do you guys think?",

    "selftext": "I've hung onto a sizeable chunk of AAPL for 15 years, snagged back in 2008 at the opportune moment. For all that time, I never felt the urge to venture into other investments until the recent buzz surrounding AI. Like everyone else, I was wowed by NVDA's stellar performance, just as AAPL seemed to hit a plateau and face some challenges.  \nAs a result, I offloaded half of my AAPL in November for NVDA. Come January, I found myself questioning why I hadn't just sold the whole lot, especially considering that one's growth trajectory was bound to outshine the other in the same timeframe. However, by then, NVDA had already nearly doubled. This prompted me to scrutinize the market more closely, leading to selling off the remaining half of my AAPL and diversifying my portfolio.  \nToday, here's where I stand:  \n\\- 61% NVDA  \n\\- 11% SMTC  \n\\- 9% MSFT  \n\\- 6% ORCL  \n\\- 6% MU  \n\\- 3% MRVL  \n\\- 2.5% AMD  \n\\- 2.5% PLTR  \nFirst off, I'm keen to hear your take on this mix of investments. Secondly, I'm pondering why I opted for seven different stocks instead of going all-in on NVDA, much like I did with AAPL in 2008. Let's be clear: I chose these stocks because I believe they offer reasonable profit prospects over a 3 to 5-year window for the entire portfolio. However, I'm still convinced that within a one-year timeframe, NVDA is likely to outperform the rest.  \nBottom line: Did I make the sensible move by diversifying across different stocks, or does my gut feeling that I should focus on the big player hold merit?",
