Once school ended in June and I had free time, so I sold the leaps, and this is where the real gambling journey began.\n\n\n\nMy first trades were just random weeklies, for example on the first Monday of July I bought TSLA puts when the line went up and calls when the line went down like a monkey. Believe it or not this was only the beginning of the retardedness.\n\n\n\nI read about Donald Jr.\u2019s new SPAC in the daily thread so I decided to invest into CLBR / PEW calls, and was up bigly going into the merger. Then, when the merger actually happened and I got absolutely demolished. This Donald guy had successfully grifted me.\n\n\n\nI got mad at the market so I full ported into OPEN since y\u2019all seemed to believe in it, however this time I actually made money. I\u2019m not sure what the fuck I was doing but I bought both calls and puts, sold the calls at the top and then sold the puts after it got rugged in the middle of the day and made back the money I lost.\u00a0\n\n\n\nThe week after that I was feeling lucky I guess and went back to buying random shit (technically I never stopped doing it, there are like 200 other trades that I didn't bother mentioning, but this time specifically was just extra retarded). I don\u2019t even remember why I got 10k worth of AMD calls but apparently I did, and there\u2019s this one day where I was using half my port on SPY 0DTEs for some reason.  \n\n\n\nAt this point near the end of July I realized that I was being little bit too autistic, so in order to try to be slightly less autistic I went over to check out the value investing sub to and holy shit they\u2019re even more autistic so I gave up and came back to wsb immediately. Saw some guy say that the Google antitrust remedies were coming out soon so I proceeded to full port GOOG calls a few times which yielded the biggest juiciest gains yet and boom now I\u2019m somehow at 50k.\n\n\n\nI just started university this year and nearly had to bag fries every summer to pay my tuition due to the fact that I am poor af, but this gain covers my entire degree, so I am genuinely thankful to this community, because without you guys I would not have found out about options.

The answer is always options. /yes, this is a joke  \n\n\n(my last post got removed, ig for not being enough of a meme? or maybe my options joke? well, now it's full effort time, with emoji reactions and making sure I fully identify jokes... hey, I'll even throw in educational backstory)\n\neducational backstory: year to date losses were from call options in $SOFI. Those would have fully recovered, if you take a look at YTD performance. I'd been doing quite well with $SOFI in my 401(k), but of course, the moment I liquidated my ever-rolling $SOFI calls in Robinhood (to evaluate my next move), that's when $SOFI mooned, and I figured it was a dead cat bounce, so I missed out. So I've since returned to an old favorite, which is what is driving the portfolio value difference between each screenshot taken within minutes of each other\u2013lots of $VFC call options that have been on a tear lately (I'm sorry\u2013I like en dashes, I'm not AI).\n\nNow for that All-Time loss story. A bit of that was from learning options, but most of those losses, iirc, were from early stage healthcare stocks, a movie ticket service, and a major, now infamous, Indian streaming company that had some loyal followers on forums. I abandoned my $TSLA call options just before it went onto massive gains years ago, and went all in on the streamer.  Actually did seem legit from my DD, because they were merging with a notable American studio that had produced some solid blockbusters. But hey, guess what? Months after that merger went through, the American studio, iirc, sued the streaming platform and they separated. The rest is history. Also tried out a healthcare company with a solid product portfolio and management that had good results on previous ventures. Like a lot of early medical companies seem to though, they used the stock like a piggybank and kept issuing more and more shares. It didn't matter how well trials were doing or what cleared the FDA, because any gain would be suppressed by another issuance and a fair bit of M&A and management bonuses that were funded by shares.\n\nI don't know what it is though. When I'm self-managing my 401(k), I'm very responsible and have solid, market-beating gains. When I open up Robinhood, it's like I need to rep my WSB cred and yolo on some hair-brained idea.\n\nSo now I'm on my redemption arc of trying to treat my Robinhood account a bit more like my 401(k).",

    "title": "$PTLO come for the earnings, stay for the value",
    "selftext": "**TLDR: $PTLO earnings Tuesday Aug 5th AM. $PTLO go up. Buy, make money.**\n\n**My positions:**\n\n***Shares a lot***\n\n***options a little: Jan 2026 $15, Jan 2027 $12, August 15th $10s. Also sold some $10 CSPs in August, but that's probably a little advanced for this class***\n\n$PTLO earnings releases on Tuesday, and I think it is set up to take off.  Ever been like *\"Damn if only I bought $wing, $cava, $cmg early\".* Well guess what, HERE YOU GO.\n\nWhat is Portillos? Chicagoland fast casual that serves, burgers, Chicago style hot dogs, polish sausage, italian beefs, chocolate cake shake, etc. IPO'd late 2021 and bagged a bunch of people (like literally every IPO of the time). Since IPO has been focusing on expansion outside of Chicagoland\n\n# Bull Notes (in no particular order)\n\n* Activist investor group Engaged Capital took \\~10% position late last year and been working with $PTLO to quality candidates to the board and optimize expansion and restaurants. There most relevant and impressive work is with Shake Shack\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/835ezbs5hzgf1.png?width=1439&format=png&auto=webp&s=41af3ea19c6cf6149e7879581a480b93974f31cd\n\n* Jack Hartung was added to the board this year. He was CFO of Chipotle for 22 years and is current president. Has Chipotle fallen off in recent years, yes. But what we care about is he was apart of the EXPLOSIVE GROWTH of Chipotle since pre 2006 IPO. He is also on the board of $TSLA, which is cool, i guess (Portillo's Tesla diner anyone?) Pre chipotle he did 18 years for Mcdonalds Corp. Guy is solid\n* Most recently, Eugene Lee was added to the board in June. CEO of Darden Restaurants from 2015-2022. Darden has some big name restaurants in their portfolio, so another star player to the leadership team that can guide Portillo's along the growth journey\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yblypmfchzgf1.png?width=1240&format=png&auto=webp&s=fd5f4aece1ba9ec6ffcbfbaddc5f9ecb4e4eedaf\n\n* AUV (monies per restaurant) for Portillo's is crazy high $8.7 million per restaurant in 2025 (dragged down a bit by newer operations that aren't up to snuff yet). A chipotle does like 3 million, a texas road house does like 7 million. The only comparable I can find is Chik-fil-le which restaurants can do over $9 million. You should go buy there stock, o wait you cant.\n* Total restaurants 94 at end off Q1. Restaurants were going loaded on the back half of the year. 1 Q2, 5-6 Q3, and 5-6 Q4. It'll be good to hear how that's progressing. My guess would be like 3-4ish by the time of the call. There goal is to get scale up to 12-15% per year and almost 10x restaurants to over 900 locations\n* Breakfast. Experimenting with it, Already expanded locations from the initial 5 so thats promising. I've tried it, its delicious. Hope to hear some numbers. Mega bull example is McDonald's whose revenue from breakfast is like 25%. Maybe we could hope for a +10% revenue to start at full roll out (if its determined to make permanent and would likely only be chicagoland to start).  Would like to hear some numbers on the call\n* PE current low 20s trading like its not a growth stock.\n\n# Bear Notes\n\n* Big sell off -10%  day, recently. Chipotle earnings caused a massive selloff in all restaurant stocks due to bad same store sales. I think its bullshit. Proof go look at $cake and $wing earnings last week. Turns its a chipotle problem not an industry problem. I guess sales go down when you charge more, give out less food, and treat customers like shit. This followed by general market tanking last week. This all to say its not PTLOs fault, its the market that's wrong!\n* Daddy Powell cucking trump and won't cut rates. Yes generally small caps benefit from lower rates. They'd help PTLO thrive, but are not needed to survive and continue growing at a steady pace. Since jobs data got \"fixed\", maybe that changes sooner than later\n* New restaurants performance. Growing pains IMO. Likely takes 1-2 years to reach maturity\n* Poor stock performance. I call it opportunity.\n* Cattle futures are to the moon. Think they've done pretty good keeping price up to offsets costs. Can they keep doing it?\n\nHere's a monthly chart\n\n[O WOWOWO](https://preview.redd.it/0u7765ml4igf1.png?width=1439&format=png&auto=webp&s=f8286496937f277cada24542f6216bdcef864985)\n\nDoesn't this chart look like shit? To the habitual top blaster sure. My personal strategy involves buying low and selling higher than that (not for everyone I know). Also a guy a X posted about this Wackoff guy and 2025 sure looks like Jackoffs CuMulation. If u google institutional ownership it is a whopping 97%. Smart money been stock piling to sell later to u chasers. Front run it for once in your life. Big SEXY volume rising into earnings. You know what moves tickers VOLUME.\n\nYou know how I know this shit can go? Cuz I already round tripped some shares this year. Lows under $8 to just under $16 and back where we are today. It was lonely at the top. I want to bring friends with me this time.\n\n[Daily Chart](https://preview.redd.it/zggfe8xg7igf1.png?width=1439&format=png&auto=webp&s=edcb2b566c4e15fd928de3e107f408458dfa8590)\n\nI regret nothing. I'm holding shares long enough to be marked long and pay as little taxes as possible like a true patriot. Besides just cuz I round tripped it doesn't mean I didn't pick up any souvenirs.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/36ully3khzgf1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=619113463917a12068d5ac93c5b905356c3b4e3c\n\n# Bonus Hourly Chart\n\n[Bottom?](https://preview.redd.it/ek741fue6igf1.png?width=1439&format=png&auto=webp&s=01a59db67129f28b6a77445b5cef57119b727395)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u2azuvlj6igf1.png?width=680&format=png&auto=webp&s=a8da68ad143a18e2ac30342fd7afae885185b2ae\n\nThank you for your attention to this matter!",

    "selftext": "When I last posted the day before the Robotaxi \u201claunch\u201d that featured only 10-20 vehicles, supervised drivers in the passenger seat and teleoperators on standby, I listed a bunch of reasons why I felt TSLA would drop in the \u201cnext few weeks\u201d:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/s/qtmovulCSg\n\nAlthough I didn\u2019t foresee the absolutely regarded retail pump the day after the launch, I did what anyone with balls should do:\n\nI increased my position even more.  My $60K put position is now a nearly $72K put position.  I cashed out of my July puts and loaded up on August puts.\n\nWhy did I do this?  One of my catalysts was that Elon would antagonize TACO again.  This has played out exactly as I expected and then some.  An \u201cAmerica Party\u201d now means Elon is TACO\u2019s enemy.  This is insanely bad for all of Elon\u2019s companies, from TSLA to SpaceX to X.ai and everything else.\n\nNow that Elon has gone nuclear, not only will equity values of all his companies plummet, but Elon will likely have to sell more TSLA shares to fund his new political party.\n\nI expect a big payoff for my August puts now that TSLA is without any meaningful positive catalysts until after earnings on July 23 (at least).\n\nBetween now and then, more and more people will realize:\n\n1.  How devastating the Big Beautiful Bill will be to TSLA\u2019s 2026 cashflows with the $7,500 EV tax credit expiring and the seemingly instant death of regulatory credit sales.  TSLA may lose money on a FCF basis as early as next quarter but almost certainly in 2026.\n\n2.  Elon and TACO are both loose cannons and can pop off at the mouth over a hurt ego at any moment.  Tweets trigger the algos.  THIS WILL BE A CONSTANT OVERHANG FOR TSLA GOING FORWARD.  Momentum will be very difficult to ignite now that Elon has pissed off most of America.\n\n3.  The true launch of Robotaxi with no teleoperators/supervised drivers will take MUCH longer than most of the Cult followers think.  Each state (including TX) will have different bars for TSLA to clear in order to operate at scale.  Those bars just got higher with Elon starting The America Party.  Given that TSLA is only a Level 2 ADAS technology, there\u2019s a lot of trial and error before they can operate at scale.  One accident and ensuing bad PR, will send the stock plummeting.\n\n4.  Optimus won\u2019t be a popular product (if ever) until TSLA can have the robots operating at much more human levels (movement, comprehension, performative actions, etc.).  The Asians are way ahead on robot technology, the same way they are now way ahead on EV manufacturing/quality.\n\nFor all those that say \u201cbelieve it or not, just buy calls\u201d, TSLA is now down ~17% YTD.  The S&P 500 is up 7% and even the pathetic Russell 2000 is up ~1% YTD.\n\nSo please, by all means, keep telling me I\u2019m stupid and that I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing.   Keep buying your calls even though deep down you know you are just burning your money due to the fact you are in a CULT.\n\nI\u2019ll keep shorting every nonsensical rally that you regards trigger as TSLA continues its overall downward trend back towards 150-200.\n\n\n",

TSLA highly correlated to fake internet money.\n\n- TX senate vote and signature of Governor requiring all autonomous vehicles to get to Level autonomy in order to operate starting in September.  This is a huge precedent which now means TSLA robotaxis will take much longer to scale because each State will have its own autonomous driving thresholds and review periods.  Waymo will continue to expand faster than TSLA.\n\n- Attention now shifts to July 22 earnings.  Sales are pretty much down YoY throughout most of the entire world.  Analyst downgrades are coming.  TSLA will likely lower full year guidance.\n\n- I expect a class action lawsuit from disgruntled HW3 owners soon because they are all realizing Elon lied about HW3 getting a free upgrade to HW4 and beyond.  It is clear now that HW3 vehicles wont ever have true FSD and the legal liability will be in the tens of billions of dollars.\n\n- Elon is still popping off about one of Mango\u2019s closest White House aides.  The probability of Elon pissing off Mango again is not insignificant.\n\n- $7,500 EV Tax Credit likely expires at the end of this year.\n\n- Oil spike likely means Fed delays rate cuts further.  High P/E stocks like TSLA generally suffer more in higher rate environments especially if economic growth is also slowing.\n\n",

    "selftext": "Nvidia ([NVDA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NVDA)) has outperformed every stock in the S&P 500 ([\\^GSPC](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5EGSPC)) since\u00a0[the launch of ChatGPT\u00a0](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/how-chatgpt-changed-the-world-of-tech-in-just-one-year-180957543.html)in late November 2022 Shares in the chipmaker have risen nearly 700% since ChatGPT brought the power of artificial intelligence to the masses, far outpacing the S&P 500's roughly 45% over the same time period. The next closest gain for an S&P 500 company in that time period is a 540% pop for Vistra Corp ([VST](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/VST)).Nvidia has established itself as the key provider of chips needed to operate AI systems. Now at the epicenter of an AI arms race, Nvidia has established itself as[\u00a0a cornerstone of the recent bull market](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/live/stock-market-today-tech-leads-stocks-higher-as-nvidia-surges-to-record-high-175727614.html)\u00a0in stocks as the company's sales and profits have skyrocketed over the past several years.\n\nAhead of the\u00a0[company's next quarterly earnings release on May 28](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-to-report-q1-earnings-as-middle-east-deals-export-control-reprieve-boost-stock-122728218.html), we broke down some of the most eye-popping charts that show how Nvidia became one of the most-followed stocks in the market.There's perhaps no clearer way to see how Nvidia ran away from the competition in the AI boom than looking at the company's market capitalization against its peers. Back when ChatGPT launched, Nvidia had a market cap of just over $400 billion. It's now over $3.3 trillion. Over that same time period, chip competitor Intel's ([INTC](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/INTC)) market cap has actually decreased, while Advanced Micro Devices' ([AMD](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMD)) market cap has increased incrementally from $125 billion to $177 billion.Nvidia's rise proved to be at the center of a new technological boom. Combined with Nvidia, the rise in dominance of six other companies \u2014 Apple ([AAPL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL)), Alphabet ([GOOGL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOGL),\u00a0[GOOG](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOG)), Microsoft ([MSFT](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MSFT)), Amazon ([AMZN](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMZN)), Meta ([META](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/META)), and Tesla ([TSLA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA)) \u2014 formed what would come to be known as the\u00a0[\"Magnificent Seven.\"](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/one-chart-shows-how-the-magnificent-7-have-dominated-the-stock-market-in-2023-203250125.html)\n\nThe group began the AI boom with a combined market cap just shy of $7 billion. Now, two and a half years later, the Big Tech group's market cap is worth over $16.8 trillion. The seven companies have grown from about 22% of the S&P 500's market cap in November 2022 to 32% of the index's market cap today.Given the outsized weighting in the S&P 500, large swings in shares of Nvidia have become a feature of how even broad market investors are thinking about the direction of stocks. In June 2024,[\u00a0three Wall Street strategists boosted their year-end S&P 500 targets](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ai-enthusiasm-prompts-3-wall-street-banks-to-raise-stock-market-forecasts-100027154.html), citing better-than-expected consistent performance among key AI players.\n\nAs of May 19, the Magnificent Seven have accounted for about 52% of the S&P 500's gain since Nov. 30, 2022. Nvidia alone has contributed 17.21%, by far the most among the group, with the next closest stock, Microsoft, which has added about 8.8%.Nvidia's stock hasn't been rising from just hype. The company's quarterly financial metrics have soared. In the quarter ChatGPT launched, Nvidia posted revenue of $6.3 billion. Two years later, it would post revenue of $35.3 billion. That's a 460% increase in sales in two years. As seen in the chart below, the main source of growth for Nvidia has been its data center revenue segment, which includes the sales of its AI chips.\n\nFrom the company's fourth quarter of 2023 to its final quarter of its 2025 reporting period, data center revenue grew almost 900%.\n\nNvidia's data center revenue particularly stands out when considering its rise against peers in the industry. In the final quarter of 2024, Nvidia notched a record $35.58 billion in just data center revenue, up from $3.62 billion in the final quarter of 2022.\n\nIn comparison, Alphabet's data center revenue increased to $11.96 billion, ending 2024 up from $7.32 billion in the final quarter of 2022.\n\n\n\n",

Otherthan bulls and bears yelling on each other and random meme shit. \nLet\u2019s collect all the facts and try to find what\u2019s gonna happen in few weeks. \n\nHere are some facts we know so far and i will try to be impartial as i can be and just state facts and not my opinion. \n- Elon announced robotaxi planned launch in Austin in June. \n- TSLA stock has rallied 40+ % since the announcement. \n- TSLA sales are being disastrous worldwide and on going sales news are negative. Hence making the stock rally purely based on hopium on robotaxi launch. \n- TSLA FSD is currently at level-2 autonomy. \n- Full autonomy with driver less operation is level-5. \n- Tsla uses a complete vision based system. vs competitors multiple sensors including LIDAR and Radars. \n- We haven\u2019t seen any test vehicles or any tests happening around robotaxi despite launch date being just few weeks away. (Waymo did years of testing before making their service publicly available)\n- On the otherside, tsla fans seems to be seeing all the current fsd being driven by consumers are actual test and that is good enough for fsd launch. \n\nThat\u2019s all for now. Let\u2019s discuss and as we go we can add more points and if possible we can keep this as a long thread to keep track the planned event. \n",

Several noteworthy tech, travel, and medical companies are also on this week\u2019s calendar.\n\nHome Depot\u2019s scheduled report for Tuesday comes after the hardware retailer's\u00a0weaker-than-expected outlook\u00a0in the previous quarter, even as its quarterly results topped analyst estimates. The home improvement giant said it expected to grow sales by 2.8% in 2025, lower than the 3.27% expected from analysts tracking the company, who are surveyed by Visible Alpha, while its expected\u00a0comparable store sales\u00a0growth below 1% also undershot estimates.\n\nRival hardware seller Lowe\u2019s expected report the following day comes after it too delivered better-than-expected quarterly sales, but its\u00a0guidance for 2025\u00a0came in under Visible Alpha estimates.\n\nThe expected report from Target on Wednesday comes after it warned in early March that uncertainty around tariffs could\u00a0weigh on its current-quarter earnings, even as the retailer posted comparable store sales results above projections at 1.5% in the most recent quarter. Discount retailer TJX's scheduled Wednesday report comes as the TJ Maxx parent also\u00a0delivered a disappointing outlook\u00a0for the quarter just ended, while rival discount chain Ross Stores is on Thursday\u2019s calendar along with fashion brand Ralph Lauren.\n\nCybersecurity provider Palo Alto Networks is expected to report on Tuesday after its last\u00a0quarterly results were boosted by AI adoption, including cloud investment and infrastructure modernization.

Other noteworthy reports this week include homebuilder Toll Brothers on Tuesday, medical device maker Medtronic on Wednesday, and tax software provider Intuit on Thursday.\n\n**Fed Speakers Scheduled as Central Bank Faces Pressure on Rates**\n\nSeveral Federal Reserve officials will speak this week, shortly after President Trump criticized the central bank\u2019s decisions to\u00a0keep interest rates unchanged. The Fed has said it is monitoring the economic impact of tariffs as it reviews\u00a0incoming data on inflation\u00a0and the labor market.\n\nAn Atlanta Federal Reserve event on Monday and Tuesday will feature Fed Vice Chair Jefferson, Atlanta Fed President Bostic, Dallas Fed President Logan, San Francisco Fed President Daly, and Cleveland Fed President Hammack. Federal Reserve Gov. Bowman and New York Fed President Williams are among other Fed representatives expected to appear this week.\n\nMarket watchers will be tuned in to home-seller data this week, as reports for existing and new home sales are expected. The data comes as\u00a0home sales have been sluggish\u00a0amid\u00a0high interest rates and challenging inventory.\n\nInvestors are also expected to focus on jobless-claim numbers on Thursday, while the S&P Global flash\u00a0Purchasing Managers Index (PMI)\u00a0will provide an early look at how the manufacturing and services sectors are faring so far in May.\u00a0",

    "title": "TSLA keeps trading like a leveraged S&P 500 ETF",
    "selftext": "Since TSLA's disastrous earnings last week, a lot of people have asked how the stock manages to be up in spite of it all. And *part* of the reason is probably that Musk managed to get away with promising to cut his involvement with DOGE back to 1-2 days per week and have this reported as \"Musk stepping back from DOGE\", as if the effects of taking a chainsaw to your own brand were linear with number of hours per week spent doing it.\n\nBut I think a lot of the reason TSLA managed to have a run of good trading days in spite of terrible earnings is that on those days, the S&P 500 was up, and TSLA seems to spend a lot of time trading like a leveraged S&P 500 ETF.\n\nI had a vague, intuitive sense of this, but I wanted to put some numbers on it. There've been 68 trading day's since Trump's inauguration (not counting the currently ongoing trading day). On 26 of those days, TSLA and the S&P 500 were both down. On 22 of those days, TSLA and the S&P 500 were both up. And there were 14 days where the S&P 500 was up while TSLA was down, but only 6 days where TSLA was up while the S&P 500 was down.\n\nSo the first thing to notice here is there's a bit of an asymmetry\u2014on days when the S&P 500 was up, TSLA was up a little more than 60% of the time, whereas on days when the S&P 500 was down, TSLA was down more than 80% of the time.\n\nThe other thing is the magnitude of the swings. On days both TSLA and the S&P 500 were up, TSLA was up more in all but two cases. But on days when TSLA and the S&P 500 were both down, TSLA was down more in *every single case.* A linear regression of TSLA's price movements and the S&P 500's gives you a slope of about 2.14, meaning that on average (and I must emphasize this is an average), if the S&P moves by 1%, TSLA can be expected to move by more than 2%.\n\nWhat's going on here? Well, first of all, TSLA should have very little ability to push around the S&P 500 by itself. It may be a \"megacap\" fund, but its weight in the S&P 500 is less than 2%, and even AAPL is less than 7%. On the other hand, S&P 500 index funds probably push around TSLA a lot\u2014inflows and outflows into index funds, whether traditional mutual funds or ETFs, result in buying and selling of the components, affecting their price. That's how index funds are *supposed* to work.\n\nThe real question is why the changes are consistently amplified. Part of the story is probably that TSLA has a high P/E ratio, and companies with high P/E ratios are just in general more sensitive to market trends (something you can see if you compare the implied volatility on growth ETFs to the implied volatility on value ETFs). I do wonder if there's an additional factor, that TSLA has been in the news a lot, contributing to its volatility, which then becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy because volatility attracts gamblers and because quants build the observed volatility into their models.\n\nAn important upshot of this: even though I am not kidding when I say I [expect SPY to go to 420](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ji8bie/spy_to_420/), I've never bought SPY puts, because I expect that *real* pain from the China tariffs hits in a few weeks, TSLA will crash even harder than the broad market. There are probably other stocks you could make this play with, though I don't have a specific one I really like. (Notably, I recently opened a short position on PLTR, then thought better of it and closed the position at a small loss after deciding their bull case was significantly less implausible than TSLA's.)\n\nEDIT: I'm a dumbass. TSLA is a high-beta stock. I've known about CAPM for years but always hear about it in the context of people wanting *low*\\-beta investments, which is probably why I blanked on applying it to TSLA.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/93e1kefdmzxe1.png?width=2156&format=png&auto=webp&s=5b2f8657743b728b226f0936f83fb6fa1f63b1ab",

    "title": "$META Earnings already priced in \u2014 be careful on Calls",
    "selftext": "I\u2019ve noticed that when people expect something to happen in the market, they often price in the movement before it happens. It\u2019s harder to make money off of that initial move, but it\u2019s easier to gamble on them being wrong\u2026or less right. \n\nEspecially around earnings time, as we all saw with TSLA, everyone knew their earning would be shit. So the stock moved like shit. Then the earnings were horrendous. And we pumped??? I\u2019m well aware that TSLA is a meme stock and makes 0 sense, but I also believe that there is a lesson in that movement. \n\nI think there is a possibility of the flip side for META. Everyone thinks they\u2019re going to have good earnings. The forecasts are high and the stock is up (with the rest of the market) in the last few days. \n\nFurthermore, in the past 10 *straight* quarters META has outperformed earnings estimates. Yet, they do not rise on earnings every time. Additionally, the news of AI advances and AD revenue has already been priced in, in my opinion, so I am doubting that this will affect META movement post earnings.\n\nSo, if everyone is *right* and META outperforms? I think we have an after hours pump followed by a market open selloff, from the pump, back to a modest gain. \n\nIf META underperforms? Blood. Many are  expecting META to meet or beat expectations, as it\u2019s done for the past 10 quarters. \n\nIf META meets forecasts? I think there\u2019s a decent chance we see red movement due to a pre-pricing of good earnings. \n\nTo back up this silly little thesis I have a table of META\u2019s earnings reports along side the stock\u2019s movement the week before, movements in after-hours, the following day, and week. \n\nFirst thing you\u2019ll notice in this chart is that last quarter the data shows me to be wrong. To my knowledge the news of new ad strategies and AI advancements dropped then which contributed to the gain. The quarter before that however, the data shows me being correct. I also think that the high volatility of this market could heavily contribute to a drop on positive earnings. Look at $SNAP. \n\nLast thing I\u2019ll add is earnings are always extremely unpredictable like everyone knows. I\u2019m a regard who is trying to recognize a pattern where there may not be one, but god damn it I\u2019ll lose money trying to find one! \n\nTL;DR \nI believe the market already priced in a positive earnings for META. Looking at past data, it\u2019s possible that even if META exceeds estimates, the stock will drop. And if earnings meet or are below expectations META should be strongly red. I\u2019m not buying calls and would recommend being cautious. Puts could be the move but everything is a lotto around earnings. ",

    "selftext": "I posted a bit ago about my UNH short that worked out very well, and I've been reluctant to post things that aren't either closed or essentially already played out.  But I figure this one is the last truly spicy one left in my portfolio at the moment and I figured I would share it as well.  As a caveat, this is not investment advice.  My overall portfolio is extremely conservative, so I can take some (fairly crazy) flyers here and there to get a bit of alpha.  \n\n\nI've been (very happily) shorting TSLA in the medium-term.  I can get into the full thesis later if anyone cares (it's not different than a majority of other bear cases on TSLA)  but I started taking positions as soon as Elmo decided giving a Nazi salute was a cool idea.  I like to enter positions with options strategies that are medium to long term (1 month or longer to expiry, a lot of LEAPS usually).  I tend to have a mix of spreads and naked positions.  \n\n\nWith TSLA  I have three positions outstanding.\n\n\n\n(1) April 25 2025 200/230 Bear Put Vertical - paid about 69k several months ago.  My original thinking back when I bought it was to close it before the earning tonights.  Thinking about rolling it outwards at least a week, though it's pretty expensive.  If not, I'm also considerng roughly halving it before market close so that I've got my basis back and I'm just playing with house money on tonight's earnings print.\n\n\n\n(2) May 16 2025 235/250  Bear Put Vertical - paid about 15k the day after Trump cancelled the tariffs, figuring that the bounce upwards was really overpriced. This is another one I may cut in half.\n\n\n\n(3) June 2025 Bear Put Vertical - paid about 200/240 - paid relatively the most for this (40k) last week.  It has a fair bit of time to expiry, so despite the bad pricing, I'm going to let this one ride a bit longer before re-evaluating a trim or closure of the position.  \n\n\n\nAll together, these open positions are about 125k in cost basis, sitting at around 100k in paper profits.  It's bit more risk than I like given the bizarre price action that TSLA exhibits, even when it missed and even when it gives bad but blurry near team guidance.  On the flip side, I think the fundamental story here is really really bleak.  Elon has to successfully sell investors on some new radical fantasyland project to avoid a bad day tomorrow.  I don't think simply saying \"I'm out of politics and focused on my companies\" is going to cut it.",

    "selftext": "Not interestd in long-term debates about viability but, short-term, this has got to be peak uncertainty about the company's future. Q2 delivery consensus has come down a bit but estimates north of 350k still scream 'general TSLA challenges' not refelcting a scenario where Q2 winds up being a complete crisis quarter.\n\n  \nWhy couldn't Q2 deliveries potentially seize up and wind up coming in < 200k if only for one quarter? \n\nQ1 typically being weak, seasonality and other historical factors are of little value at this point in time as it seems like there has been a structural shift in the perception of TSLA that isn't going back anytime soon. In fact, so much has happened in such a short period of time that any projections based on YoY trends or growth rates seem antiquated to me. Looking Q1 25 as a baseline - Q2 2025 estimates that reflect an expectation of QoQ growth in units delivered seem aggressive to say the least when broken down regionally:\n\n2025 Q1 Deliveries: 337k:\n\nUS 128k\n\nChina 79k\n\nEU 63k\n\nRoW approx. 67k with biggest shares from:\n\nCanada 8k\n\nSK/JPN 9k\n\nAU/NZ 6k\n\nMid East/LATAM combine for 21k\n\nThe current 367k Q2 consensus reflects 17% expected YoY decline in deliveries and, holding regional sales mix constant from Q1, implies Q2 expected deliveries:\n\nUS 140k\n\nChina 86k\n\nEU 69k\n\nRoW 73k\n\nQ1 deliveries were announced Apr 2, the morning of the 'recprocal' rate announcements. The quarter has just begun and the escalations in uncertainty that have taken place only very recently will impact TSLA for all of Q2 most likely. \n\nI'm having a tought time seeing US deliveries growing by 12k in Q2 vs the first three months of this year considering how quickly the brand has deteriorated...\n\nAbove all however, I see the biggest shock risk in the EU and China for Q2 deliveries. \n\nOn Friday we saw TSLA announce a pause on taking orders on certain models in China. That can obviously be rescinded on a whim but, at the same time, can be expanded just as easily too. I think the tit-for-tat risk with China and US tariff escalation may have peaked but headline risk is still high on a day-to-day basis and, given TSLA's proximity to the administration, any new flare ups are likely to hurt TSLA directly. In fact, I would go as far to say China might be inclined to take actions specifically targetting TSLA and Musk if for no other reason than the perceived rift it could cause between Trump and Musk. For China in Q2, can we really say there isn't at least an elevated chance that all new orders and deliveries could be paused at least temporarily? \n\nAt the same time, I cannot fathom how EU Q2 deliveries could show an increase of 6k vs. Q1. I think very soon (gut sense says this month) we will see the EU and China announce a deal on EVs opening up the Euro Zone market for BYD and others.. EU EV market share is already falling off of a cliff with sentiment towards the US and Musk in particular continuing to decline further. I really think a comprehensive EV deal between China and the EU could mark the start of the end of TSLA in Europe. \n\nCanada might be relatively small overall but Q1 Canadian deliveries were 8.6k - my understanding is a significant majority of those were sold during a particular weekend in January to take advantage of a government EV credit that has since expired. A lot has changed even since January as far as US/Canada relations - does anyone really expect any TSLAs to be delivered in Canada this quarter? \n\nI could see this being the kitchen sink quarter that gives Musk the cover to step away from DOGE as he's needed back at TSLA FT to oversee the 'robot transition'. Afterall, it's been about a year since he told everyone robo taxis were only a year or so away so it's time to come back and pump everyone up with more fantastical promised. I am bearish on TSLA fundamentals and think event contracts on Q2 deliveries might even be a decent way to hedge shenanigan risk on a stock short.  \n\n \n\n",

    "selftext": "Like every self-respecting Value investor, I've been looking for opportunities to divest from my tech-heavy portfolio. AI Stocks like NVDA, PLTR, MSFT, AMZN, TSLA have done great, but some of these valuations just don't make sense and I don't think now is a good time to buy into them anymore.\n\nThat brings me to look for other opportunities. I don't think there's a better opportunity right now than the Healthcare sector.\n\nHistorically, Healthcare has outperformed the S&P, thanks to relatively stable stocks like CNC.\n\nLet's take a step back. What the f\\*%# happened to this stock in the past 2 months ?\n\nThey came out and :\n\n1. Said that their Medical Loss Ratio(MLR) will be much higher because claims are getting expensive\n2. Pulled guidance for 2025\n\nSince then, they've had their Q2 Earnings call. They've revised guidance to a EPS of 1.75 for 2025 (from 7.5 previously, ouch). Given that their Q1 2025 EPS was 2.9, and their Q2 EPS was -0.16, this is pricing in a combined -1$ EPS for Q3 and Q4.\n\nThe bar is very low. Even a small sign of life from the CEO, could send this stock easily back to the 40 - 50 range, as a path to profitability is starting to be priced into the stock.\n\nThe recent headwind, albeit very impactful in the short to medium-term, is temporary. the CEO has said that they have already completed rate re-filings in the 29 states by now, and that the rate decision for each states will be expected in September. The new rates that determine the amount of premiums received, will take into account the high cost for behavioral health(therapists, psychiatric meds etc...),  home health services, and expensive drugs (Wegovy, Ozempic...) .\n\nCompared to the giant UNH, CNC has a much better reputation, isn't under DOJ Investigation, and Ambetter, their Health Insurance Marketplace, has a claims denial rate of 14%, more than half that of UNH.\n\n# Path back to profitability :\n\nCEO and the team are now laser focused on restoring profitability by pulling the necessary levers :\n\n\\- identifying and reducing areas where claims have been too \"costly\"\n\n\\- increasing premium rates, to account for the challenging environment, and with a worst case scenario in mind (continued high morbidity and utilization rate)\n\n\\- hinting at a stock buyback in the Earnings call\n\n\\- Immune from tariff BS and TACO\n\n# Possible risks\n\n\\- The trend of high morbidity and drug use continues to escalate, leading to more people needing expensive surgeries and drugs ==> unlikely, as people who fear that their benefits are being taken away with OBBBA, have already stocked up on drugs/done surgeries\n\n\\- continued political pressure on healthcare costs with bills like the OBBBA ==> unlikely, as this bill seems to be a one-and-done on healthcare, and now the Administration will focus on other more pressing matters (Russia - Ukraine conflict, Inflation, crypto, tax bills for the rich etc ...).\n\nAlso, this is speculation, but I think the full impact of the OBBBA are wayyy overstated. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that by 2034, 16 million people will lose coverage, but that's a decade away. This will be accounted for in the rate re-pricing.\n\n\\- Risks of people changing Insurers because of higher rates ==> given that every Health insurer will be increasing rates, among them: Elevance, UNH, Molina, Blue Cross Blue Shield, CNC will be no exception. People won't switch because none of the other options are better. Centene's health plan is pretty competitive, and compared to Molina health who's the most affordable, Centene's has much better coverage(available across 29 states vs 8 for Molina)\n\nOverall, I think this is a compelling buy, not just for CNC, but for the Health care sector overall, as the benefits greatly outweigh the risk at this point. Historically, the Healthcare Sector has outperformed the S&P, and this is the perfect time to buy in.",

I am targeting potentially good candidates for short-term trading; I have no opinion on them as investments.

The probe centers on allegations that the company inflated patient diagnoses to secure higher federal payments. Stock sold off 5% yesterday, then sold off even more this morning but recovered. I'm mainly interested in the short side on this and not interested in the long unless we do something crazy like go back down to $250.\n\n[**SRPT (Sarepta)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SRPT&p=d)\\- Safety officials indicated that SRPT could modify dosing or manufacturing processes and conduct additional tests to address liver-related issues associated with its gene therapy, Elevidys. This follows reports of serious liver injuries, including fatalities, linked to the treatment and potentially turning it into a black box treatment. This has been run down from 30 -> 10.50 in the past few days and touched 10.50 again premarket.

In\u00a0early July, Tesla reported a 14% year-over-year slide in vehicle deliveries to 384,000 for the second quarter.\u00a0\n\nAnd in\u00a0Europe, Tesla\u2019s new car registrations declined last month, according to data released Thursday from the European Automobile Manufacturers Association.\n\nTesla shares have been hammered this year, with the stock down 25% in 2025, by far the worst performer among tech\u2019s megacaps.\n\nOn Wednesday\u2019s earnings call, Musk and CFO Vaibhav Taneja\u00a0said that the \u201cbig beautiful bill\u201d recently passed by Congress would affect Tesla\u2019s business.

Tesla management said it started limited production of the more affordable model in June and expects to ramp it up in the second half of the year.\n\nStill, the outlook for the rest of the year remains murky as Tesla didn\u2019t provide any official guidance, a departure from earlier this year, when the company said growth would return in 2025.\n\n\u201cManagement initially guided for deliveries growth in 2025,\u201d Seth Goldstein, an analyst at Morningstar, said in a note on Wednesday. \u201cWe interpret no guidance as a signal that management is no longer forecasting volume growth.

    "selftext": "That's right ...Trump just announced that he will impose a 50% tariff on copper, effective August 1, 2025, citing a \u201cnational security assessment.\u201d\n\nIn his statement, he bombastically emphasized the importance of copper to the country: copper is the second most used material in the Department of Defense. How can we let \u2018sleepy leaders\u2019 destroy this industry? It's time to rebuild America's copper industry. This is our golden age!\n\nWhat this means for the market (personal opinion): Copper prices could be about to spike (again) Copper (HG=F) has bounced around $4.50/lb last week. Once the tariffs hit the ground, expect importers to stock up ahead of time and copper mining stocks to put in a rally. Focus: Freeport-McMoRan ($FCX), Southern Copper ($SCCO), Teck ($TECK), as well as small-caps Taseko ($TGB), Copper Mountain ($CPPMF).\n\nRisk of rising short-term inflationary pressures \n\nCopper is widely used in construction, data centers, electric vehicles, power grids, and defense.\n\n50% tariffs = higher costs = could push up cost transmission effects in industrial and tech supply chains.\n\nNew energy, EV sectors could be under pressure \n\nTesla ($TSLA), Enphase ($ENPH), Azure ($NIO), etc. could face higher raw material costs.\n\nEnergy storage and battery businesses will have their margins squeezed if they haven't hedged copper prices in advance.\n\nDefense contractors may be forced to strain \n\nRTX, LMT, NOC, and others rely on copper for radar, missile, and flight systems.\n\nWith tariffs raising domestic copper prices, these companies may either lobby the government or turn to local supply chains.\n\nMy personal view: \n\nShort term? Bullish on copper mining stocks, bearish on rising manufacturing costs \n\nMedium term? Watch inflation and Fed policy feedback \n\nLong term? This is clearly a big election year move, with lots of policy variables and no shortage of volatility\n\nIncidentally: if copper prices continue to rise, it may be harder for the Fed to cut rates as a result - a potential impact variable for the stock market as a whole.\n\nWould also like to hear your thoughts: \n\nDo you think this is a pre-election bluff? Or will Congress really follow through?\n\nHas anyone started laying out copper futures or options yet?\n\nIs this just short term volatility or the beginning of a major style switch in industrial stocks? Not investment advice. Just a guy who stares at copper futures every day like it's an EKG.",

Also stated preliminary data suggests 2025 EPS would be about $2.75 less than previous estimates (expected adjusted EPS of $7.25 in April). Withdrew earnings guidance. Overall a brutal selloff, looking to see if there's a bounce in this somewhere. Not interested in this short. The Big Beautiful Bill proposes significant cuts to Medicaid, totaling approximately $1 trillion over the next decade, affecting the economics of healthcare providers drastically. OSCR moving on this as well. \n\n[**UNH (UnitedHealth)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=UNH&p=d)\\-Overall has seen a decent boost over the past few days; UNH has less exposure than CNC to Medicare (thus less affected by future cuts) so BBB won't affect it as much. We are seeing a minor selloff that I think could continue further due to ADP jobs numbers. There are a ton of risks in this (DOJ Probe, regulators, scrutiny of practices, etc), but those are mainly long-term risks. \n\n[**HOOD (Robinhood)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=HOOD&p=d)\\- HOOD has been on a tear, reaching $99 yesterday, mainly driven by the company's aggressive push into global products. They launched some kind of US/ETF tokes in Europe (from what I've read it's a very convenient way to dodge regulation lol). Overall mainly concerned that regulators will strike this down, but HOOD has news literally every other day so if I am incorrect on what fueled this move please let me know. \n\n[**TSLA (Tesla)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TSLA&p=d)\\-TSLA fell around 5% yesterday following Musk's criticism of BBB that could eliminate EV tax credits, potentially costing Tesla $1.2B annually. Additionally, TSLA reported Q2 global deliveries (which have spiked the stock up 5%). Overall car numbers were reported 14% decline in vehicle deliveries. Also keep in mind Trump tweeted yesterday about deporting Musk (lol), which caused quite a bit of volatility. ",

    "selftext": "I know when a company is at a bargain to buy. Problem is, I know when to buy, but I don\u2019t know when to sell. Do I sell when I need the money or when doctor tells me I only got a month to live? \n\nLet me give you several examples:\n\nI was able to buy lots of Celsius stocks at $8 basis in 2020 when I began trying their drinks, enjoyed it and began seeing Celsius drinks sold everywhere at grocery markets and convenience stores. I felt confident. Celsius rose all the way to $95, the stock split and dropped all the way back to $25. Obviously, I did not sell any.\n\nSame thing applies to FSLY, SQ, SE when I did not sell at the peak and watched them drop all the way back to my entry price then I panic sold and only secured a very little gain.\n\nSMCI - I also panic sold at $23.81 for small gain and obviously, watching the price going back up is lots of pain. \n\nI was able to buy lots of crowdstrike last year in July when the outage caused chaos within airport and various companies. I also scooped some UNH as well due to recent (to me, it\u2019s overreaction) free fall. \n\nI bought lots of ASTS at $11 and sold at $30 to get my entry money back. Then it went all the way to $46. \n\nLots of people say, if a stock gives you 25% to 50%, it makes sense for you to sell all, take the profit and run. It\u2019s not true at all. If you sold NVDA, TSLA, AMD and PLTR at 30% gain, you probably cried yourself to sleep every night. Some of the companies do have ten-fold potential if you decide to hold long. And selling them also subject yourself to short term capital gain tax. \n\nAlso, PLTR PE ratio skyrockets. I understand military contract and AI reliance are legit, but there\u2019s no guarantee for price to hold. When is a good time to sell? Which companies have bright future to hold strong despite free fall? Nobody has a crystal ball I understand but does reading business financial statement and learning their fundamental/ business model/ ecological system gives you a clue? \n\nMarket is at ATH carried by major techs due to AI replacing humans leading to boost in company\u2019s profit margin and future earning potential. But correction will eventually come. \n\nI need investing veterans to give me some guidances here?

Any early layouts for this wave?\n\nDo you think this peace deal is sustainable, or is it just a \u201cpaper peace\u201d?\n\nBigger question: does this mean that China is loosening its grip on key minerals?",

Despite the miss on earnings, the NKE CEO expressed cautious optimism, stating that while improvements are expected, a full recovery remains distant (mainly due to tariffs which he said would have a $1B impact). Also forecasted \\~5% Q1 sales decline, a better outlook than the 7% drop forecasted. Interested in seeing if this breaks $70 today. Sportswear and LULU have been inconsistent in recovery from tariffs, interested to see if LULU moves (and has potentially recovery) from this.\n\n[**OKLO (Oklo Inc)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=OKLO&p=d)\\- Reportedly, the Trump administration is preparing executive actions to enhance energy infra and AI. The administration will release an \"AI Action Plan\" on July 23. These measures aim to address grid congestion, permitting delays, by declaring a national energy emergency. I'm seeing OKLO move off this but I'm interested other nuclear energy stocks as well. OKLO failed to break $60 in premarket but interested in watching further.\n\n[**NVDA (NVIDIA)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&p=d)\\-NVDA hit an all-time high along with the market, as the U.S. and China agreed on a trade framework and Iran/Israel tensions de-escalated. Momentum has continued as macro fears (mainly from Israel/Iran) die down and AI infrastructure investment remains elevated (CRWV acquiring CORZ). Interested in seeing if NVDA can hold above prior day's low ($153.49), momentum is pretty sustained and the move can continue far longer than anyone can expect. Since the trade framework with China was agreed upon, the next catalyst I'm potentially interested in is lifting of chip restrictions in China. \n\n[**PONY (Pony AI)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=PONY&p=d)/UBER- UBER is reportedly in talks to support Travis Kalanick\u2019s acquisition of the US arm of Pony AI. A successful deal would reintroduce Kalanick to the self-driving space, and potentially integrate autonomous capabilities within Uber\u2019s broader platform strategy. News happened yesterday, and we don't typically see further movement but I'm interested if there's a competing bid. LYFT/TSLA didn't move off this so not too interested.",

    "selftext": ">The artificial intelligence company has set many challenging goals. Autonomous vehicle software is now among them - but may pit the company against Tesla.\n\n>\n\n>Sam Altman has made many big claims about what OpenAI will be able to do, including spearheading ultra-expansive data centers and building artificial intelligence that can rival the abilities of Ph.D. holders.\n\n>But he also recently made a significant, yet largely overlooked, assertion. OpenAI is seeking to crack the code for advanced autonomous driving.\n\n>\u201cWe have some new technology that could just do self-driving for standard cars way better than any current approach has worked,\u201d Altman said last week on the \u201cUncapped With Jack Altman\u201d podcast, which his brother hosts. Altman added, \u201cIf our A.I. techniques can really go drive a car, that\u2019s pretty cool.\u201d\n\n>The technology is in its early stages - DealBook hears that it involves both OpenAI\u2019s Sora video software and its robotics team - but commercializing it is still a distant goal. An OpenAI spokesman declined to comment.\n\n>That could make Altman even more of a competitor to Elon Musk, who co-founded OpenAI but has since waged war on the company. (A short reminder: Musk has sued to try to stop OpenAI from revamping its corporate structure, and he\u2019s building a direct competitor, xAI, that\u2019s raising - and spending - billions of dollars.)\n\n>Autonomous vehicles are key to Musk\u2019s vision for Tesla, which he increasingly sees as the producer of huge fleets of fully self-driving cars. Tesla is focusing on A.I.-powered vision rather than on the array of sensors like lidar that Waymo, a Google spinoff, uses.\n\n>One big question mark for OpenAI: Where will its systems get their data? Tesla and Waymo have already amassed huge amounts of information and video through their years of driving on the roads.\n\n>That raises the question of whether OpenAI believes in a fundamentally different approach to self-driving tech, one that relies less on real-world data and more on advanced simulation, synthetic data or a breakthrough in \u201cgeneralizable\u201d A.I. Of note: The company recently collaborated with Applied Intuition, a start-up focused on putting A.I. in cars.\n\n>(OpenAI\u2019s venture arm also invested in Ghost Autonomy, a self-driving start-up, though the business folded last year.)\n\n>\u201cI think he really gets it,\u201d Altman said of President Trump\u2019s approach to A.I. (Altman has forged close ties to the president, including by donating to his inauguration fund and announcing the Stargate data center project at the White House.) \u201cI think he really understands the importance of leadership in this technology.\u201d\n\n>Altman was uncertain about whether the right A.I. regulations would come to pass: \u201cI have become a bit more, jaded isn\u2019t the right word, but it\u2019s something in that direction, about the ability of policymakers to grapple with the speed of technology.\u201d\n\n>Altman played down reports of tensions between OpenAI and Microsoft as they rework their relationship: \u201cDo you believe that, when you read those things?\u201d\n\nLink: [https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/25/business/dealbook/openai-autonomous-vehicles-musk-tesla.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/25/business/dealbook/openai-autonomous-vehicles-musk-tesla.html)",

This just goes to show how much valuation and time matter. A great company can have a wildly inaccurate price and you are left with nothing while it grows into its valuation.\n\nAlso worth noting their revenue has been completely flat since reporting Q2 of 2023 while gross profit has fallen by ~20%. Their net earnings per share has collapsed 50% during this time.\n\nLots of the last 2 years have been when Musk was involved with his politics. Maybe he can turn it around now, but either way, the current valuation does not leave much room for any sort of stock price appreciation.

I am targeting potentially good candidates for short-term trading; I have no opinion on them as investments. The potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting, everything else is secondary.\n\nToday is mainly second-day movers from news yesterday.\n\nNews: [Iran Israel War Updates](https://apnews.com/live/iran-israel-war-updates-6-24-2025)\n\n[**TSLA (Tesla)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TSLA&p=d)\\- NHTSA pressed Tesla for more information after robotaxi incidents caught on camera showed lane departures and speeding in Austin (this hasn't actually moved the stock but interesting to see how this ultimately plays out). TSLA surged massively yesterday (325->359) because of the robotaxi launch on Sunday, and streamers caught some traffic violations. Most obvious catalyst here is if regulators pull Robotaxi out of Austin, but I doubt that will happen. Also interseted to see if we move up for a second day. \n\n[**USO (United States Oil Fund)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=USO&p=d)/[**XLE (Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=XLE&p=d)\\-President Trump accused both Israel and Iran of violating a ceasefire he helped broker yesterday. We saw the market move up yesterday (and oil fall) due to Trump saying that the Israel and Iran conflict was set to end in a ceasefire. This may be a telegraphed move to say that the ceasefire might not hold. If so then we may see a surge in oil if the conflict continues and the market fall. Overall I'm mainly interested in the moves of oil because this actually hasn't budged VIX too much. \n\n[**CRCL (Circle)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=CRCL&p=d)\\-Crypto \u201crules of the road\u201d framework unveiled by Senators. The bipartisan GENIUS Act passed the Senate 68\u201330 to regulate stableCs. CRCL moved up to $299 yesterday and then sell off after a MASSIVE move since the IPO- I think that the selloff from the move was saved primarily due to Trump's announcement of the Iran/Israel ceasefire (which caused the entire market to move up). We might see another selloff today- still short biased in this and not interested in this long. \n\nRandom risks I'm thinking of that could kill momentum: The bill now has to pass the House; dilution by the STABLE Act could change issuer oversight, and international competition (Tether) could beat this in the longrun. \n\n[**NTRS (Northern Trust Corp)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NTRS&p=d)\\-Northern Trust shares surged Friday \\~8% after reports that Bank of New York Mellon approached the company about a potential merger. Overall wasn't an extremely interesting catalyst but NTRS said they're committed to remaining independent, so we may see additional updates on this.

UBS thinks Robotaxi's upside may have factored in a \\~$99 share price premium \n\nRegulatory risk: Texas has made it clear that licenses are required by September, and there have already been some fines for non-compliance \n\nMusk risk: public opinion swirls  protesters  and political pressures are all over the place Investors can easily get scared \n\nValuation is still expensive: even if it's profitable now, TSLA is still trading at a valuation of 170x 2025 expected profits. It's already outrageous \n\nTSLA is currently trading around $349 with intraday volume of \\~176 million shares The trading range of $323-$357.5 is approaching the technical pressure level of $360-$370 \n\nIn a nutshell: the launch of Robotaxi is indeed a big positive The stock has surged by about 8-10%  Currently oscillating at $349 but a lot of the good has already been reflected \n\nLong view: this is a real turning point  Revenue modeling, branding, voice, and execution are all perfect scores  If technology and regulation keep up  it could continue to fly\n\nShort view: valuation is too high  public opinion is too risky, and policy is too unstable  so it's not uncommon for the market to sell the news at any time  so it's not uncommon to see the market go higher\n\n\n\nDo you think Robotaxi is a real long term change or a short term hype?\n\nAnyone planning to wait for a pullback ($320-330) before getting in?

But investors and the world are watching global affairs, too.\n\nMeanwhile, several market-driving events are due in the coming days. The Federal Reserve's interest rate decision, consumer spending data, and possible news on President Donald Trump's tariffs headline the week. Thursday's Juneteenth holiday will mean a break from trading.\n\nThe Fed will hand down another decision on interest rates this week, with a decision scheduled for Wednesday. The coming weekend could see Tesla providing a significant update on the direction of the electric vehicle maker.\n\nDid consumers in May continue to prop up the economy? Tuesday's U.S. retail sales will make it clear whether strong\u00a0spending levels continued, while housing construction data will provide insight into whether builders are catching up with lagging inventory levels. Investors will continue to watch for\u00a0trade developments\u00a0as negotiations continue between U.S. officials and key trading partners.\n\nIt\u2019s a light week for corporate earnings, highlighted by expected reports from homebuilder Lennar, accounting firm Accenture, grocery chain Kroger, and online used car seller CarMax.\n\n# Fed Interest-Rate Decision Comes Amid Increasing Pressure for Cuts\n\nFed officials have said they are keeping rates steady amid a strong labor market as they monitor inflation data for signs that Trump\u2019s tariffs are driving up prices.\n\nBut the pressure is on the Federal Reserve after\u00a0May inflation data\u00a0came in lower than economists expected. Despite\u00a0comments from President Donald Trump\u00a0urging the Fed to make a one-point cut, investors don't expect the central bank to take action when its two-day meeting concludes on Wednesday.\n\nThe\u00a0CME FedWatch Tool, which measures fed funds futures to determine the path of interest rates, indicates that traders overwhelmingly believe that Fed will keep rates at their current levels in June. They also don't expect the central bank to move rates at its late July meeting.\n\nAfter the meeting concludes on Wednesday,\u00a0Fed Chair Jerome Powell\u00a0will provide more insight into the central bank\u2019s view on the economy and interest rates when he takes media questions.\n\nOn Tuesday, retail sales figures from May will provide another barometer of the economy's health\u00a0Consumer spending\u00a0makes up about two-thirds of the U.S. economy. Meanwhile, housing data will also be scrutinized as affordability issues continue to depress home sales. The latest homebuilder confidence reading on Tuesday will show if construction industry officials see improvements coming in the market, while Wednesday\u2019s housing starts data will indicate whether construction levels are rising amid a\u00a0need for more housing inventory.\n\n# Tesla Robotaxi Rollout Could Come as Early as Sunday\n\nAfter months of waiting, investors could soon get a key update from electric vehicle maker Tesla (TSLA). CEO Elon Musk said in a recent social media post that the company could roll out its robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, as\u00a0early as Sunday, June 22. \"We are being super paranoid about safety, so the date could shift,\" Musk wrote.\n\nThe introduction of the company's robotaxi service could be a key moment for Tesla, which is banking on\u00a0artificial intelligence (AI)\u00a0and self-driving vehicles to become the transportation technologies of the future. Tesla is\u00a0well-positioned to lead the market\u00a0in the emerging technology, analysts have concluded, with Goldman Sachs writing that the EV maker could have a leg up on the competition through its ability to train self-driving through its AI development and to quickly scale production levels of the technology.\n\nDespite a light corporate earnings schedule this week, investors will still get some expected updates from noteworthy companies.\n\nLennar\u2019s (LEN) expected report after the bell on Monday follows the homebuilder's\u00a0warning of weakness\u00a0in the housing market in the prior quarter.\u00a0 The scheduled Friday reports from\u00a0accounting firm Accenture\u00a0(ACN) and\u00a0online car seller CarMax\u00a0(KMX) will be posted in the shadow of both companies' lower-than-expected profits in the prior quarter.\n\n# This Week\u2019s Calendar\n\n**Monday, June 16**\n\n* Data to Watch: Empire State manufacturing survey (June)\n* Key Earnings: Lennar\n\n**Tuesday, June 17**\n\n* U.S. retail sales (May)\n* Homebuilder confidence (June)\n* Key Earnings: Jabil (JBL), John Wiley & Sons (WLY), and La-Z-Boy (LZB)\n* More Data to Watch: Import/export price index (May), Industrial production/capacity utilization (May), Business inventories (April)\n\n**Wednesday, June 18**\n\n* Housing starts (May)\n* FOMC interest-rate decision\n* Federal Reserve Chair Powell press conference\n* Key Earnings: GMS (GMS)\n* More Data to Watch: Initial jobless claims (Week ending June 14)\n\n**Thursday, June 19**\n\n* Financial markets closed for the Juneteenth holiday\n* Key Earnings: Smith & Wesson Brands (SWBI)\n\n**Friday, June 20**\n\n* Leading economic indicators (May)\n* Key Earnings: Accenture, Kroger (KR), Darden Restaurants (DRI), and CarMax\n* More Data to Watch: Philadelphia Fed manufacturing survey (June)",

Trump, meanwhile, isn\u2019t interested in making up and warned Musk he could face \u201cserious consequences\u201d if he helps Democrats\n\nThis whole feud has Wall Street on edge, especially Tesla investors. Tesla\u2019s rollout of its robotaxi service in Austin is supposed to kick off June 22 but there\u2019s worry Trump might use federal regulators to slow things down kind of a political roadblock that could hit Tesla\u2019s growth hard\n\nTesla shares bounced back almost 2% early Wednesday, recovering some of last week\u2019s losses when the Musk-Trump drama blew up\n\nFrom an investor\u2019s perspective  how do you see this playing out? Does Musk\u2019s \u201csorry\u201d move calm the waters enough to keep Tesla on track? Or is the political heat going to keep putting a ceiling on Tesla\u2019s potential?",

Trump announced a 'done deal' in the rare earths deal, causing a small spike to the market premarket. The buying opportunity was the day of the tweets but obviously, still interesting to see if the Trump/Musk relationship can be completely repaired. It seems both sides are playing damage control and trying to repair the rift. There's been huge discontent from Musk due to Trump's \"Big Beautiful Bill,\" but we've moved from 325->275 ->335. MASSIVE move and trade of the month.\n\n[**OUST (Ouster)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=OUST&p=d)\\-Premarket announcement that the US Department of Defense approved its OS1 digital lidar sensor for use in unmanned aerial systems. Most of the move occurred premarket, but will be watching to see if we make another leg higher- the daily chart looks near parabolic if we move up again today/tomorrow with a move from 7.50 to 20 in the past month.\n\n[**CRWV (Coreweave)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=CRWV&p=d)\\- Staying surprisingly resilient at \\~$160, we've also seen upward momentum an hour before the open (154->160). Overall nothing too compelling for a short unless we rocket past 160 to something ludicrous, this has stayed up longer/stronger than CRCL so far more interested in this.\n\n[**ASTS (AST SpaceMobile)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=ASTS&p=d)\\-Somewhat still hovering fairly high from Jeff Bezos posting a picture that implied a partnership. This has diverged from RKLB's move up, and is still hovering around $36. Nothing too compelling unless we make a leg higher. Again, nothing confirmed from Bezos or Amazon, so the move may fade if no formal announcement follows.\n\n**Earnings today:** [**ORCL**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=ORCL&p=d)",

    "selftext": "Tesla appears to be undervalued given its potential to revolutionize the field of robotics for both business and personal use. Stock prices on Wall Street are based on expectations for the future; we must consider what the robotics world will soon look like.Robots have become an integral part of the automotive and semiconductor industries, but mass-produced autonomous robots could have a significant impact on society and Tesla stock.Despite personal concerns, the arrival of advanced robots seems inevitable and it is worth considering future investment opportunities. \n\nWill Tesla's (NASDAQ: TSLA) robots be the next smartphone device for the mass market? Will they have the same impact on society as smartphones? In this article, we'll look at the robots Tesla is developing and whether we can profit from this potential shift.\n\nTo some extent, Wall Street bases its judgment on future profit expectations for stock prices. When we think about future prospects, we have to think about what the world will look like in 3, 5, or 10 years and what will happen to stock prices? This is obviously a very difficult question to answer, but we can make reasonable predictions about the overall growth of the emerging humanoid robotics industry.\n\nIgnoring the risks posed by AI and robots to the survival of the species, we can probably assume that the short-term risk is that China will continue to dominate Chinese EV sales, and that Tesla could face a very tough time in the Chinese market. However, global sales of electric vehicles continue to grow. However, as EVs continue to grow, Tesla will need something to differentiate itself, and that's where self-driving cars might come into play. I guess we'll see if that will fully materialize, and for now, it looks like advanced testing will take place in Austin, Texas. Let's move on to the next issue.\n\nChina has a monopoly on rare earth elements used in Tesla robots and electric cars. The U.S. government needs to break that monopoly by heavily funding domestic resources. According to Reuters, President Trump may be on the verge of passing the Defense Production Act to fund critical and rare earth elements. Of course, we are currently in the midst of various political waves that are clashing between Elon and President Trump. Trying to predict what will happen between the two of them is futile as they are both unknowns, but it's just something to be aware of. Another risk factor is that Tesla currently has a lot of production in China. If relations with the U.S. deteriorate further, there could be repercussions. That's an unknown to keep an eye on.\n\nI think Tesla Robotics as well as solutions from NVIDIA, Amazon and China are on their way and will materialize in the next few years. Regarding the potential market size, according to a Reuters article, NVIDIA CEO Jen-Hsun Huang said, The age of robotics has arrived. People are paying attention. This is likely to be the biggest industry.\n\n\n\nSo will humanoid robots become as popular as smartphones? I think it's possible, and if we look at how Elon is transforming Optimus Prime in the factory, we'll have a clearer picture of the future in a few years.",

    "selftext": "I'm currently building a long-term investment portfolio with around $15,500 in USD. My approach is to combine strong exposure to tech and innovation with some international diversification. I've selected individual stocks like NVIDIA(15%) and AMD(10%) to capture growth in the AI and semiconductor space, and I've included TSLA(10%) as a way to gain exposure to the EV and energy transition sectors\u2014though I'm open to switching that position for aerospace and defense in the future, depending on market conditions.\n\nTo complement those, I'm using the Invesco Nasdaq 100 ETF (15%) for broader exposure to leading U.S. tech companies. I've also added the Franklin FTSE India ETF (10%) to capture long-term growth potential in emerging markets, particularly India. In addition, I've chosen a cybersecurity ETF (RIZE CYBR) (10%) to position myself in a sector that's increasingly critical, and I\u2019ve added a biotech ETF along with Moderna(15%)to diversify into healthcare innovation.\n\nBesides this USD portfolio, I hold 10,000 euros in the Vanguard Global Stock Index Fund. I plan to add 75 euros monthly to this fund, while saving another 75 euros each month as cash on the side, to take advantage of opportunities within my main portfolio or strengthen existing positions when there are dips.\n\nLastly, I\u2019m keeping around 35,000 euros in cash, which I plan to hold in a high-interest savings account or similar low-risk vehicle, with full liquidity in case I decide to make a property purchase in the near future.\n\nThis mix allows me to stay invested in sectors I believe in, while maintaining flexibility and liquidity for both opportunities and personal needs. Open to thoughts or suggestions on how to improve it.\n\n\\*Edit: \n\nMy current main questions:\n\n1. Can all this markets go up during 4 and a half years but suddenly on the 5th year go down? What's the point then holding long term? \n\n2. The longer you hold, the less a \"break down\" can affect your portfolio? For example: A general 40% down will make you lose money on year 5 but you will be \"strong enough\" at year 10 to still being positive eventhough the breakdown? \n\n3. I know \"time in the market > timing in the market\" but do you think it is a good week/month to enter? Nvidia for example is super high right now. \n\n4. If you hold for 10 years, but there's a big loss on year 10. Does that mean all those 9 years have been useless and you gotta start again? \n\n  \nSorry if the questions are too noob and thankyou for the feedback. ",

Cook will likely use the event to address the company's new products, services, and partnerships. GameStop could clarify its cryptocurrency strategy on the company's earnings call, set for Tuesday. Key companies in the growing\u00a0artificial intelligence (AI)\u00a0market are also scheduled to update investors on their financials during the week.\n\nA U.S. inflation report scheduled for Wednesday could indicate whether President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs are beginning to have an effect on the economy. The news follows a\u00a0healthy jobs report\u00a0Friday.\n\nAfter markets shook off trade tensions last week to bring the S&P 500\u00a0back above 6000, investors will keep an eye on tariffs as\u00a0Trump\u2019s deadline on trade deals approaches.

Fed officials are in their blackout period ahead of their next two-day meeting, which begins June 17.\n\nTrump\u2019s tariffs\u00a0will be a key topic in Friday\u2019s consumer sentiment report, which dropped for four straight months before\u00a0leveling out in May. Consumers are\u00a0consistently worried\u00a0that tariffs will drive inflation higher, sending the closely watched survey to some of its lowest readings since the pandemic.

The company, which\u00a0fired up the meme stock craze\u00a0in 2021 with its meteoric rise, announced in late May that it\u00a0bought $500 million in bitcoin. With its\u00a0retail video game business in decline, GameStop looks to emulate the playbook of Michael Saylor\u2019s Strategy (MSTR) and other companies\u00a0centering their business models on buying bitcoin.\n\nAI will be a key theme in other corporate earnings this week.

    "title": "My Thesis on TSLA ($295.14) and CRWV ($140.16)",
    "selftext": "***This is a multi-signal analysis***, built by synthesizing options flow data, sentiment, company fundamentals, and technical structure. I'm focusing on setups where multiple signals converge. Not just one off price moves or just pure TA.\n\nWe all know about the Elon Musk vs. Trump drama that's playing out in public. On June 5, $TSLA dropped nearly 14% in a single session. That was its largest one day drop since March 2020.\n\nThis wasn\u2019t a move based on earnings or fundamentals. It was event driven and sentiment driven. And it came with record put volume. There were over 4 million contracts traded. This is pointing to either panic hedging or high conviction short bets. That kind of volume typically leads to short term dislocation.\n\nOn June 6, TSLA rebounded +3.7%, showing early signs of stabilization. That bounce came on strong volume, which adds weight to the reversion thesis.\n\n**Entry Zone:**  \n$285\u2013$288 is a key support zone. A clean hold or reclaim above $300 with volume reactivates the bounce thesis.\n\n**Target Zone:**  \n$305\u2013$318, especially if the political overhang fades and sentiment resets.\n\n**Danger Zone:**  \nAvoid entries if price retests below $280 without reversal. This could lead to further downside.\n\nNow looking at CoreWeave ($CRWV):\n\nCRWV IPO\u2019d in March and ran from \\~$57 (May 13) to \\~$163 by June 4. This was a 185% move in just three weeks. That\u2019s a classic parabolic extension.\n\nIt pulled back on June 5 to \\~$135 and closed June 6 at $140.16. So far, this looks more like the first real cooling off period than a full reversal.\n\nOptions flow is mixed. There's still aggressive call activity at $150\u2013$160, but we\u2019re also seeing increasing open interest in the $130 and $120 puts. That split usually signals uncertainty. Some still chasing upside, others starting to hedge or fade.\n\n**Entry Zone:**  \nWatching $130\u2013$134. That was prior resistance and could act as support if price compresses there. If it reclaims $145 with strength, the setup for a retest of the highs becomes viable.\n\n**Target Zone:**  \n$155\u2013$160, but only if price gets back above $145 on volume.\n\n**Danger Zone:**  \nA breakdown below $125 likely triggers a deeper unwind. Watching $114\u2013$118 as the next volume shelf.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nTSLA looks like a higher confidence reversion setup. The size of the flush, the record flow, and the bounce all point to a dislocation that can snap back. CRWV is more speculative. It's a momentum name cooling off after a vertical run. It's tradable, but only with confirmation.\n\nWould love to hear how others are approaching these. Especially if you\u2019re tracking the same flows or setups.\n\n***Not financial advice***",

Looking for the second day trade in this- we saw TSLA go to a low of $275 yesterday, so I'm interested to see if we continue selling off or make at least some attempt at recovery. Trump/Musk are expected to speak today to \"cool things down\". This spat is mainly political, another issue to add along with the rest. Musk did threaten to stop work on the Dragon Capsule, Trump threatened to stop all of TSLA/SpaceX's government contracts, causing the stock to fall 50 points throughout the day.\n\n[**VERA (Vera)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=VERA&p=d)\\- VERA fell 30% after competitor Otsuka reported superior Phase 3 trial results for its IgA nephropathy drug, sibeprenlimab, which achieved a 51.2% reduction in proteinuria compared to Vera's atacicept's 46% reduction. We had seen VERA actually spike up due to their drug report a few days back from $20 ->$37 on this news- it's possible that it'll just stay flat at pre-drug release price.\n\n[**CRCL (Circle)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=CRCL&p=d)\\- Watching the $100 level for potential breakout or breakdown. I regret not writing a DD for this but I was taking a break. We opened at \\~2.5x multiple to the original IPO price and surged past $100 briefly in the first few minutes of trading, we've stayed pretty strong/sustained up since then. I'm interested to see if we can stay fairly at this level. I'm mainly interested in this because CRCL is one of the first listed stable C's on a US listing, and we've seen HUGE interest in recent catalysts that are related to this space/industry.\n\n[**ASTS (AST SpaceMobile)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=ASTS&p=d)\\- ASTS surged over 13% amid speculation of a potential partnership or investment from Amazon, following social media posts featuring AST's CEO and Jeff Bezos. AMZN is beginning commercialization of its Project Kuiper initiative, a satellite-based project that will deliver retail wireless broadband to Earth (competitor to Starlink). There was a research report released that speculates ASTS's RF wireless service could complement Kuiper's broadband technology, and therefore make sense for an acquisition by AMZN. Regardless of how plausible you think an acquisition this is, this was driven all by a single picture and speculation. So be careful of volatility if nothing happens.",

KILL the BILL,\" Musk\u00a0posted on X\u00a0on Wednesday.\n\nMusk\u00a0added, \"If the massive deficit spending continues, there will only be money for interest payments and nothing else!\"\n\nThe vocal criticism is irking Trump, the\u00a0Wall Street Journal\u00a0reported, with a senior official claiming that White House advisors were \"caught off guard\" by Musk's latest broadsides.\n\nTesla stock fell solidly on Wednesday and extended those losses in premarket trading on Thursday, down as much as 3%.\n\nThe comments come after the one-time leader of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) waded earnestly into the debate over the bill this week,\u00a0angrily\u00a0posting Tuesday that it was a \"disgusting abomination.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry, but I just can't stand it anymore. This massive, outrageous, pork-filled Congressional spending bill is a disgusting abomination,\" he said.\n\n\"Shame on those\" who voted for it in the House, Musk added.\n\nBloomberg reported that Musk may also be driven by the fact that the\u00a0federal EV tax credit is being phased out by the bill, as he fought hard to keep it in place as a key driver for Tesla's business.\n\nMusk's barrage comes as the bill faces an uncertain future in the Senate, and a\u00a0Congressional Budget Office estimation\u00a0of its impact on the deficit adds fuel to Musk's line of argument.\n\nThe nonpartisan office projected the House-passed version of the bill would add $2.4 trillion to deficits over the next 10 years.\n\nThe formerly Musk-led DOGE itself has been criticized for not producing the budgetary cuts Musk touted it could find, and the cuts it has produced have been deeply unpopular.\n\nMusk's closeness to the Trump administration had been seen as a boon for Tesla, given its business with SpaceX and NASA and the regulatory levers the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration could pull in getting autonomous driving rules in place for Tesla's robotaxi testing.\n\nRead more:\u00a0How to avoid the sticker shock on Tesla car insurance\n\nBut demand weakness in the EU and recent protests at US Tesla showrooms have followed Musk's controversial foray into politics, causing\u00a0some Tesla owners to become alienated\u00a0by Musk, specifically by his right-leaning tendencies, DOGE, and outward support of President Trump.\n\nTesla's big robotaxi test is slated for June 12 in Austin. Much of the company's value is tied to whether it can fully unlock autonomous driving for robotaxi purposes and individual owners.\n\nMeanwhile, Alphabet's (GOOG,\u00a0GOOGL) Waymo continues to plow ahead and is essentially the leader in the space, accumulating\u00a0250,000 robotaxi trips per week.",

The court stated they lacked a valid national emergency justification and infringed upon congressional powers. We saw a huge move in the market afterhours yesterday, mainly interested to see if we can continue the move. Is the tariff madness over? Absolutely not, but I'm interested in seeing if we keep momentum upwards. \n\n[**NVDA (NVIDIA)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&p=d)\\-NVDA reported Q1 revenue of $44.1B, with data center revenue at $39.1B vs $39.3B exp. The company said that guidance would have been $8B higher except for lost sales from the China restriction on H20 chips. I was mainly interested in the $140 level yesterday and we blew past that afterhours yesterday. Overall, great earnings report with further hopes that China restriction is lifted. Not too interested in  Keep in mind that ATH is \\~$152.\n\n[**ELF (e.l.f. Beauty)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=ELF&p=d)\\-ELF announced the acquisition of Hailey Bieber's skincare brand, Rhode, in a deal valued up to $1B. The transaction is $600M cash/$200M in stock, and potential $200M earnout based on Rhode's growth over the next three years. This ended up reversing ELF's earnings report yesterday (which was negative due to the thread of tariffs), and signaled that ELF is moving into skincare. We've made a pretty huge move up to $105.\n\n[**TSLA (Tesla)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TSLA&p=d)\\-Tesla plans to launch its robotaxi service in Austin on June 12, utilizing driverless Model Y vehicles. Elon Musk also confirmed he is leaving the government DOGE initiative and will focus on the company. This has been on a tear for the past month- that break from the $300 level was what I was most interested in, interested if we set up again for $375/$400. The launch of its robotaxi service is another way to signal that it's challenging Waymo, but whether it will succeed without LIDAR or not is another question. Regulation news/catalysts are the biggest potential movers of the robotaxis news.",

The reports come as recent surveys show that\u00a0consumers\u2019 moods have soured\u00a0over concerns that tariffs will drive prices higher.

All that matters is the potential for a revenue increase at an unknown date in the future. Look at quantum stocks, they are wildly overvalued by standard metrics. But they continue to fly higher. Why? Because at some point in the next 10-20 years they will earn more revenue than they do today. \n\nLook at CRWV, burning cash but promises to have future revenue (because companies who need ai compute capacity will never build out their own capacity right?), so it will continue to go up in a straight line.

If things get dire the government will just offer mild tariff relief if other countries agree to buy up massive amounts of US bonds and treasuries. The system will never fail, stop betting that it will.\n\nThe moral of the story here is simple, shorting never works. Period. Stocks that go down will go up more in the future. Because everyone believes that buying the dip works, it works. And it always will. This is likely very annoying for a lot of people who think valuations are high etc. If you are one of those people just give up. This time IS different. The globe has been conditioned to buy the dip. It will never stop. So join the herd or get run over by it. ",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone \u2013 just saw some big news. Elon Musk announced that Tesla (TSLA) is launching a self-driving ride-hailing service in Austin, TX. It\u2019ll start with about 10 vehicles and scale up to 1,000 within a month. He also mentioned a goal of having 1 million fully autonomous vehicles in operation by the end of next year.\n\nThe service will be geo-fenced for safety and allow Tesla owners to rent out their autonomous cars, similar to Uber or Airbnb\u2019s model.\n\nTSLA stock jumped over 3.5% intraday on the news, while competitors like Uber (UBER) and Lyft (LYFT) dipped 1\u20132%, showing how seriously the market is taking Tesla\u2019s expansion into ride-hailing.\n\nIf you believe in the long-term potential of autonomous mobility and tech disruption, this might be a major growth driver for TSLA. Definitely something to keep an eye on.\n\n*Not financial advice. Do your own research before investing.*",

The probe, active since at least last summer, is looking into \"questionable diagnoses\" to inflate payments from Medicare. UNH dropped close to 40 points yesterday afterhours. Not sure if it'll continue but short biased unless we make some insane move downward even more. The spike premarket was attributed to them denying the news. This news is particularly bad because DOJ confirmed investigation is criminal. Other stocks such as HUM/CVS/CI have moved on this as well.\n\n[**ETOR (eToro)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=ETOR&p=d) \\- eToro's IPO priced at \\~$68 per share, above the expected range of $46\u2013$50, and the stock bounced off \\~$65 off some strong bids. Mainly interested to see if the strong bids at $65 still exist (unlikely but I'll just keep an eye out anyway). Mainly a sector play in C-brokerages and the C-Market, since most of their income is derived from it. Beyond what I highlighted in the IPO analysis post, not interested in this long term. Probably will just trade as a proxy to the C-market in the future and I don't like the structure of their contract for diffs.\n\n[**BABA (Alibaba)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=BABA&p=d) \\- Alibaba reported Q4 revenue of 236.45B yuan, a 7% increase year-over-year, but slightly below analyst expectations of 237.91B yuan. Income from operations nearly doubled to 28.47B yuan driven by improved efficiency and reduced share-based compensation. This has been on a decent run since April 8th (peak fear tariff selloffs). Watching $125 level. Alibaba's cloud division saw an 18% revenue increase, with AI-related product sales posting triple-digit growth.\n\n[**FL (Foot Locker)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=FL&p=d) \\- Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods (DKS) confirmed a $2.4B acquisition of Foot Locker at $24 per share, nearly double Foot Locker's previous closing price. Currently long and interested in seeing if we can converge even closer to $24, but overall don't see any other trade in this except for a reversal of news. Mainly integration challenges and potential antitrust concerns are the big risk, but unlikely with current admin.\n\n[**TSLA (Tesla)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TSLA&p=d) \\- Tesla's stock has risen from $275 to $350 over the past six days but failed to break the $350 level twice. Currently short pretty close to $350, but will bail if we break $350 (probably a lower price level like $345). TSLA has mainly been on a tear (attributed to Musk stepping away from DOGE and returning to TSLA), and the news of Tesla board exploring a new pay deal for the CEO dropped yesterday. Mainly a short play based on how parabolic the stock has been, but will bail as needed.",

Additionally, the Trump administration is considering a deal that would allow the UAE to purchase over a million NVDA AI chips, easing previous export restrictions. This caused NVDA to skyrocket 10 points yesterday, watching for additional momentum today. Interested if we can make an equivalent move today and if the trend is strong, might buy a little if so- note that NVDA has earnings on 5/28. Overall interesting that NVDA is finding sales outside of China, but not sure if the ME can make up the shortfall.\n\n[**TSLA (Tesla)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TSLA&p=d)\\- TSLA has been on a tear ever since Musk has stepped away from DOGE, going from $275 -> $340 in 5 days. Was watching this since $300, the next major level I'm watching is $350- considering how we exploded upwards after the election, not very enthusiastic to short this unless we go to stupidly high levels like $400+. So for now, biased long. Musk has been controversially politically but the stock performance did hinge on his presence at the company, so interested to see if this is going to blow everyone out of the water shorting it (eg me) like last time lol. \n\n[**UNH (UnitedHealth Group)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=UNH&p=d)\\- UnitedHealth Group's CEO Andrew Witty has stepped down, and the company has suspended its 2025 forecast due to higher-than-expected medical costs, leading to a massive selloff yesterday. We dropped close to 70 points yesterday, I was personally hoping for the selloff to reach $300 but ultimately didn't get that far. Bought a little around $310 but will kick this out by selling calls against it because volatility is high. UNH has been through... a lot this year with Luigi and the CEO shooting, the proposed AI to analyze healthcare claims, and now this. We've fallen close to 40% after the *new* CEO stepped down as well. Expecting a small dead-cat bounce and a small slow recovery today, other than that not sure how they're going to navigate out of this.\n\n[**SMCI (Supermicro)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SMCI&p=d)\\- Supermicro has announced a multi-year $20B partnership with Saudi data center firm DataVolt to deliver GPU platforms and cooling systems for AI campuses in Saudi Arabia and the United States.

    "selftext": "I say Tesla (TSLA) has an upside of 1000% over the next 5-10 years. First Musk will perfect his robots in Tesla plants, and then he will replace the vast majority of Tesla auto factory workers with robots. Tesla's EV's will be the hands-down cheapest and best American electric vehicles, due to greatly reduced labor costs. Maybe Tesla cars won't sell well for a while, you say, because \"everyone hates Musk\". That's ok, with whatever Tesla vehicles don't sell, Musk will simply deploy them all as massive fleets of electric self-driving robotaxis that start undercutting Uber and Lyft all over America. There will soon be an energy crisis due to mass proliferation of AI GPU's, and electric vehicles. The fastest easiest solution to increase energy production incrementally is guess what...? SOLAR.  So then Tesla will make a killing by selling its state-of-the-art solar panels, and Chinese solar panels won't be able to compete in America, thanks to Trump tariffs. If skyrocketing silver prices becomes an issue, Musk will simply buy some silver mines like he said he might. Meantime, the Big-3 American Auto makers will be forced to replace their workforce with robots from Tesla, in order to lower their vehicle prices to compete with the cheaper and superior Tesla autos. Or maybe the Big-3 won't abandon UAW, and they'll all sink together. Either way Tesla wins. Musk will make sure worker robots are sold gradually in a strategic fashion, determining the Winners \\[those who are allowed to purchase worker robots first, before competitors are allowed\\] and Losers \\[those who aren't allowed (or don't want to) purchase robots, and are forced to stick with American human labor\\].",

Total revenue declined 9% year-over-year, with automotive revenue dropping 20% to $14B. Net income fell 71% to $409M, or $0.12 per share. The company attributed the decline to factory retooling for the refreshed Model Y, lower average selling prices, and increased sales incentives.

Whether this will actually hold and be his stance going forward is entirely up to him (he changed his mind a lot during 2019's trade wars). Assuming that the market holds up today, I'm primarily watching my current positions in NVDA/AAPL and ready to flip short if we make some ridiculously unsustainable move or if Trump changes his mind.\n\n[**LLY (Eli Lilly)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=LLY&p=d)\\-Filed lawsuits against four telehealth companies for selling unauthorized compounded versions of its GLP-1 drugs, Mounjaro and Zepbound. (LLY's diabetes drug Mounjaro went into short supply in 2022, allowing pharmacies and outsourcing facilities to produce the treatment, a practice called compounding). These drugs generated over $16.4B in revenue last year. Interestingly enough I see this case as pretty major despite not moving the stock significantly today, deciding whether GLP-1 is essentialy \"genericized\" to the point where any company can sell it or only the original developers of the drug. NVO might face the same thing in the future. If LLY loses, that's a huge blow for both of them.\n\n[**HTZ (Hertz)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=HTZ&p=d)\\-The potential rollback of tariffs by the Trump administration could negatively impact Ackman's thesis that used cars are more valuable due to tariffs. The stock is nearing $9, the previous high when the tariff news was announced. I'm interested in shorting the stock if we make a parabolic move up or if we fail to break $9 (but as always, it's dependent on how we get there).

The president\u2019s sweeping tariffs plan has led to concerns that costs will increase for parts and materials crucial for electric vehicle production, including manufacturing equipment,\u00a0automotive glass, printed circuit boards and battery cells.\n\nTesla shares are down 41% so far in 2025, and suffered their worst quarterly drop since 2022 in the period that ended in March. The stock was little changed in extended trading on Tuesday.\n\nThe company refrained from promising growth this year and said it will \u201crevisit our 2025 guidance in our Q2 update.\u201d\n\nIn its shareholder deck, Tesla cautioned investors that \u201cuncertainty in the automotive and energy markets continues to increase as rapidly evolving trade policy adversely impacts the global supply chain and cost structure of Tesla and our peers.\u201d The company said this \u201cdynamic,\u201d and \u201cchanging political sentiment\u201d could have a meaningful near-term impact on demand for its products.\n\nTesla has faced widespread protests in the U.S. and Europe, where Musk has actively supported Germany\u2019s far-right AfD party. Earlier this month, the company\u00a0reported\u00a0a 13% decline in first quarter deliveries from a year earlier to 336,681.\n\nTesla has been struggling to keep pace with lower-cost competitors in China, and is a laggard in the robotaxi market, which is currently dominated in the U.S. by\u00a0Alphabet\u2019s\u00a0Waymo. The company has promised to launch its\u00a0first driverless ride-hailing offering\u00a0in Austin, Texas, in June.\n\nThe company reassured investors on Tuesday that it remains on track for a \u201cpilot launch\u201d in Austin by that point, and to begin building its humanoid robots on a pilot production line in Fremont, California, this year.\n\nOperating income in the quarter slid 66% to $400 million from $1.17 billion a year earlier, resulting in a 2.1% operating margin. The company cited an increase in expenses tied to artificial intelligence projects as one factor in the decline.\n\nThe company would have lost money on automotive sales without environmental regulatory credits during the quarter. Revenue from the credits, which Tesla receives for selling fully electric vehicles, increased to $595 million from $432 million in the same quarter last year.\n\nEnergy generation and storage revenue jumped 67% in the quarter to $2.73 billion from $1.64 billion a year ago. The company said growth in AI infrastructure is \u201ccreating an outsized opportunity for our Energy storage products to stabilize the grid, shift energy when it is needed most and provide additional power capacity.\u201d\n\nTesla uses foreign suppliers for its energy business. The company said \u201cincreasing tariffs may cause market volatility and near-term impacts to supply and demand.\u201d\n\nSource: [Tesla (TSLA) earnings report Q1 2025](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/22/tesla-tsla-earnings-report-q1-2025.html)",

    "title": "Tesla Earnings: Two predictions and what to watch for after.",
    "selftext": "Position: I am short on Tesla.\n\nApparently, Elon is going to talk today: [Elon Musk breaks his own Tesla (TSLA) earnings rule in desperate move](https://electrek.co/2025/04/21/elon-musk-breaks-tesla-tsla-earnings-rule-desperate-move/)\n\nWe all know what this is about: Building hype to distract from the endless onslaught of bad news for Tesla. Elon is going to deploy his ERDF (Elon Reality Distortion Field) to pump up his meme stock. This comes as no surprise to anyone here. \n\nPrediction #1: Taking the likely prediction from the Tesla bulls, Elon will tell investors the same old story of Tesla becoming \"not-a-car-company\" anymore and to completely ignore all of 2025. (Source: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2025-largely-doesnt-matter-tesla-113124531.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2025-largely-doesnt-matter-tesla-113124531.html) ). Also, not really a big stretch of the imagination here. \n\nPrediction #2: Just for fun, I will make a very specific prediction of how Elon will use his ERDF to dazzle the mouth breathers into dumping more money into his meme stock. I expect that he will roll out the Optimus. It will do the following tasks, in order:\n\n1. Perform some silly preprogrammed maneuver that makes it look like it is self-aware. It will look at it's hands or something similar to make it look like it has \"intelligence\" and \"awareness\". Just watch the dumb video they have already put out there.\n2. Elon will throw a bunch of small, non-fragile, objects out on a flat surface and say: \"*Now watch this!*\". \n3. The robot will quickly grab each small object, maybe something like a domino, and arrange them quickly in an ordered fashion. It might even flick the first one to knock down the chain. \n4. Controlled remotely by a human off stage, the robot will wave goodbye to a choreographed verbal prompt from Elon and then walk off the stage. Maybe it will even do a little dance for us. \n5. The bleating sheep will go nuts and the stock will pop. \n6. End sham demo. \n7. Begin hand-waving and tech-jargon spewing to explain away endless mounting problems for Tesla. \n\nI predict this because of Elon's long history of stage-hyped vaporware demos. This will be really easy for him to pull off because they can just rip a few sensors and software out of the common pick-and-place robots already used in their production lines and quickly cobble them into the Optimus. It is going to look just like the pre-canned routines production robots run at manufacturing trade shows but for dimwits that have never been to one and think this is all \"new\" technology. \n\nMost importantly: This will gloss over the inconvenient fact that any \"brand damage\" Elon has caused Tesla, will also surely impact the sales of any other consumer product they will launch in the future. For example, an obscenely expensive robot that will likely be unable to scramble an egg for you. \n\nThe whole \"Tesla is not-a-car-company anymore\" earnings (so ignore the lack of earnings) show will also gloss over the fact that, like everything else \"new\" at Tesla, it is an old idea and they are way behind the competition (e.g., Waymo/Google in the Robotaxi space). The idea of a car company making humanoid robots was first put out there by Honda with ASIMO over a quarter century ago. They developed it. There was no consumer market for it. So, they repurposed it. There still isn't a consumer market here (longer discussion). And there is already a second generation of advanced humanoid robots for manufacturing from a company called [Figure building BMW's in Spartanburg, SC](https://www.bmwgroup.com/en/news/general/2024/humanoid-robots.html). Let's also just ignore all the more advanced humanoid robots coming out of China just like we are told to ignore BYD that just surpassed Tesla without even having access to the US market. If Elon says it's the future, it \"Musk\" be true, and Tesla will somehow be the ***only*** company in the world doing it. \n\nWill Tesla's stock pop today? Probably. But who really knows with any meme stock. Performance and numbers haven't mattered at all in the past for Tesla. Retail investors are just a herd of bleating sheep that will easily get caught up in the ERDF. What I am going to be looking for is 45 days\u00a0from the end of Q1 when the data from the 13F Forms comes out. Watching what the big institutional investors are doing will really be telling. I strongly suspect, given previous reports of retail investors buying up [Tesla like never before](https://www.investopedia.com/why-teslas-stock-soars-despite-car-sales-numbers-11705040), that the institutional investors are going to slowly reduce their positions in Tesla and orchastate themselves a nice soft landing on the backs of gullible retail investors. Given that institutional investors hold about half the company, I predict that this news is what will really drive the stock price for the foreseeable future. ",

    "selftext": "This is a daily watchlist for short-term trading: I might trade all/none of the stocks listed, and even stocks not listed! I am targeting potentially good candidates for short-term trading; I have no opinion on them as investments. The potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting, everything else is secondary.\n\nNews: [Trump's Trade War Puts Us Dollar Bonds Safe Haven Status At Risk](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2025-04-21/trump-s-trade-war-puts-us-dollar-bonds-safe-haven-status-at-risk)\n\n[**TSLA (Tesla)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TSLA&p=d) \\- Tesla is set to report Q1 2025 earnings today after market close. Analysts anticipate EPS of $0.41 and revenue of $21.54B, reflecting a 13% YoY decline in deliveries to \\~337K units. TSLA faces challenges from declining EV sales, brand damage, and potential impacts from new auto tariffs. I'm mainly interested in sub-$200 buys as a small reversal trade, not sure if I'll take a short position prior to earnings. Not interested in trading if the earnings are good. Risks include continued decline in deliveries, margin compression, and potential regulatory impacts from tariffs. Something else I'm interested in listening for is lessened political risk- if Elon is announcing an actual step down from DOGE then that might help the stock.\n\n[**SEDG (SolarEdge)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SEDG&p=d) / [**FSLR (First Solar)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=FSLR&p=d) \\- The U.S. has finalized tariffs up to 3,521% on solar imports from Southeast Asia, targeting countries like Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam. Most of our solar capability is imported from SE Asian countries. This move is meant to protect domestic manufacturers like SEDG and FSLR. Not too interested in this as a day trade, more as a swing trade.\n\n[**NOC (Northrop Grumman)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NOC&p=d) \\- Northrop Grumman reported a 49% drop in Q1 profit, with EPS of $3.32 vs. $6.32 YoY, due to a $477M charge related to the B-21 stealth bomber program. Revenue fell 7% YoY to $9.47B, missing expectations. Overall, many defense companies are losers from tariffs due to rising production costs and shifting geopolitical dynamics. Companies like NOC are under pressure to manage expenses while maintaining strategic programs which are essentially impossible due to tariffs. Risks include escalating costs in defense projects, potential delays in government contracts, and geopolitical uncertainties.\n\n[**JKS (JinkoSolar)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=JKS&p=d) \\- JinkoSolar, with U.S. manufacturing capabilities, stands to benefit from the new tariffs on Southeast Asian solar imports. Despite initial market reaction, the company's domestic presence positions it favorably in the current trade environment. FSLR and other domestic producers cannot manufacture the entire US's solar needs by themselves- JKS is likely to pick up the slack with their own manufacturing. But frankly, FSLR/ENPH/domestic producers are safer trades IMO.\n\nEarnings today: TSLA!",

This revelation contradicts Tesla's earlier assurances that all vehicles produced since 2016 had \"all the hardware necessary for full self-driving capability.\"\n\nIn January 2025, CEO Elon Musk acknowledged that HW3 lacks the necessary processing power for full autonomy. He stated that Tesla would need to upgrade the computers in vehicles of customers who purchased the FSD package. This admission has sparked discussions about potential compensation or hardware upgrades for affected owners.\n\nThe situation is further complicated by (HW4) computers. In early 2025, Tesla recalled over 200,000 vehicles due to HW4 units short-circuiting, leading to failures in safety features like rearview cameras. The company is addressing these problems through over-the-air software updates and, when necessary, hardware replacements.\n\nGiven the scale of the HW3 issue and the costs associated with potential retrofits or compensation, this could become one of the most expensive recalls in automotive history.

    "selftext": "Tesla's 50-day moving average is about to cross the 200-day, a bearish signal. Meanwhile, vehicle sales are slumping, while the valuation remains high.\n\nTesla Inc. investors need to ask themselves: How do you price in sentiment?\n\nChief Executive Elon Musk's involvement in Washington and his leadership role in the so-called Department of Governmental Efficiency, or DOGE, have been driving the narrative lately on Tesla's stock $(TSLA)$ - for better or worse.\n\nThe stock rallied in the final quarter of 2024, running up by 120% between late October and mid-December, partly on a strong sales outlook and partly because of Musk's closeness to President Donald Trump. Investors hoped his ties to the administration would be positive for Tesla.\n\nNow, though, those ties have become a liability for the electric-vehicle maker. People are vandalizing Tesla dealerships, charging stations and cars driven by its customers. Even those who aren't actively boycotting the brand may be deterred from owning a Tesla right now.\n\nThe company is heavily consumer-facing. About 77% of its revenue comes from consumer vehicles, and Tesla also sells energy products to consumers. So brand sentiment and its impact on sales matters. The truth is, very few high-profile brands have seen backlash and political boycotts to the degree Tesla is now experiencing.\n\nBud Light serves as one example, but to a lesser extent. Following an April 2023 boycott of Bud Light, Anheuser-Busch InBev SA's (BE:ABI) stock tumbled by about 16% in a little over a month. Sales for Bud Light haven't recovered. So gauging the fallout from backlash against Tesla ahead of its future earnings could be difficult.\n\nBob Lang, founder and chief strategist at Explosive Options, suggests turning to soft data to try and determine how consumers feel about the brand. A survey by YouGov from March showed that 37% of respondents said that Musk is either part of or wholly the reason they wouldn't consider owning or leasing a Tesla.\n\nWhat does the data tell us about Tesla's stock?\n\nIts technicals look rough\n\nIf you're a trader, you could probably resort to an endless number of indicators to gauge short term moves. But for longer-term investors, the 50-day and 200-day simple moving averages matter because they show long-term trends.\n\nAs of Friday morning, Tesla was near the \"death cross\", which is when the 50-day moving average falls below the 200-day moving average, a bearish signal.\n\n\"Why is that significant? It means that big institutional money is going to think twice about buying below this after the crossover is done,\" Lang said.\n\nBelow is a chart from FactSet that shows the near cross of the 50-day moving average to the 200-day moving average as of Friday's close. At current rates, the 50-day can cross over the 200-day on Monday.",

    "title": "Tesla Skyrockets Over 22% In A Single Day: Massive dual blast from the ERDF annihilates bears.",
    "selftext": "Well... It's time for a little self-deprecating humility and humor. \n\nPosition: I am short on Tesla (still). Yesterday sucked.\n\nIn two of my previous posts on r/stocks \"**Tesla Hidey Hole (Richmond, VA)- Don't believe the numbers tomorrow but the ERDF is real.**\" and **\"Forbes: \"Elon Musk's pet project- the dumpster driving Tesla Cybertruck...\" is one of biggest flops in automotive history.**\" I shared my ever growing conspiracy theory predicting the downfall of Tesla based on three things:\n\n1. The ERDF.\n2. Unscrupulous accounting that cloaks poor performance.\n3. And the downfall of Tesla will eventually be caused by the human element.\n\nHere is how it went down and what we can all learn:\n\nYesterday, after seeing the ego-fueled feud breaking out between Elon and Navarro (predictable), I desperately continued to search the deep, dark corners of the internet looking for anything to feed my confirmation bias in an attempt to make myself feel better about taking such a risky short position. Then it happened. Just what I was looking for. At **10:06am**, it is announced by Eletrek that Tesla's Director of Accounting Controllership, Harsh Rungta, is leaving the company:\n\nSource: [Tesla\u2019s top financial controller leaves (TSLA) ](https://electrek.co/2025/04/09/tesla-top-financial-controller-leaves-tsla/)\n\nI think: \"*This is it. It's finally happening!*\". All the pieces are fitting together. Not only is does this fit with my zany prediction (a key person leaving from the accounting side), Harsh Rungta is a former PwC guy (Tesla's independent accounting firm), so he probably has buddies inside that are telling him to jump ship before it sinks. I throw on my tinfoil hat, lick my lips, and wait for the stock to start dropping. \n\n**10:10am:** Sinister looking faceless people in black downhill bicycle racing helmets wearing gloves start pulling levers and pushing illuminated buttons. The bears don't know it yet- but we are doomed.\n\n**Soon thereafter- ERDF Blast #1 goes off:** My news feed starts getting hit with reports of Mizuho analyst Vijay Rakesh reiteraterating his \"outperform\" rating. A rating solely based on the same old tired and empty promises of the same old ripped-off concepts of future vaporware that will turn Tesla into \"not-a-car-company\" (some day), while lowering his massively inflated target price to something appearing slightly more sane to insane people. All the while, conveniently downplaying all the rising competition, trade war implications, and brand destruction happening in plain sight (per usual for these analysts). \n\n\\*Shit- not looking good now\\*\n\n**1:18pm:** A second massive blast from the ERDF is released by Trump on Truth Social, announcing a 90-pause in the tariffs. But not for China. They are getting hit with a 125% increase and escalation to escalate the trade-war. (But that doesn't matter. Even though it really does). \n\n**1:20pm:** The ERDF generates a massive disturbance in the Force (aka- the stock market). Millions of bears suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced. *Something terrible has happened.*\n\nWhat did we learn? Two important things:\n\n1. Headlines beat undercurrents every time. \n2. The ERDF has grown more powerful than anything anyone could have ever imagined. \n\nFor those that want to know: The \"Elon Reality Distortion Field\", or ERDF, is a real thing that I completely made up to make you laugh. \n\n**The ERDF- What it is and how works:** The EDRF is a headline generating and hype boosting force with unparalleled power. It can use it's force to pull in suckers from all over the world with a single blast and get them to dump money into Tesla stock. It can be used to elevate meme stocks and keep them going up regardless of reality. It is so powerful, that even smart people who understand it's power but don't believe in the company will invest in Tesla stock, knowing there is an endless supply of suckers (and maybe short sellers to squeeze). \n\nFirst, it was just Elon capturing the imaginations of people with his vision of a high tech, sporty, eco-friendly, EV with his theatrical stage shows (back when everyone thought he was cool). Then, it grew into something with the power of a Star Destroyer fleet after Elon made a massive (but deliberate) investment to acquire Twitter and change it to X. Now, X is a gargantuan social media platform of purchased/hijacked users which has been transformed into a massive Elon-only-world-view amplifier for the ERDF (i.e., it is highly censored to fit his narrative). Then it grew into a force as strong as a Death Star surrounded by a fleet of Star Destroyers when Elon and Trump pulled a Voltron and combined forces as POTUS and owners of two separate social media companies. Elon would like to use his ERDF to reshape the entire world in his own image now. And sadly, for us mortals, the force of the ERDF has indeed taken over the entire world.\n\n\\*Except Wisconsin. The odor of cheese is the only thing that can repel the ERDF and muskrats are terrified of badgers. Coincidence? I think not...\n\nI find the timing of analysts reiterating the same bullish ratings, news, fake news, and social media posts more than a little suspicious. We all know we are being jerked around but the magnitude of swings all this is causing is ridiculous. The markets were tested to see how they would react to a pause in tariffs with fake news, numbers were crunched, then it happened for real. \n\nBoth Trump and Elon openly grift on crypto and I see this as a continuation of a behavior pattern that has worked for them in the past, just using the stock markets. And they aren't even trying to hide their conflicts of interest anymore. Owning your own social media company, where you, as the POTUS, post news releases that create massive, record-breaking intraday swings in the global markets based on reckless, off-the-cuff decisions you are making on the fly, thereby boosting the number of users on your platform by offering an exclusive source of information that has massive and immediate impact on the largest and fastest flows of money in the entire history of the world, is just a slight conflict of interest don't you think? *\\*I used 7-commas in that run-on sentence.* \n\nThe thing I find most interesting, is many of the companies that shot waaaaay up (e.g., Tesla, Apple, Nvidia, etc.) should have been completely hammered with the announcement of tariff increases on China. All of these companies have manufacturing and supply chains that are heavily dependant on China and the trade war with them is only escalating. Tesla got a double boost yesterday during all the madness when it should have been a double whammy. As explained by one person that gets paid to write about such matters: \n\n\"*I say I\u2019m not sure why Tesla also surged on this news, but it\u2019s mainly because it\u2019s a meme stock now. It doesn\u2019t really trade on its actual earnings potential.*\n\n*Also, Tesla shareholders appear to be clueless about what\u2019s happening.*\"  \n\n(Source: [Tesla (TSLA) surges on Trump announcing bigger tariffs on China that will destroy its energy business](https://electrek.co/2025/04/09/tesla-tsla-surges-trump-bigger-tariffs-on-china-destroy-energy-business/))\n\nAs wiser Obi-Wan Kenobi-like Redditors have warned on my previous posts: \"Stay away from Tesla. It's a meme stock.\" They know and respect the power of the ERDF. And as Elon himself has said: \"*There is a large graveyard filled with my enemies. I do not wish to add to it, but will if given no choice.*\" He's not wrong when it comes to short sellers . Also remember: Porkins didn't survive the attack on the Death Star. This next wave of shorties probably won't either. But if fundamentals, actual product sales, brand destruction, and real numbers start mattering to Tesla, the ERDF might come down. That is our only hope. ",

    "title": "CMV: Trump's tariffs are political weapons intentionally designed to create leverage over nearly every country, industry, and company.",
    "selftext": "I've seen a lot of discussion here about why Trump is doing these tariffs. For example, I've seen:    \n\n1. He is doing this to bring manufacturing back to the U.S.A.  \n2. He is doing this to \"punish\" countries for their tariffs and trade imbalances on and with the U.S.A.   \n3. He doesn't know what he's doing, and is dumb and/or short-sighted.  \n  \nWhile I see where the logic for these explanations is coming from, I think there is a very real chance that the true explanation is that **Trump's tariffs are a political weapon, designed to give him leverage over nearly every country, industry, and company.** By instituting tariffs, rather than just threatening them, now the clock is ticking: countries, industries, and companies are frantically trying to figure out what to do.     \n  \nThink about it: first, Trump went after universities, threatening to withhold funding unless they caved to his demands about diversity and pro-Palestinian protestors. This has already forced major institutions, like Columbia, to bend the knee to him.  \n  \nThen, Trump went after big law firms and their clients, threatening through Executive Orders to cut off their access and intimidate them. This has already resulted in major law firms (Paul Weiss and Skadden) to forge \"settlements\" to do free pro bono work to the President's bidding, though luckily some of these firms (Perkins Coie) have had the integrity to fight back and sue.   \n  \nFollowing this logic, it follows that Trump with his tariffs doesn't legitimately believe what he is telling the public about his intentions. Far more likely, I think, that he is using these tariffs to force pledges of loyalty, concessions, and \"deals\" with countries, industries, and companies. \n\nThis is not my original idea, to be fair; I heard it from U.S. Senator Chris Murphy (D - Connecticut). He has pointed out that democratically-elected leaders turned despot/authoritarian/fascist will use tools like this to maintain power. Trump knows he cannot be reelected due to term limits, so how does he hold on to power? Like this. It is a slippery slope towards becoming a dictator. \n \nI can only hope that some countries/industries/companies see through this B.S. and fight back, but it is likely that many\u2014now that their finances are being hurt\u2014will bend the knee. \n\nGoing back to the common explanations for Trump's tariffs, here are my counterarguments:    \n\n1. If this was intended to bring manufacturing back to the U.S.A., that doesn't make a lot of sense. Companies aren't just going to upend decades of supply chains to invest billions into a country whose people don't want a lot of dirty, hard-work manufacturing jobs, especially when everything could (likely) revert back when Trump is out of office in 4 years.   \n2. I won't pretend to be an economist, but a big reason for the trade imbalances is because Americans like buying stuff from XYZ countries. That isn't those countries' fault, necessarily. And moreover, the chart Trump showed at the White House Rose Garden this week did not accurately reflect the actual tariff rates that foreign countries place on the U.S.A\u2014it included trade imbalances, which makes zero sense and is highly misleading, if not an outright lie.   \n3. Trump may appear dumb, but he has scores of well-planned sycophants from groups like the Heritage Foundation (Project 2025 authors) that are advising him. It is highly unlikely that they planned so much of his presidency, but the tariffs themselves were an afterthought.   \n  \nNow granted, we have heard rumors that the tariffs were hastily put together, and that Trump's team may have used ChatGPT to write some of the policy out. At first, this appears to support explanation no. 3. However, I think the hasty nature of these tariff policies actually supports the idea that they are purely intended as political weapons: it doesn't matter what exactly the tariffs are, what matters is creating immediate leverage.   \n  \nCurious for the community's thoughts. \n\nDisclosure: I have divested heavily from the U.S. markets and gone into EU stocks, especially defense. I am also short TSLA, DJT, and Air Canada.\n\n**EDIT:** As seeming proof of this theory, American journalist Kara Swisher [reported on BlueSky today](https://bsky.app/profile/karaswisher.bsky.social/post/3llynh6uoyk2z) that \"Several sources tell me a passel of high profile tech and also finance leaders is making a trip to Mar-a-Lago to read Trump the riot act \u2014 um talk common sense \u2014 to him on the tariffs. Their million dollar donations to the inauguration is turning into billions in losses.\"  \n  \nTranslation, I think: executives are bending over backwards to try and get concessions from Trump. This shows he has leverage over them already.",

The largest risk, according to analysts, centers on the iPhone maker's overseas production hubs, which are particularly vulnerable to the tariffed countries.\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump announced tariffs that will impact some 185 countries, including the United States's largest trading partners. Additional reciprocal tariffs, for instance, will include 34% tariffs on Chinese imports, a 20% tariff on European Union imports, a 46% tariff on imports from Vietnam, 32% on imports from Taiwan, and 26% on India \u2014 all set to take effect on April 9.\n\nNotably, the additional 34% tax on China will be added to the country's existing 20% tariff, meaning its total tariff rate will rise to 54%. China is Apple's most important\u00a0[production hub](https://www.businessinsider.com/tim-cook-apple-supply-chain-trump-tariffs-china-diversify-iphone-2025-1?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=yahoo.com), with about 85% of its iPhones manufactured there.\n\n\"Apple produces basically all their iPhones in China, and the question will be around exceptions and exemptions on this tariff policy if those companies are building more operations, factories, and plants in the US[\u00a0like Apple announced in February](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/02/apple-will-spend-more-than-500-billion-usd-in-the-us-over-the-next-four-years/),\" Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said in a note to clients following the announcement.\n\nAs trade tensions escalate, Apple has moved to increase its supply chain beyond just China, boosting manufacturing in places like India and Vietnam. But with the new tariff announcements set to impact those countries too, there's now limited room for reprieve.\n\n\"The worry will be around pricing and margin impacts along with what this means for the global supply chain looking forward,\" Ives said. For now, the analyst continues to believe major negotiations will happen over the coming months as companies attempt to navigate \"this new world of tariffs.\"\n\nUntil then, he warned, \"tech stocks will clearly be under major pressure.\"\n\nOther Magnificent Seven players also faced significant selling action. In aggregate, that cohort of stocks is currently on track to eliminate over $800 billion from their collective market caps.\n\nIn afternoon trade, Amazon ([AMZN](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMZN)) and Nvidia ([NVDA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NVDA)) each fell 7%, followed by a 6% drop in both Alphabet ([GOOGL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOGL)) and Tesla ([TSLA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA)). Meta ([META](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/META)) dipped 3%, while Microsoft ([MSFT](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MSFT)) was off just under 2%.\n\nOutside of the Mag Seven, chip stocks faced similar declines, despite the exemption of semiconductors from Trump's additional tariffs. Nvidia competitor Broadcom ([AVGO](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AVGO)), for example, erased well over $50 billion from its market cap following an 8% drop in shares.\n\n\"The implications \\[of the announced tariffs\\] are broad-reaching, and we see negative implications for the whole \\[chip\\] sector,\" KeyBanc analyst John Vinh wrote in a note to clients. \"These are most notably going to negatively impact end-demand in key markets including smartphones/iPhones and PCs, as a significant amount of manufacturing is done within China.\"\n\nStacy Rasgon, Bernstein's managing director and senior analyst, added in an interview with Yahoo Finance that the biggest headwind for semiconductors is not necessarily the direct impact of tariffs. Rather, it's the risk of demand destruction as these products become more expensive.\n\nHe added, \"The other risk for semis is that they are very cyclical, very global, and very correlated to the macro and to GDP.\u00a0[So if this tips us into recession,\u00a0](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/us-economy-dangerously-vulnerable-to-recession-wall-street-reacts-to-tariff-fallout-155837444.html)that's probably not going to be great.\"",

The decline in Tesla's China deliveries was a bit of a signal that the global sales would be bad, but frankly this wasn't as terrible as I expected. Currently short, will cover if we break $260 to the upside. Also interested in the $250 level. You guys know the risks by now (BYD and competitors, Musk, politics, etc).\n\n[**META**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=META&p=d), [**SNAP**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SNAP&p=d), [**GOOG**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=GOOG&p=d) \\- The April 5th deadline for TikTok to be sold off or face a ban is approaching, potentially leading to incremental headlines today in addition to tariff news. No real move in these stocks yet but I expect any news headline that is negative for TikTok to be great for the companies I'm watching (social media rivals). A ban on TikTok could alter the membership for the social media sites mentioned (they have to go somewhere). Since this is a weekend headline, I'm thinking of buying more GOOG- if TikTok DOES get banned, then these companies will likely gain. Otherwise, business continues as usual and they don't benefit. .",

    "selftext": "Tesla\u00a0reported 336,000 vehicle deliveries in the first quarter of 2025, two days after the electric vehicle company\u2019s stock wrapped up its worst quarter since 2022.\n\nHere are the key numbers:\n\n* Total deliveries Q1 2025: 336,000\n* Total production Q1 2025: 362,000\n\nInvestors were expecting Tesla to report deliveries of between 360,000 and 370,000 vehicles, according to StreetAccount. Tesla\u2019s investor relations team sends a company-compiled consensus to select analysts, and said the average estimate was for around 377,590 deliveries. Prediction market company Kalshi\u00a0on Tuesday released a forecast for Tesla deliveries of 352,000.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2024, Tesla reported 386,810 deliveries, and production of 433,371 vehicles.\n\nDeliveries are the closest approximation of vehicle sales reported by Tesla but are not precisely defined in the company\u2019s shareholder communications.\n\nTesla doesn\u2019t break out sales and production by model or region. However, the company said that it produced 345,454\u00a0of its most popular\u00a0Model 3 and Model Y cars\u00a0and delivered 323,800 of them in the three months ending March 31.\n\nThe company reported 12,881 deliveries of its other models, including its angular steel Cybertruck.\n\nDuring the quarter, Tesla faced planned, partial shutdowns in some of its factories that allowed the company to upgrade manufacturing lines to start producing a redesigned version of its popular Model Y SUV.\n\nCEO Elon Musk recently said during an\u00a0all-hands\u00a0session with Tesla employees that he expects the Model Y to be the \u201cbest-selling car on Earth again this year.\u201d\u00a0\n\nBut Tesla has to contend with an onslaught of EV competition and reputational damage. In the first quarter, the company was hit with waves of\u00a0protests, boycotts and some criminal activity that targeted Tesla vehicles and facilities in response to Musk\u2019s political rhetoric and his work as part of\u00a0President Donald Trump\u2019s\u00a0second administration.\n\nAfter spending $290 million to help return President Donald Trump to the White House, Musk is leading the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), where he\u2019s slashing costs, eliminating regulations and cutting tens of thousands of federal jobs.\n\nMusk, the world\u2019s wealthiest person, has also involved himself in European politics, promoting the anti-immigrant AfD party in Germany in February\u2019s elections. Tesla\u2019s business on the continent is struggling.\n\nAcross 15 European countries, Tesla\u2019s market share declined to 17.9% in the first quarter from 9.3% in the same period a year earlier, according to data tracked by EU-EVs.com. In Germany, Tesla\u2019s market share in battery electric vehicles plummeted to 4% from about 16% over that stretch.\n\nTesla shares\u00a0sank 36%\u00a0in the first quarter, their steepest drop since the fourth quarter of 2022 and third-biggest decline in the company 15 years on the public market. The drop wiped out $460 billion in market cap.\n\nSource: [Tesla (TSLA) Q1 2025 vehicle delivery and production numbers](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/02/tesla-tsla-q1-2025-vehicle-delivery-and-production-numbers.html)",

    "title": "Tesla Hidey Hole (Richmond, VA)- Don't believe the numbers tomorrow but the ERDF is real.",
    "selftext": "Before I jump into the stock related stuff, as an old, I feel it is important to preface this with a little cautionary advice. Here is my three points of \"don't be stupid\":\n\n1. I know Richmond has a storied history of burning shit going all the way back to the Civil War- but don't burn any Teslas. It's not worth it. And it's stupid. Furthermore, you are putting first responders at risk. You will also likely get caught. At least here in Virginia, there are [cameras everywhere](https://cardinalnews.org/2025/03/28/i-drove-300-miles-in-rural-virginia-then-asked-police-to-send-me-their-public-surveillance-footage-of-my-car-heres-what-i-learned/) and Tesla's themselves will record you. It's just not worth throwing your life away no matter how mad you might be. Before you get labeled a domestic terrorist and thrown in an El Salvadorian prison, read some Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn and get some perspective. He wrote from a Russian gulag after sharing his negative opinion of Stalin. We are currently on Reddit and nobody is going to jail for it.\n2. Don't harass individual Tesla owners. They didn't do anything to deserve it and most likely hate what is happening as well. I know some of them. It is unreasonable to ask them to dump their daily driver at a huge loss because Elon decided to make himself into a human lighting rod.\n3. I deliberately waited for the \"Tesla Takedown\" to be over before making this post so nobody would get any bright ideas. What you think is making a difference is likely to have the opposite effect from what you are hoping for. The people trying to stick it to Trump just got him more [support from billionaires](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckvvlv3lewxo) after he was convicted and if you didn't notice, $TSLA started deep in the red yesterday after the Tesla Takedown over the weekend and rallied way back and finished considerably up today. None of that moved the needle in any direction but up. Furthermore, if you burn or vandalize a Tesla, the insurance company will pay for it and just jack up all of our rates in turn. If any destroyed cars are still owned by Tesla, they will just use accounting methods to write it off. And that is one less car they don't have to sell at a time when they aren't selling many, which is the ultimate point of this post and makes a nice segue.\n\nIf you are mad about what Elon Musk is doing, or just want to make money on your $TSLA puts (like me- position disclosed), what sends a stronger message? A few burnt up Teslas or entire parking lots full of them because nobody wants to buy them? In my opinion, as well as [others with puts](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/story/nick-denton-interview-thiel-musk) on Tesla and think Elon has lost it, it is the latter. Speaking of which... I found one such parking lot!\n\nFirst, check out the few pictures I took of the local Tesla dealership here in Richmond (just outside the city). Their lot is clearly over capacity but nothing jaw dropping. There are a few dozen vehicles on the street and in a neighboring parking lot. After I shared these with a few friends, one of them told me that there were vehicle transporters unloading new Teslas near his work, which is a few miles away from the dealership and in an area of office buildings that have nothing to do with Tesla. I checked it out and there are a lot of them stuffed in the back of the lot. It's hard to see because I took the pictures at night and the cars are spread out but there are easily over 20 Cybertrucks and probably somewhere near 50 vehicles in total.\n\nNext door: [https://imgur.com/AxhLj6H](https://imgur.com/AxhLj6H)  \nOn the street: [https://imgur.com/krERZyr](https://imgur.com/krERZyr)  \nHidey Hole-1: [https://imgur.com/4MQsMlv](https://imgur.com/4MQsMlv)  \nHidey Hole-2: [https://imgur.com/d6xLmFk](https://imgur.com/d6xLmFk)  \nHidey Hole-3: [https://imgur.com/Ay3oTZh](https://imgur.com/Ay3oTZh)\n\nObviously, my local dealer isn't selling enough cars to keep up with their deliveries (no surprise to anyone). But the big question I have is: Are these vehicles considered \"delivered\"? Tomorrow Tesla reports how many vehicles they have \"delivered\" (not the same as sold). And if you haven't been paying attention as of late, Tesla has had some questionable practices going on in [Canada with their sales](https://fortune.com/2025/03/26/elon-musk-tesla-under-investigation-canada-wrongfully-boosting-sales/) and some possible questions raised about their accounting methods with the [$1.4 billion discrepancy](https://mashable.com/article/tesla-missing-billion-dollars) in their books. Going back a little further, there was a whistleblower that reported [Tesla deliberately messes](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/12/tesla-whistleblowers-filed-complaint-to-sec-in-2021-what-it-said.html) with their delivery numbers to make it appear as if they are selling more new cars than they really are.\n\nPoint being, no matter what is reported tomorrow, I am not going to believe the numbers Tesla provides. If there are new Teslas being shoved into an obscure parking lot in my city, it has to be happening elsewhere. At some point, I suspect the vehicle overflow will get noticed in other places too. Has anyone else found a Tesla hidey hole?\n\nMost importantly, even if the number suck tomorrow, I doubt it will make that much of a difference in the stock price because of the ERDF. What is the ERDF you ask? It is the \"Elon Reality Distortion Field\" (ERDF). And this incredibly powerful field effect is really all that matters when it comes to anything \"Elon\". It's real. And people should acknowledge it as such or risk their own peril. Nothing logical or sane applies to Elon Musk and it never has.\n\nEdit/Update: Despite missing on deliveries, $TSLA is not really down that much. Everything is being affected from the tariff news so any impact isn't really noticeable. And the sales miss is being explained away by the Model Y refresh, as widely expected and foretold by just about every media outlet covering Tesla. No surprises in the ERDF holding $TSLA strong despite the bad news.  \n\nIf any other business leader cobbled together their cars with parts from the [hardware store](https://futurism.com/the-byte/tesla-model-y-wooden-trim), cars that [kill more people than any other brand](https://www.roadandtrack.com/news/a62919131/tesla-has-highest-fatal-accident-rate-of-all-auto-brands-study/), launched the only new (and really ugly) car in forever that was [held together with glue that doesn't last outside](https://apnews.com/article/cybertruck-recall-tesla-elon-musk-nhtsa-8c517e21aa1119d74b9db39f6aca01b7) and needed to be fully recalled, had your main competitor (BYD) that makes key components for your cars [overtake you](https://www.forbes.com/sites/neilwinton/2024/01/03/byd-overtakes-tesla-with-other-chinese-ev-makers-close-behind/), had your own brother selling off [massive amounts of your stock](https://www.newsweek.com/elon-musks-brother-sells-27-million-worth-tesla-stock-2046659#:~:text=Elon%20Musk's%20brother%20Kimball%20Musk,of%20stock%20in%20the%20company), [smoked weed on the Joe Rogan Show](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/17/technology/elon-musk-spacex-national-security-reporting.html) and put huge government contracts at risk doing so, had reports of [massive drug use in the WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/business/elon-musk-illegal-drugs-e826a9e1), had reports of [worry about their mental well-being](https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2022-11-07/is-elon-musk-a-genius-or-an-idiot) coming out, became the [most indebted CEO in history](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/28/elon-musk-will-be-most-indebted-ceo-in-america-if-twitter-deal-closes.html), spread themselves out over six massive and diverse companies, then jumped into politics on [six continents](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/elon-musk/elon-musk-boosting-far-right-politics-globe-rcna189505) to promote views that fly in the face of their main customer base, spent a quarter-billion dollars in donations to get themselves installed as one of the most powerful unelected people in the US government while throwing out Nazi salutes, supporting [Hitler and Stalin on social media](https://www.forbes.com/sites/antoniopequenoiv/2025/03/13/musk-retweets-hitler-didnt-murder-millions-message-amid-ongoing-nazi-controversy/) while talking shit to [American allies and world leaders](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy87vg38dnpo), and was having their stores and products literally being set on fire all over the globe, they would be toast (\\*pun intended and this list of fuckery is not comprehensive). But not Elon. In fact, just the opposite occurred. He became, and remains to be, the richest man on Earth. This displays the tremendous power of the ERDF- It is nothing like the world has ever seen. Even more powerful than [Jewish Space Lasers](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/marjorie-taylor-greene-qanon-wildfires-space-laser-rothschild-execute.html).\n\nThe ERDF is by far and away Elon's greatest invention and achievement. If there are two things Elon should get tremendous credit for, it is knowing when to invest in the right things and building hype around them. The guy is a six-dimensional hype machine from outer space with uncanny prescience. From PayPal to SpaceX, he saw where future opportunity was being underinvested in and took it over. When it comes to Tesla, he even knew when to make it \"not a car company\". Using the power of the ERDF, he made it an AI, self-driving vehicle, taxi, and humanoid robot company just in the nick of time before sales of their actual product fell off a cliff. This company is now known as \"Tessler\". Now, it doesn't matter if they sell any cars at all. Elon is using the ERDF to sell the future and even control the presidency. And it's working. It sounds crazy as hell but we are all watching this happen in real life.\n\nAmazingly, the ERDF has allowed Elon to stall indefinitely on all promises of delivering the future and show absolutely no meaningful results for over a half-decade. Nor is Tesla a first mover in any of their new initiatives. Waymo (Google) has already launched self-driving taxis that are available using Uber and even in buzzing around in Austin Texas, where Tesla is headquartered. The idea of humanoid robots has been around forever. And one behemoth of a car company already developed one. But that happened over a quarter century ago. The car company was Honda and the robot was called ASIMO. And nobody cared. They discontinued it in 2018. Elon's \"Optimus\" has only been seen to do preprogrammed demos that look like Boston Dynamics routines from the early 2000's (nobody cares about them either). They have also been spotted shuffling around like Joe Biden. Neither the Robotaxi or Optimus robot are anywhere close to being released. And I have strong doubts as to what utility, if any, the Optimus robot will have for anybody. All of this seems to be a distraction created by the ERDF to draw attention away from the fact that Tesla still hasn't achieved \"full\" self-driving (and [ignored LIDAR sensors](https://cleantechnica.com/2025/03/17/lidar-vs-cameras-a-giant-fail-for-tesla/)). I am expecting Elon to come out with a \"Fred Flintstone\" sedan next, with no floor that you power with your feet, and telling everyone that it will be the future of travel. If Elon says it, then it \"Musk\" be true (the guy has a name that just keeps on giving).\n\nWith no first-mover advantage in the driverless taxi space, being behind tech giant Google there, and reviving an old failed sci-fi robot idea from their much larger and more established competitor in Honda, you would think Tesla would get graded down for unoriginality. But nope. The ERDF kicks in yet again and [most analysts are bullish](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/teslas-stock-dives-as-another-bullish-analyst-worries-about-deliveries-5e90f869) and astonishingly, Cathy Wood, seemingly most affected by the ERDF (and other things that make people stupid), thinks Tesla stock is going to reach an astounding [$2,600 in five short years](https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/cathie-wood-reaffirms-tesla-2-212612251.html)! That's about 10x more valuable than it is today, giving Tesla a market cap somewhere around $8.5 trillion dollars. That would make Tesla more valuable than all the other major auto manufacturers, Uber, Lyft, Google, Amazon, and Nvidia, combined in today's market (with a trillion to spare). Does that sound realistic? You can call me a skeptic of Cathy Wood...\n\nAgain, make no mistake, the ERDF is real. And if we are talking straight stock price, it matters. It might be the only thing that matters. Love him or hate him, it seems that Elon and his ERDF manufactured the most successful ad campaign in history right on the lawn of the White House. But it wasn't for the cars. It was for the stock. All the new people getting sucked into the ERDF because of Elon's new found bromance with Trump have no idea of what has been happening with Elon prior to his involvement in politics. And they don't care. They just know him as \"Tech Support\" guy and Trump's new ally. They love Trump and there is no shortage of them. They might be willing to wait another 5-years for Cathy's insane prediction to come true, not knowing everyone else had already been waiting for 5-years before them. Fresh meat so-to-speak. Tesla's 10-day average volume is over 138 million shares. And most of this is [retail traders going bonkers](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-21/tesla-s-retail-fanboys-buy-the-stock-at-a-pace-never-seen-before?embedded-checkout=true) for Tesla and Elon. It is likely that Elon has masterfully used his ERDF to transition retail stock holders from younger, tech savvy and/or environmentally conscious investors to straight up Fox News Dads in less than one quarter.\n\nWhile it has already been noted on this sub that institutional investors are likely pumping $TSLA to orchestrate a soft landing for themselves (on the backs of retail investors), I don't think they can exit too quickly without causing a complete fiasco. They only have to report 30-days after each quarter ends and they trade in dark pools. So, we plebeians won't know what the big institutional holders are doing until after they have done it (unless they report sooner). And if any one big institutional investor dumps their position fast enough to spook the market, there will certainly be consequences. Both political and financial. The finances between Elon, his many ventures, and his personal loans must be a complete nightmare of both complexity and scale. While in theory Elon could be \"margin called\" for his loans that have Tesla stock put up as collateral for, I am not so sure it would happen even if the stock drops significantly. The banks just went through a crisis of confidence with the whole Silicon Valley Bank collapse. If something triggered Elon's house of cards to collapse, it could have larger implications for his lenders and they might take a lot of heat for it. And the banks certainly don't want to invite in more oversight. They might just eat the loss and hold the shares in hopes they eventually regain their value. For that reason alone, I think the chances of Elon getting margin called are slim. But I would definitely be keeping an eye on the institutional holders once they report at the end of this month to see if there are any notable changes.\n\nEdit/Update: A few hours after posting this, it was reported that [Swedish firm Folksam](https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/sustainable-finance-reporting/swedish-insurer-folksam-divests-its-tesla-shareholding-2025-04-02/) closed their entire position in Tesla. While not nearly as big as other institutional holders, it was still about $160M worth of stock. That's not chump change. (Mods: Sorry for originally using a Seeking Alpha article in the link- I didn't know they were blacklisted). \n\nTo end this manifesto post, and give the shorts a little glimmer of hope, I offer one possibility that has not really been talked about all that much. Despite the massive power of the ERDF, some people do indeed escape it. And despite all the hype around AI, robots, and automation, Elon's companies are still run by the most unpredictable machines on the planet- humans. Tesla's long time CFO and potential successor for Elon, Zachary Kirkhorn, left suddenly in the [summer of 2023](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/tesla-cfo-zachary-kirkhorn-steps-down-replaced-by-vaibhav-taneja-2023-08-07/). Four more of Elon's top executives and direct reports left in [short order in 2024](https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-loses-4-top-executives-ahead-of-robotaxi-event-2024-10). Baglino sold off his [$180 million in shares](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/04/25/former-tesla-svp-drew-baglino-is-selling-181point5-million-worth-of-stock.html) when he left. Not much of a vote of confidence there. And Tesla as a whole recently [fired a massive number of employees](https://www.inc.com/jason-aten/tesla-started-laying-off-14000-employees-it-couldnt-have-gone-worse.html). From the reports, Elon seemingly did it in the same smug and indifferent manner in which he fired people at Twitter and is currently doing in the federal government.\n\nUltimately, if people become disenfranchised and are no longer willing to do Elon's bidding, his enterprises will fail. And there is only so much you can pay people to motivate them before you lose profitability. To make a Star Wars analogy, the only way I see to bring down the ERDF that protects and surrounds Elon's seemingly unstoppable Death Star, is if people on the inside of his operations lose faith in him and get tired of his bullshit. All the people around Elon: His loyal followers on X and even president Trump to some extent, don't do anything for him but build his ego and amplify the strength of the ERDF. But none of them know how to design and build cars or launch space shuttles. That's a very small group of very intelligent people that cannot be replaced as easily as retail investors. It's the smart people on the inside that make all of Elon's visions come into reality. In the end, I think the human element might be Elon's undoing.",

I am targeting potentially good candidates for short-term trading; I have no opinion on them as investments. The potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting, everything else is secondary.\n\nNews: [US Stock Futures Tumble Ahead Of New Trump Tariffs: Markets Wrap ](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-30/us-stock-futures-tumble-ahead-of-new-trump-tariffs-markets-wrap)\n\n[**SPY**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SPY&p=d)**,** [**QQQ** ](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=QQQ&p=d)**,** [**VXX** ](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=VXX&p=d)**,** [**USO**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=USO&p=d) , larger tech stocks - \"Liberation day\" (additional tariffs) is nearing, causing the market to selloff due to fears of escalating trade tensions and potential global growth impacts . We're pretty close to near lows from 3/13 (18 days ago, lol). \n\nOverall will be trying to buy a bounce for a day trade if we do end up breaking, but probably will be more focused on a VXX short rather than buying the market overall. I'm interested if we selloff or pop on the open, if we break new lows I may short/then flip long. This kind of headline-driven macro environment is a pain in the ass to keep track of, but creates a lot more opportunity for short-term trading. Risks that can change the tariff narrative or move the market include unexpected retaliation from trade partners, weakening consumer/investor confidence (like last week's numbers), and spillover into energy and commodity prices (Trump has signaled some action on oil, but we aren't sure what yet). \n\n**NVDA**[ **(Nvidia)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&p=d)\\- Another interesting thing that caught my eye this morning are reports from Chinese media that NVDA's new chip (GB300) are significantly delayed due to complexity and may be a quarter or two delayed (thus resulting in missed/delayed revenue). This could explain why NVDA is down significantly more (-3.5%) vs other semis. \n\n[**TSLA (Tesla)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TSLA&p=d) \\- Analysts have trimmed Q1 delivery estimates for TSLA amid weakening demand trends and delays in its Model Q vehicle (the cheap, Robotoaxi car). There have also been articles of divestment from pension/investing funds that are invested in TSLA that I've read, but whether those are serious, I'd hold judgement on. \n\nDelivery numbers are expected Wednesday and typically report premarket, so good to be cognizant of that. I'm interested in seeing if we can hold below $250 today. The EV sector in general has entered a consolidation phase, with cost competition and flagging consumer incentives weighing on demand, and BYD is hot on TSLA's heels and likely going to overtake TSLA within the year. Below-consensus deliveries could spark a guidance reset for earnings, margin compression of their other cars due to the Model Q, and market share loss in China and Europe are key concerns. Also random people torching Tesla dealerships.\n\n[**PLTR (Palantir Technologies Inc.)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=PLTR&p=d) \\- No material news catalyst, but PLTR has experienced five consecutive red sessions and is likely moving with the overall stock rout. Worth noting that PLTR cut close to 60% of its IT Team (said by CTO in recent interview), and DoD cut close to $600M in spending (which affects PLTR). Also worth noting that we are EXACTLY right back to where we started before we had significant retail interest in this stock ($80). The broader AI/data analytics sector has seen a pullback after a multi-month run and has been somewhat outpaced rational valuation so not too interested in this for the long term. ",

    "selftext": "As we have all seen, there are a ton of headlines about Tesla's (TSLA) declining sales numbers, and it's honestly a bit overwhelming. Here's a quick breakdown of what I gathered:\n\n* Europe sales are reportedly down by 45%\n* China sales have decreased by either 49% or 29%\n* Australia sales are down by 65.5%\n\n\\^\\^ keep in mind there are a ton of articles and headlines on this, I picked from a few \\^\\^\n\nWith all these headlines, it's tough to figure out what timeframes they're talking about. Is it one day, one week, three months? Who knows?\n\nAmidst all this noise, I decided to dig deeper into what we should actually expect. While analysts' projections aren't great, they don't seem as grim as the headlines suggest.\n\n**Global Tesla Sales (Q1):**\n\n* **2024 Actual**: 386,810 units\n* **2025 Initial Projections**: 412,000 units (median of 398K-426K range, which would've been a 6.5% increase)\n* **2025 Current Projections**: 377,000 units (a 2.5% decrease from Q1 2024)\n* **Projection Change**: Initial to current projections dropped by 8.5%\n\n**USA Sales Breakdown (Q1):**\n\n* **2024 Actual**: 140,187 vehicles\n* **2025 Current Projection**: 138,867 vehicles\n* **Change**: Only a 0.9% decrease in the US market\n\nThese numbers don't look great, especially for a company like Tesla that's all about growth. But we're still talking about single-digit declines quarter-over-quarter, assuming the analysts are somewhat correct.\n\nI wanted to understand what the Q1 report might reveal because, going by the headlines, it seemed like it would be terrible. But after digging in, it doesn't seem as bad as it feels. Is it just me?\n\nWhat do you all think? Could the market react less harshly on Q1 review day than the news is making it out to be?",

This confirms prior speculation tied to Ryan Cohen\u2019s meeting with Strategy\u2019s chairman.\u00a0**This is a massive catalyst**\u00a0solely based on the fact that if GME buys enough of the CC, we may see it trade at a premium the same way as MSTR does. (MSTR usually trades at a 2x valuation to the amount of CC it holds.). Volatility in the CC market could create swings in reported earnings, but makes GME easier to track price-wise. The core retail business still saw a 28% Y/Y decline in sales which is somewhat of a red flag. Biased positive.\n\n**Related Tickers:**\u00a0MSTR, COIN\n\n[**TSLA (Tesla)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TSLA&p=d)\\- Second day of straight gains, with shares up 3.5% after a close to 50% selloff. I'm Interested in $290 level after failing to break above it in the premarket. EV sentiment remains mixed for TSLA going forward- despite weakness in European sales, investor sentiment appears to be shifting positive. Sales in Europe fell 40% Y/Y, and Canada\u2019s EV rebate freeze adds regulatory actions into the mix. BYD is also close to overtaking TSLA, so I still don't consider this investible for the long-term (but it is tradable).\n\n[**DLTR (Dollar Tree)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=DLTR&p=d)**-**\u00a0DLTR will divest its Family Dollar segment for \\~$1B to Brigade Capital and Macellum, a massive markdown from the $9B it paid in 2015. The stock reacted fairly positively on this news, mainly because DLTR has been struggling since COVID. This move is an effort to clean up the balance sheet and refocus on the core business. The market probably views this favorably in the face of tariffs - less potential exposure to Family Dollar inevitably underperforming.\n\n**Related Tickers:**\u00a0DG\n\n[**NVDA (NVIDIA)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&p=d)\\- New energy rules in China disqualify NVDA's exportable H20 chip, threatening near-term revenue from a key market.

China\u2019s energy mandates are squeezing data center hardware providers, forcing chipmakers to adapt or lose access to the market. Having the H20 not be usable is a huge blow to NVDA's revenue, as it makes up close to 10% of their revenue in 2024. More regulation or bans could further limit access to Chinese demand, other chipmakers, etc. This DOES seem targeted to have Chinese companies focus on\n\n**Related Tickers:**\u00a0AMD, INTC, QCOM",

Stocks had kicked off the week with big gains following news that President Trump could scale back some of the tariffs that are due to be imposed next week on U.S. trading partners. With the recent gains, the Dow has inched back into positive territory for 2025, as stocks have rebounded from a month-long selloff spurred by concerns about the potential impact of tariffs and uncertainty about the outlook for the economy.\n\nInvestors brushed off consumer confidence data released this morning that came in weaker than expected, with the index hitting its lowest level in more than four years. Investors are closing watching all data points amid worries that tariffs could reignite inflation and cause economic growth to stall. The big economic report of the week comes Friday with the scheduled release of the Federal Reserve's preferred measure of inflation.\n\nThe yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which had fallen during the recent stock market rout amid the growing concerns about the economy, was at 4.32% in late trading, down from 4.33% at yesterday's close and from an earlier high Tuesday of 4.37%. The yield, which affects costs on all sorts of loans, notably mortgages, hit its highest level in more than a month this morning.\n\nMega-cap technology stocks, which helped lead Monday's rally, were mostly higher again today.

This might actually be reacting a little positively due to BYD's blowout earnings. BYD reported $107B annual revenue for the year and are close to TSLA's profit! Mainly concerned in the long run about margin compression due to pricing cuts, increased competition in the EV space, macro headwinds, and of course, Elon making fork sculptures in the White House but no one appreciating them. \n\n[**MSTR (MicroStrategy)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=MSTR&p=d)\\- MicroStrategy buys 6,911 more of the underlying, now holds over 506k, currently at 2x premium. Nothing too interesting to note beyond the typical upwards move from whenever MSTR announces a buy of the underlying. We've bounced slightly off the lows, but worth noting that the underlying is also rose from news that Trump might use his gold holdings to buy more. I always keep in mind MSTR's heavy dependence on underlying performance, regulatory scrutiny, and volatility, of course. Related tickers to watch on this are RIOT and COIN/HOOD.\n\n[**LUNR (Intuitive Machines)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=LUNR&p=d)\\- Reported strong Q4 and FY24 results. Q4 revenue of $54.7M (+80% YoY) and FY24 revenue of $228.0M (nearly 3x YoY).\n\nBacklog reached $328.3M (+22% YoY), with **projected positive run-rate Adj. EBITDA by year-end**. Overall backlog seemed to be the second most important factor, signifies that there is future revenue and they are far more financially stable than anticipated and even profitable by year end! I have a very small position long. Going to bail if we break below $7 but overall I think there are many tailwinds that can help LUNR. **L**UNR's main risks are execution risk tied to lunar missions (beginning of this month saw the stock fall close to 50% in a single day), contract delays, reliance on government funding, and high R&D intensity with limited margin buffer/no defined return.

    "title": "Tariffs, DOGE and Columbia \u2014 The market will crash because Trumpism is not capitalism",
    "selftext": "There is a lot of talk, in this subreddit and just about everywhere, about how the tariffs are going to affect stock prices. I think the bigger factor is that Trumpism is not capitalism. This government has asserted its right to cancel contracts and grants, and the right to use all means at its disposal to impose policy on non-government entities. One example: NIH grants have been canceled because they were interpreted (apparently by someone who probably did not even read them, and certainly doesn\u2019t understand them) as being no longer in line with the priorities of this government. These are multimillion dollar projects on topics like cancer, autism and shingles. They were funded after a careful competitive review by scientists, and they were stopped after much of the money was spent. It\u2019s half-finished bridges. You can no doubt provide many examples yourself. If you can\u2019t, ask in the comments. My point here is that under Trumpism the government will abandon contracts at will, and will use the threat of cancellation to micromanage state and local government, and corporations.\u00a0\n\nThe cases of Columbia and Maine illustrate that this government has replaced the rule of law with rule by one man. In both cases, Trump asserted the right to dictate policy normally left to the University (regarding the limits of free speech on campus) or to the state (regarding trans-gender athletes), and found ways to enforce that. I don\u2019t yet know of a case where this government directly managed a company, but I\u2019m sure it will come; he has the tools (the threat of cancellation of government contracts, or exemptions from tariffs, to name two). The threat of arbitrary and capricious directives from this government, coupled with the inability to rely on contracts being honored, is going to destroy profits. Milton Friedman, the famed Chicago school economist, argued that democracy, economic freedom and the rule of law are essential for prosperity. We no longer have those things. Let me give you three examples.\u00a0\n\nI have significant holdings in MRNA, Moderna. Their mRNA technology allows the rapid development of custom drugs, not only vaccines, but drugs to treat cancer and many other diseases. They demonstrated that they can deliver during the covid-19 pandemic, and many estimates hold that RNA vaccines saved over 10 million lives. This is a great American company, and it should be ascendent, but its stock price is currently beaten down by the reasonable expectation of politically based resistance to mRNA vaccines from the Trump administration.\u00a0\n\nTSLA was one of last year\u2019s magnificent seven and rose even higher when Trump was elected because of the expectation that the CEO Elon Musk\u2019s close personal relationship with the president would pay off. Now, it has fallen along with Musk\u2019s popularity. People realize that DOGE found precious little waste and fraud but compromised many valued functions of government. To my point here, the value of TSLA stock is entirely dependent on Trump\u2019s continued favor. If there are many government contracts, it will probably recover. If there is a falling out after Trump finally finds it necessary to blame Musk for the obvious problems with DOGE, then it will not. In either case, this is not a free market.\u00a0\n\nFinally, I want to mention Boeing. Trump personally announced on Friday that Boeing had been selected to build the F-47 jet fighter, a contract potentially worth $50 billion. So far so good, but he\u2019s making it clear that he decides. I expect this contract to specify everything from who Boeing can purchase parts from, to DEI policies, to whether someone given the name Charles at birth can go by Chuck.\u00a0\n\nTrumpism is government regulation on steroids.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0",

So nothing would be at a loss. I just feel we are facing a man made intentional potential crash of US stocks. Could be short term or long term. One issue, I\u2019m also near retirement age so I don\u2019t have 20 years to wait for a correction. \nLet me further say all my eggs are not in one basket. I\u2019m fully diversified with only 1/3 of my liquid assets in stock. Because of my age 2/3 is in very safe such as CD\u2019s near 5%. Also 2 houses paid off, nice car paid off, zero debt on credit cards paid off monthly. \nBut I can\u2019t make a misstep. My portfolio will be 1/2 of the income I will rely on for income in a few years. \n\n\nI know we are not supposed to make rash decisions based on \u201cfeelings\u201d but it\u2019s more than that, I\u2019m reading nonstop everything about this market and as an older person I feel like I\u2019m seeing a potential 2008 all over again. I wisely went cash then. And in 2010 bought my house for only  42% of it was valued in 2006. Now it\u2019s worth 5 times what I paid for it. \n\nSo anyone who has weathered a few markets, what\u2019s your take? Is cashing out Apple,Amazon,NVDA for instance a crazy move right now? ",

    "selftext": "Short sellers have been cleaning up to start 2025 amid a massive sell-off in some of the market's most popular names over the past two years.\n\nShort sellers have made a combined $15 billion betting against Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA) stock thus far this year, according to data from S3 Partners. Tesla shorts alone have raked in nearly $11 billion, while bets against Nvidia have brought in more than $4 billion.\n\nTesla's 40% year-to-date drop has led the declines of the so-called Magnificent Seven stocks. Investors have grown concerned about CEO Elon Musk's focus on government efficiency efforts and how his role with President Trump's administration could be a turnoff to the electric vehicle maker's customer base.\n\nBut it hasn't just been Tesla lagging. As an index, the Magnificent Seven \u2014 which also includes Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), and Meta (META) \u2014 is underperforming the S&P 500 this quarter by the most since 2022.\n\nShort sellers have profited off of all of the names in the cohort this year. They've brought in nearly $5 billion betting against Apple stock, which is down nearly 14% in 2025.\n\nThe crash in the most popular trade of the past two years comes as investors have been re-rating their growth expectations. Fears of slowing economic growth and the impact of Trump's tariff policies have weighed on markets. Meanwhile, Big Tech has faced growing investor criticism about its ballooning AI spend and whether or not it will eventually boost future profits as much as Wall Street hopes. The year also included a massive drawdown in some large tech names, including Nvidia, following the release of a cheaper AI model from Chinese company DeepSeek.\n\nNow, with most of the names sitting around 20% off their recent 52-week highs, the looming question for markets is whether or not investor appetite for the stocks that led the market higher for the past two years will return.\n\n\"Maybe these tech stocks got ahead of their skis a little bit,\" BMO Capital Markets chief investment strategist Brian Belski told Yahoo Finance last week. \"But at the end of the day, these are monster companies that define the growth trajectory for the United States stock market.

    "selftext": "SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Motorists have traded in a record number of Tesla (TSLA) electric vehicles this month, Edmunds data showed, amid a wave of protests against CEO Elon Musk's work as an adviser to U.S. President Donald Trump.\n\nTesla cars from model year 2017 or newer accounted for 1.4% of all the vehicles traded in until March 15, up from 0.4% in March last year, according to data provided to Reuters by Edmunds. Analysts at the national car shopping website said that share could grow through the second half of the month.\n\nIn February, the Trump administration's first full month, Teslas made up 1.2% of vehicles traded in.\n\nMarch's trade-ins so far would be the highest monthly share Edmunds has on record of Tesla trade-ins toward new or used purchases at dealerships, if the trend continues. This excludes trade-ins toward new purchases of Teslas and EVs from other direct-to-consumer brands.\n\nMusk is leading the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency and activists across the U.S. have staged so-called Tesla Takedown demonstrations over his role in cuts to the federal workforce and cancellation of contracts that fund global humanitarian programs.\n\nSocial media has been rife with posts from Tesla owners in the U.S. and some European countries showing them giving up their vehicles in displays of anger toward Musk.\n\nThe March data on Tesla trade-ins has not been previously reported.\n\n\"Brand loyalty is becoming a bigger question mark as factors such as Elon Musk's increasing public involvement in government, Tesla depreciation concerns and its increased saturation in major metro areas leave some longtime owners feeling disconnected from the brand,\" said Jessica Caldwell, Edmunds' head of insights.\n\nSpokespersons for Tesla and Musk did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nTesla has said it expects the vehicle business to return to growth this year, after a small drop in 2024.\n\nPrices of used Teslas have dropped in line with other EVs from Ford, Kia and Hyundai, according to Edmunds.\n\nUsed Tesla prices will likely decline further as Tesla trade-ins that are undergoing reconditioning reach the market, Edmunds analysts said.\n\nAnger against the brand has resulted in Tesla vehicles being set on fire and damage to the company's showrooms and charging stations.\n\nTrump has said he would label such attacks as domestic terrorism.\n\nTesla stock, which skyrocketed since Trump's election in November on hopes it would be easier for the company to roll out robotaxis under the new administration, has nearly halved from its January peak.\n\nFred McKinney, a corporate consultant, traded in his 2018 Tesla Model 3 last month to show his disapproval of Musk.\n\n\"I thought about putting a bumper sticker on my car saying, 'I hate Musk.' But selling the car feels so much better,\" he said on a LinkedIn post. \"If you are considering a new EV, under no circumstances consider buying a Tesla.\"\n\nData from Edmunds also showed shoppers' consideration of new Teslas dropped to 1.8% last month - the lowest level since October 2022 - after peaking at 3.3% in November.\n\nTesla's sales likely fell 10% in February, hurt by declines in its Cybertruck pickup, Model 3 sedan, and Model Y SUV, separate estimates from market research firm Cox Automotive showed on Thursday.\n\n\"These shifts in Tesla consumer sentiment could create an opportunity for legacy automakers and EV startups to gain ground,\" Caldwell said.\n\n\"As Tesla brand loyalty and interest waver, those offering competitive pricing, new technology, or simply less controversy could capture defecting Tesla owners and first-time EV buyers.\"\n\n[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/exclusive-tesla-trade-ins-pace-221635339.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/exclusive-tesla-trade-ins-pace-221635339.html)",

Tariffs on China, Canada, Mexico, and the EU are back on the table, with zero indication that he\u2019s backing down. While some sectors (steel, domestic manufacturing) stand to benefit, others (tech, autos, multinational retailers) are getting crushed. The question is: at what point does the market pain force Trump to change course?\n\nThe **2025 Trade Policy Agenda** lays out his vision:\n\n\u2705 **Tariffs as leverage** \u2013 forcing trade partners into more \u201creciprocal\u201d deals\n\n\u2705 **USMCA review (2026)** \u2013 questioning whether Canada & Mexico are benefiting unfairly\n\n\u2705 **Hardline stance on China** \u2013 blaming it for the U.S. trade deficit and pushing for stricter enforcement of trade agreements\n\nHis strategy? **Drive U.S. production up, cut reliance on imports, and force foreign partners to play by his rules.** But markets are worried about **inflation, supply chain disruption, and retaliatory tariffs**\u2014all of which are starting to bite.\n\nNot every company is hurting\u2014some stand to **benefit significantly** from Trump\u2019s protectionist approach. Trump\u2019s tariffs **shield domestic manufacturers from foreign competition**, making U.S. steel, aluminum, and energy companies prime beneficiaries. E.g \n\n* **U.S. Steel** X 25% steel tariffs will boost profits\n* **Cleveland-Cliffs** CLF Increased demand for domestic steel\n* **Nucor** NUE Largest U.S. steel producer, stronger pricing power\n* **Anheuser-Busch** BUD Domestic production = insulated from trade costs\n* **Prologis** PLD Companies stockpiling goods = warehouse demand surge\n* **Lockheed Martin** LMT Defense spending likely to rise under Trump\n* **Marathon Petroleum** MPC Energy independence push favors domestic refiners\n\nCompanies with **complex supply chains** and reliance on **overseas production** are getting squeezed by **higher input costs and potential retaliatory tariffs**.E.g\n\n* **Apple** AAPL Major China exposure, supply chain at risk\n* **Tesla** TSLA Higher costs across supply chain, could hurt margins\n* **General Motors** GM Tariffs on parts increase manufacturing costs\n* **Ford** F Supply chain disruptions could impact production\n* **Nike** NKE Manufacturing in China = higher import costs\n* **Amazon** AMZN Increased cost of goods from global suppliers\n* **Boeing** BA Risk of Chinese retaliation cutting aircraft orders \n\nAre you positioning for a **domestic manufacturing boom**, or do you think **this trade war will spiral into a full-blown recession**? Should we be **buying the dip** in industrials or **shorting overexposed multinationals**?\n\n  \nTrump\u2019s strategy is clear: use **tariffs as a multipurpose weapon**, not just for trade but also for **immigration and national security**. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick hinted that **Canada & Mexico could avoid tariffs if they \u201cimprove border security\u201d and crack down on fentanyl trafficking**. This suggests Trump is **negotiating in multiple arenas at once**, using economic pressure to force compliance on broader policy goals.\n\nThe problem? **Markets hate uncertainty**, and businesses can\u2019t plan if policy keeps shifting based on unrelated factors. While some U.S. industries benefit, long-term uncertainty could hurt investment, expansion, and consumer confidence.",

    "selftext": "SAN FRANCISCO, March 18 (Reuters) - Tesla\u00a0[(TSLA.O),](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/TSLA.O)\u00a0on Tuesday received the first in a series of approvals from California required for the electric car maker to eventually launch a promised robotaxi service in the state, according to a state regulator.The California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) said it approved Tesla's application for a\u00a0[transportation charter-party carrier permit](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/tesla-seeking-approval-offer-ride-hailing-services-california-bloomberg-news-2025-02-27/)\u00a0(TCP), a license typically associated with chauffeur-operated services, allowing the company to own and control a fleet of vehicles and transport employees on pre-arranged trips.\n\nThe permit is a prerequisite for applying to operate an autonomous ride-hailing service in California, but a CPUC spokesperson said the current permit \"does not authorize them to provide rides\" in autonomous vehicles, and does not allow Tesla to operate a ride-hailing service to the public.With sales growth slowing, Tesla CEO\u00a0[Elon Musk](https://www.reuters.com/business/elon-musk/)\u00a0pivoted his focus last year to rolling out robotaxis and has promised driverless ride-hailing services to the public in California and Texas this year. In October, Tesla revealed the\u00a0[Cybercab](https://www.reuters.com/technology/teslas-musk-unveil-robotaxis-amid-fanfare-skepticism-2024-10-10/), a robotaxi concept that had no steering wheel or control pedals.Tesla had applied for the TCP permit in November 2024, the regulator said in an email, adding that the company had not applied for the other permits yet.Tesla would also need permits from the California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) and CPUC in order to operate a fully autonomous robotaxi service that charges customers.Tesla currently only has a DMV permit to test autonomous vehicles with a safety driver.A DMV spokesperson said on Tuesday that Tesla has not applied for any additional permits from the agency, which would be required to move forward with a CPUC application for driverless taxis.Tesla did not respond to requests for comments on the permit and details on the other applications.\n\n[https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/tesla-gets-first-series-permits-it-needs-run-robotaxis-california-2025-03-18/](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/tesla-gets-first-series-permits-it-needs-run-robotaxis-california-2025-03-18/)",

(A la 2019)\n\n\ud83d\udccc Will domestic manufacturing gains **outweigh** supply chain disruptions?\n\nI\u2019d love to hear counterpoints.

    "selftext": "Snippet from this article:\u201dAfter a slight rebound earlier this week, Tesla's TSLA stock is back to falling, keeping with its recent performance. Even U.S. President Donald Trump's purchase of one hasn\u2019t done much to spark real momentum for the electric vehicle (EV) leader.\nAfter enjoying significant growth throughout the final months of 2024 and through early 2025, TSLA\u00a0has lost its previous momentum and isn\u2019t showing signs of a rebound. As reports of declining sales and shifting consumer sentiment continue to trend, it's hard to ignore the company\u2019s questionable outlook.\n\nLink: https://www.thestreet.com/technology/tesla-stock-declines-could-cost-elon-musk-something-important\n\nMany of these problems can be traced to CEO Elon Musk, who is preoccupied with his new responsibilities at the Department of Government Efficiency. His absence at Tesla\u2019s manufacturing facilities is being felt as share prices continue to trend downward.\nMusk has lost a lot of money as TSLA stock falls, but he could end up losing something else.\n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk may be in for a difficult decision if TSLA stock keeps declining.\u00a0\n\nMusk\u2019s intertwined business empire could be in trouble \nTesla may be the company for which Musk is best known, but his assets include several other prominent tech names, including SpaceX and X (formerly Twitter). This wide array of responsibilities concerned investors long before he accepted his new position at DOGE.\nNow that he has this new position, Musk is spending even less time running his companies, and things haven\u2019t been going well for any of them. While Tesla stock fell last week, a SpaceX rocket exploded during a test flight, and a cyberattack took X down, although users regained access fairly quickly.\n\nTesla Bull sounds the alarm on Elon Musk\u2019s leadership\n\nThis week, reports surfaced that TSLA stock\u2019s poor performance has resulted in significant losses for Musk. On Monday, March 10, he lost roughly $4.7 billion for every $10 the stock price declined, amounting to a total loss of $18.8 billion.\n",

It had the largest move and got down to around $212. Overall a lot of negative sentiment ranging from boycotts and Elon controversies. Not too interested in trading TSLA today again.  I'm interested in NVDA if we break below 100 but again I think that we'll mainly see a small bounce today rather than breaking new lows. As for RDDT, we're 50% down from highs! Interesting swing candidate but will see how today goes. To me these are the standout stocks yesterday to trade due to recession fears. I don't really see a way out for TSLA regarding the boycotts. We've also seen a decently large move in the VIX (VXX) and we're close to above 60- I'm interested in shorting if we're above $60 but doubt we'll hit that today.\n\n[**ASAN (Asana)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=ASAN&p=d)\n\nCEO/co-founder, Dustin Moskovitz announced retirement. The company reported Q4 revenues of $188.3M, a 10% YoY increase, and issued a revenue outlook for fiscal 2026 below expectations (resulting in the drop).\n\nThat drop was close to 25%, mainly because Dustin owns close to 54% of the company, which signals a LOT of uncertainty and lack of faith in the company. Overall outlook is decently disappointing, and I'm mainly interested in it if we break $11.50 and very interested in buying $10.\n\n**Ticker:** [**AAL (American Airlines)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AAL&p=d)\n\nAAL projected a higher-than-expected Q1 loss and revised its revenue outlook downward, attributing the weaker forecast to softness in the domestic leisure segment. This is probably amplified by fears of flying, mainly due to people being terrified of all the plane accidents that have happened in 2025. Recession fears also lead to people cutting their vacations/discretionary spending and saving money, so things may get worse. Overall we're seeing a slight recovery in the premarket but still watching to see how this trades. To me airlines are one of the bigger leading signals of economic uncertainty so will continue watching. Other tickers that have moved on this are DAL, UAL, LUV.",

    "selftext": "When it comes to recent major market corrections, the largest drops have coincided with the loosening of interest rates. There have been market corrections outside of these periods, however, those events are significantly lesser in scope compared to the current analog situations of 2000, 2008, and 2020. \n\nThe Fed Funds rate was held at 6.5% from June 2000 to December 2000. It was 5.25 from July of 2006 to July of 2007. It was 2.4 between January of 2019 and July of 2019. \n\nAs the Fed began cutting rates, in each situation, the market began to decline. However, it was during these declines that illiquidity events took place, causing major panic, and subsequent cratering of markets. \n\nThe 1-point decline in interest rates from peak coincides with February 2001, December 2007, and November of 2019. Each respective recession officially began in March of 2001, December of 2007, and February 2020. \n\nWe hit 1-point below peak in January. There is a strong possibility we are ALREADY in recession, however, genius economists will only tell us this in a year or two. \n\nIn any case, each of these recessions coincided with feat contagion and general panic. Each of these events also bottomed after major catastrophes - in 2000 it was 9/11 and Enron, in 2008 it was Lehman + subprime crisis, in 2019 it was.... that horrible thing that we no longer talk about. \n\nWe are already in the fear stage of the market. 2000's panic was a general meltdown PRIOR to the crises that later unfolded. However, it was those crises that marked its bottom. 2008 and 2020's craterings occurred simultaneous to their crises although stocks did drift down prior to 2008 as well. \n\nThis begs the question: what is the crisis that may or may not occur with the cyclical correction that happens as the Fed cuts rates EVERY cycle? Will it be a true black swan no-one saw coming (9/11) or will it be something like Enron, Lehman, or COVID, where some DID see what was coming ahead of the general panic?\n\nCould TSLA be the Enron of the 2025 bust? It is seeming more and more plausible with each passing day. In any case, the bottom of the market in each of the aforementioned cases occurred simultaneous to the Fed funds rate hitting 0 (or almost 0 in 2003). I expect shelter contribution to CPI to vanish in the next few reports + unemployment to rise significantly, this could give the Fed leeway to put rates back to 0 as soon as Q3-Q4 2025. In both 2009 and 2020 the Fed rate hit 0 when annualized CPI did the same (in March), and March of both years also coincided with their respective market bottoms. \n\nTLDR; we are far from the bottom, which should occur when Fed Funds hit 0, buy when that happens but before that point, gird your loins.",

Secretary Lutnick announced yesterday \"Tariffs compromise announcement will likely come tomorrow\", so will be on the lookout for that.\n\nNews: [Trump Hails Tariffs as US Economy Barrels Into Trade Wars](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-05/trump-to-tout-tariffs-unveil-energy-mineral-projects-in-speech)\n\n**Ticker:** [**NVDA (NVIDIA)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&p=d)**,** [**AMD (Advanced Micro Devices)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AMD&p=d)**,** [**SMH (Semiconductor ETF)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SMH&p=d)**,** [**SOXL (3x Semiconductor ETF)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SOXL&p=d)\n\n**Catalyst:** Trump has called for an end to the CHIPS Act Subsidy Program (instead preferring tariffs).\n\n**Technicals:** Short biased. Obviously this takes away a lot of investment in semis companies. Extremely negative catalyst but unlikely it will get repealed due to how much bipartisan support it had.\n\n**Catalyst/Sector Context:** The CHIPS and Science Act gave $280B in new funding to boost domestic research/manufacturing of semis in the US, and also aimed to strengthen supply chain resilience against China and widely considered to be a success because it spurred the development/dominance in the semis sector in America.\n\n**Risks:** If this gets repealed, we're likely going to see a pretty large pullback in the semis. Obviously this is dependent on what the tariffs Trump touts will do as well. [I wrote a little more about my take on a different post](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1j437g9/trump_calls_for_end_to_52_billion_chips_act/) but overall more of the same (I think it's a terrible idea).\n\n**Ticker:** [**GM (General Motors)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=GM&p=d)**,** [**F (Ford Motor Company)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=F&p=d)**,** [**TSLA (Tesla)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TSLA&p=d)\n\n**Catalyst:** The Trump administration is considering granting relief from the recently imposed 25% tariffs on Canadian and Mexican imports for products that comply with the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA).\n\n**Technicals:** We've seen all three stocks (GM especially) make gains due to this announcement, will watch at open for volume.\n\n**Catalyst/Sector Context:** The automotive industry in US/Canada/Mexico involves the most economic/manufacturing cooperation in the USMCA, they're the most obvious beneficiaries of this potential catalyst.\n\n**Risks:** If they don't actually give relief, then will likely pullback- cars are one of the most affected products of tariffs and pretty much every car company has spoken about tariffs on their earnings calls.\n\n**Ticker:** [**IBIT (IBIT)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=IBIT&p=d)**,** [**COIN (Coinbase)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=COIN&p=d)**,** [**HOOD (Robinhood Markets)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=HOOD&p=d)\n\n**Catalyst:** Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has indicated that Trump plans to grant the main biggest CC a \"unique status\" within the Bitcoin reserve strategy, which will be unveiled at the White House Crypto Summit on Friday.\n\n**Technicals:** We've seen the underlying spike close to 8-9% since yesterday, watching $90K level. Interested to see how we go prior to the actual summit.\n\n**Catalyst/Sector Context:** Obviously an extremely bullish catalyst, we've bounced strongly off the $80K level recently. I usually trade through the ETFs as needed, and HOOD/Coinbase serve as proxies in case the ETFs aren't liquid or have already moved.\n\n**Risks:** Worth waiting for the catalyst and watching the CC Summit on Friday. I personally see this more of a \"buy on hype\" kind of catalyst, unless there's an announcement of something extremely bullish I'm not sure how much more this will move the needle.\n\n**Ticker:** [**HII (Huntington Ingalls Industries)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=HII&p=d)\n\n**Catalyst:** Trump has announced initiatives aimed at strengthening the U.S. shipbuilding industry to counter China's dominance, spoke about the creation of a White House Office of Shipbuilding and the introduction of special tax incentives.\n\n**Technicals:** None that I'm particularly interested in, this is a longer-term play.\n\n**Catalyst/Sector Context:** China produces over half of the world's merchant vessels, this is more of a play to reduce reliance on foreign-shipping.\n\n**Risks:** There's a chance that this will never happen, Trump tried to create a \"Cybersecurity Department\" in his first term but that was never formally created and we kept those duties spread out between the FBI/DHS/NSA. But we also have the Space Force so... stay tuned.\n\n**Earnings:** [**MRVL**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=MRVL&p=d), [**VEEV**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=VEEV&p=d), [**ZS**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=ZS&p=d), [**MDB**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=MDB&p=d)",

TSLA has been on a slide since post-election highs and frankly shows no real sign of recovery. Looking for a small bounce in this stock but I don't think there is much potential for long-term recovery.\n\n**Catalyst/Sector Context:** TSLA's EV sales have been declining in China mainly due to BYD, which are considered to make better cars for far cheaper outside the US. The US has a 100% EV tariff for non-US made EV vehicles.\n\n**Risks:** BYD has been eating TSLA's lunch outside of the US. I truly don't see TSLA retaining dominance as the EV of choice outside the US. \n\n**Ticker:** [**OKTA (Okta)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=OKTA&p=d)\n\n**Catalyst:** Okta beat earnings expectations with EPS of $.78 vs $.74,gave guidance that supports EPS of $3.20 vs $2.93. (Also note that CRWD reports today but are not direct competitors)\n\n**Technicals:** Watching $100 level.\n\n**Catalyst/Sector Context:** Cybersecurity (more specifically IAM) grows yearly mainly due to RPO and cRPO (remaining performance obligations). This is subscription backlog expected to be recognized over the next 12 months.\n\n**Risks:** Market saturation/pricing concerns from competitors.\n\n**Ticker:** [**NVDA (Nvidia)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&p=d)\n\n**Catalyst:** Nvidia is front and center as the stock most affected by tariff concerns.\n\n**Technicals:** Watching $110 level. Note that this is the lowest it's been since September 2024. We have millions of shares come in in the first 2 minutes of the open so watch for that.\n\n**Catalyst/Sector Context:** Not much to speak of that hasn't been said before, but NVDA is heavily affected by tariffs and the CHIPS Act, with additional scrutiny that it is somehow bypassing export controls and having their chips go into China.\n\n**Risks:** MORE trade disputes, more potential export restrictions, (Trump has cited he wants to strengthen export controls for NVDA).\n\n**Ticker:** [**BABA (Alibaba)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=BABA&p=d) / [FXI (iShares China Large-Cap ETF)](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=FXI&p=d) / Other Chinese Stocks\n\n**Catalyst:** China has imposed 15% retaliatory tariffs on select U.S. goods.\n\n**Technicals:** $130 level. Most interesting level I'm watching today.\n\n**Catalyst/Sector Context:** Tariffs, stimulus from the Chinese government, China has been spending for increased consumer confidence. \n\n**Risks:** Even greater tariffs, the cash cannon that China is using dies down, less spending by Chinese consumers, etc.\n\n**Related Tickers:** CRM, ZS",

Interestingly enough, ByBit was (theorized) to be hacked by North Korea.\n\n**Related Tickers:** MARA, RIOT\n\n**Ticker:** [**BABA (Alibaba)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=BABA&p=d)**/**[**FXI (iShares China Large-Cap ETF)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=FXI&p=d)**/Chinese Stocks**\n\n**Catalyst:** China plans to inject at least $55 billion into its largest banks in the coming months as part of a broader stimulus package, Yuan printer go brrrrr. This move is intended to supplement the core Tier 1 capital of China\u2019s six largest state-owned banks. This is the first bank recapitalization since the global financial crisis. 10T yuan (\\~$1.4T) debt package to support local government financing and economic stability.\n\n**Technicals:** We've seen a decent upmove on a lot of Chinese stocks due to this, we'll see how the market reacts.\n\n**Catalyst/Sector Context:** China has been going through a spending crisis, and the government's decision to inject substantial capital into its major banks is a move to strengthen liquidity. This initiative aims to enhance the lending capacity of banks, support local government financing, and stabilize the broader economy. It's a (pre) bailout baby.\n\n**Risks:** This does signal that China sees economic weakness, such as lack of demand due to their real estate sector they've traditionally leaned on for consumer growth/investment. Is this a long term fix? Who knows, but it worked for the US!\n\n**Related Tickers:** JD, BIDU\n\n**Ticker: SMCI**\n\n**Catalyst:** They finally filed an hour before the deadline on the final day! Really cutting it close there lol. The company has faced\u00a0allegations of accounting irregularities. These allegations, along with a failure to file specific financial forms have been a plague for the past year on the stock price. \n\n**Technicals:** We've seen a 20% move AH, so worth watching at open to see if we move further. Other than that, watching $50/$55 level. We'll see where it goes but worth noting that we've made a significant move back to pre-delisting threat prices already.\n\n**Catalyst/Sector Context:** Was at threat of delisting from the NASDAQ but now they're safe baby.\n\n**Risks:** People getting out, or the filing being rejected/advised to resubmit. The latter is a massive catalyst but low probability.\n\nEarnings: NVDA, CRM, SNOW, AI",

What's a good buy if I'm very negative on the current direction of the US?\n\nMoving money from the US to foreign markets may be smart, but which? And a crash in the US tends to affect the entire world, so while they'd probably be safer, they won't be safe.\n\nI pulled out of the US markets entirely last week before the 4 down days. I just put 1/3 of my portfolio into EUAD which is an ETF of some of the biggest European defense stocks.  I know I'm a few months late on this one. Europe is realizing that it can't count on the US anymore and will have to grow its own defense industry. I'm definitely willing to investigate and invest in smaller defense stocks too. I don't expect it to go nuts, because these are old established companies and their stocks don't move that fast, but I think it's a very safe bet that Europe's defense stocks are going to grow over the next few years.\n\nWhat are some other examples of trying to adjust to the current situation? Short TSLA? Invest in other EV companies that take some of the post-TSLA hype? What industries/ETFs represent the best bet for the trade the US loses if it starts implementing tariffs again?

    "selftext": "When I say that phrase I hear it in the movie computer voice.  Anyway, I vaguely remember the stock market crash of 1987.  I was young but I used to play a stock trading game on my \u201cIBM Compatible\u201d computer which really wasn\u2019t but that is how they sold you computers back then.  It had a ticker that would scroll across the screen and you could buy and sell stocks in made up companies.\n\nNo one really knows where the stock market is heading the rest of the year but I could make a pretty good argument we are moving towards stagflation temporarily.  I can see a scenario of a weakening economy with persistent inflation.  So, if the market were to move negative the rest of the year, what are your picks to see the largest downside moves?\n\nMy picks:\n\nTSLA - Obvious reasons\u2026its stock prices is built on a dream that is becoming a nightmare\nPINS - Low revenue growth outside the U.S, ADU growth slowing down, It is mostly ads now and almost unusable. 25B market came to 3.5B revenue.\nSNAP - 11 years in and still can\u2019t make a profit.  \n\nAlso, if federal grant money really does decline, and cuts to Medicaid, pick any public health care stock and buy puts.  If they cancel infrastructure contracts, pick most of the shovel companies like Caterpillar and buy puts.  If they cancel the farmer subsidies, buy puts in John Deere.  So many others that are going to be hurt.\n\nSo what is your pick for the largest declining stock of 2025 between 2/25 and 12/31?  ",

Feeling a lot better/safer with that decision, but would love some thoughts. I know TSLA is pretty hated on Reddit, but I do believe in their FSD and roadmap for the next few years. Moving forward, my contributions are going to be primarily towards building that Vanguard ETFs fund.",

    "selftext": "\n\nI\u2019m no Tesla expert, and I\u2019m sure plenty of people know way more about the company than I do, but I wanted to throw out some thoughts and see what you all think.\n\n\n\nRight now, TSLA is sitting around $330 a share, up 75% YOY. But honestly, I see some major red flags:\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udcc9 Shrinking Profit Margins \u2013 Tesla\u2019s margins have been steadily declining for years. Not a great trend.\n\n\n\n\ud83c\udff4\u200d\u2620\ufe0f Musk\u2019s PR Nightmare \u2013 Elon literally gave a \u201cSieg Heil\u201d on live TV. Now, a huge chunk of the world sees him (and by extension, Tesla) as a Nazi. That\u2019s\u2026 not exactly great for brand reputation.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\ude97 Cybertruck is a Mess \u2013 Poor build quality, tons of issues, and at this point, it\u2019s basically a meme.\n\n\n\n\ud83c\udf0d New Political & Tariff Risks \u2013 Tesla is vulnerable to steel and aluminum tariffs, an anti-EV U.S. President, and a California governor who hates Musk and might pull state EV rebates.\n\n\n\n\u26a1 Serious Competition is Catching Up \u2013 Tesla isn\u2019t the undisputed EV/FSD leader anymore. Other companies are matching\u2014or surpassing\u2014them in innovation.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udea6 FSD is Overhyped \u2013 Despite all the robotaxi talk, Tesla\u2019s self-driving tech is still only Level 2-3. Meanwhile, other companies already have Level 4 robotaxis on the road.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udd0b Rising Costs = Profit Squeeze \u2013 Raw material costs are going up, and Trump\u2019s tariffs on China-made batteries could make things even worse.\n\n\n\n\ud83e\udd16 Tesla is Struggling to Attract Top AI Talent \u2013 Even before Musk\u2019s latest antics, nearly all top AI researchers and recent ML PhD graduates from the top schools were choosing OpenAI, Anthropic, or GAMMA (Google, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, Apple) over Tesla or xAI. Now? Even fewer want to work there, which could hurt Tesla\u2019s AI progress.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udd35 Losing Left-Leaning Consumers \u2013 Left-leaning buyers are way more likely to buy EVs than right-leaning ones. And almost every left-leaning consumer has grown to despise Musk, leading them to choose non-Tesla EVs instead.\n\n\n\nTesla used to be the Nvidia of EVs\u2014they were miles ahead of everyone else. But that\u2019s just not the case anymore. There are more non-Tesla EV options every year, and in terms of FSD, several companies already have a better product and better talent. So, to me, a $1.1 trillion valuation feels ridiculous.\n\n\n\nWhat do you guys think? Am I being too bearish, or is Tesla in for some rough times ahead?",

    "selftext": "Edit:  thanks for replies.  I think I understand better now, the concept of \"decay\" (due to volatility, rebalancing etc) and how an inverse ETF can go down even when the stock it's tracking also goes down.\n\nNew question:  let's say I'm willing to make a \"bet\" that TSLA goes down in the next 6-12mo... what is the simplest way for me to make that bet?  Do I really have to get into margin accts and short selling?  Basically I'd like to \"mirror\" TSLA for next 12mo.  Is there a simple way to do that or not really?\n\n\\---\n\nI'm new to inverse ETFs and have a small position in TSLQ.  I do know that several 'warnings' say that these style investments are meant for intraday, but since it is an ETF I don't understand the risk of holding for weeks or months.  (apart from the obvious, if the tracking stock goes up)  So here's my question, if the hypothesis comes true (that TSLA goes down over next 6mo) what is the risk to just hold TSLQ ETF for that period?\n\nAnother way to ask, is there something else going on with the 'tracking' where over longer periods of time the ETF won't track to certain kinds of losses (eg; during after hours or something else...)?  Is it possible that TSLA goes down over a period of time but somehow TSLQ doesn't gain?\n\nSorry if this is remedial or breaks any rules please let me know... I'm genuinely confused after reading different things about inverse ETF risks.",

Announces that profit could fall by $2B or more due to tariffs and lower EV demand.\n\n**Technicals:** Pretty much broke the $10 level it's been trading around since August, watching to see if it'll sell off more by the open. Highly/infinitely liquid.\n\n**Catalyst/Sector Context:** The entire automotive industry is challenged by tariffs. F guided lower for 2025.\n\n**Risks:** Obviously these are one of the bigger movers from Mexico tariffs (most cars are assembled in Mexico then shipped to the US).\n\n**Related Tickers:** GM, TSLA, STLA.\n\n**Offhand Comments:** Ford's outlook reflects the broader industry's apprehension about geopolitical factors affecting operations and profitability. Interesting to see how other car companies react to earnings as well.\n\n**Ticker:** [**ARM (Arm Holdings)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=ARM&p=d)\n\n**Catalyst:** ARM reported EPS of $0.39 vs. $0.34 expected. Revenue of $983 million vs. $959M expected. Buoyed by Deepseek ban news, most likely as well.\n\n**Technicals:** Was down roughly 8% after earnings, but seems to be somewhat recovering after Deepseek news.\n\n**Catalyst/Sector Context:** Semiconductor sector is experiencing heightened demand, especially after PLTR's comments that the AI train will never stop. We're seeing growth in data center applications, the main driver of semis purchases.\n\n**Risks:** Despite strong performance, Arm's lowered full-year revenue forecast has led to a 6% drop in its shares.\n\n**Related Tickers:** NVDA, AMD, INTC.\n\n**Ticker:** [**RBLX (Roblox Corporation)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=RBLX&p=d)\n\n**Catalyst:** Roblox Corporation reported earnings with an EPS of -$0.33 vs. -$0.46 expected. Revenue of $988.2M vs. $967.2M expected.\n\n**Technicals:** $50 is the clear level here, note that earnings were released premarket rather than aftermarket yesterday. Seems to be a massive overreaction selloff (but has recovered somewhat).\n\n**Risks:** IIRC Roblox isn't profitable yet- they're focusing on growth/revenue over profits, but most of their costs are outside their control (platform fees like the Apple store, developers, infrastructure for trust/safety for minors).\n\n**Related Tickers:** EA, TTWO.\n\n**Ticker:** [**NVDA (NVIDIA Corporation)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&p=d)\n\n**Catalyst:** DeepSeek, a Chinese AI start-up, has temporarily suspended its API service top-ups due to server resource constraints. Additionally, U.S. lawmakers plan to introduce a bill to ban DeepSeek's chatbot application from government-owned devices over data security concerns.\n\n**Catalyst/Sector Context:** The AI industry is under increased scrutiny regarding data security and geopolitical tensions but that's grown more laissez-faire under Trump. DeepSeek's service suspension and potential U.S. government ban helps American chip makers and NVDA especially, due to their continued dominance.\n\n**Risks:** Deepseek getting banned will likely lead to greater reliance on American AI chatbots, spurring growth in American semis manufacturers.\n\n**Related Tickers:** AMD, INTC, QCOM.\n\n**Offhand Comments:** (I am currently long).\n\n**Ticker:** [**SWKS (Skyworks Solutions)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SWKS&p=d)\n\n**Catalyst:** EPS of $1.60 vs. $1.57 expected. Revenue of $1.07B vs 1.07B expected. Reports $2B stock buyback plan.\n\n**Technicals:** Watching the $60 level, we've had a brutal fall from $90->$60. If we get closer I'm interested in some small bounce depending on volume/size of the move.\n\n**Catalyst/Sector Context:** SWKS supplies some of the chips for Apple's iPhone, and their iPhone sales haven't done too well recently- thus this has a knock-on effect by affecting SWKS's sales.\n\n**Risks:** SWKS projected a revenue decline for the mobile segment and issued a lower profit forecast. They stated they anticipated a \"mid-to-high teens decline in mobile.\"\n\n**Offhand Comments: A lot of the firms that manufacture parts for the iPhone are linked in performance, especially if the iPhone is the main source of their sales- would be interesting to formulate some trading ideas from that.**\n\n**Related Tickers:** QCOM, AVGO, TXN.\n\n**Earnings today:** [**AMZN**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AMZN&p=d).",

    "selftext": "I did a quick and dirty DCF valuation for TSLA, and here\u2019s what I found. I don\u2019t own TSLA individually; I only have exposure through the S&P. However, with recent events, I\u2019ve been wondering why people hold TSLA.\n\nMy typical process when looking into a company starts with a DCF to gauge approximately what the company should currently be valued at. I know, I know, it\u2019s not perfect, but it\u2019s a way to get started.\n\nFor TSLA, I averaged the last three years of free cash flow (FCF) at about $5.1 billion. I used a 5% FCF growth rate and a terminal growth rate of 3%, along with a discount rate of 12%. All these estimates are generous for a few reasons: the share count is increasing, FCF has declined over the past three years, and the risk is high.\n\nWith these assumptions, I came up with a value of $26.24, which is only 6.85% of the current price. This means that 93% of the value is based on future growth and speculation.\n\nNow, many people assume that Tesla will revolutionize humanoid robots and self-driving cars, so I took a more optimistic approach to the DCF. I used a 20% FCF growth rate and a terminal growth of 7%, which is probably unrealistic. Using the same discount rate, I arrived at a value of $52.62. This represents 13.74% of the current value, meaning 86.26% is based on even more future growth and potential.\n\nWith all that said, it\u2019s hard for me to understand what people see in this company. Or am I just thinking the wrong way, and it has nothing to do with making money?\n\nCongrats to all the long-term holders who have made a killing! I\u2019d love to hear your thoughts on this.",

We might also see some volatility tomorrow at the open, VIX has already spiked but went back to preannouncement levels.\n\n~~EDIT: TARIFFS ARE DELAYED UNTIL MARCH 1ST~~\n\n# [EDIT 2: ANNOUNCEMENT OF TARIFF DELAY HAS BEEN DEBUNKED, STILL CONTINUING ON SATURDAY ACCORDING TO WH PRESS SECRETARY ](https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/north-america-braces-new-trump-tariffs-saturday-deadline-nears-2025-01-31/)\n\n>President\u00a0Donald Trump\u00a0President\u00a0Donald Trump\u00a0said he would follow through on his threat to impose 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico on Feb. 1, citing the flow of fentanyl and large trade deficits as among the reasons for his decision.\n\n>\u201cWe\u2019ll be announcing the tariffs on Canada and Mexico for a number of reasons,\u201d Trump told reporters Thursday in the Oval Office as he signed executive actions in response to a deadly airplane collision.\n\n>\u201cNumber one is the people that have poured into our country so horribly and so much. Number two are the drugs, fentanyl and everything else that have come into the country. Number three are the massive subsidies that we\u2019re giving to Canada and to Mexico in the form of deficits,\u201d he said.\n\n>West Texas Intermediate oil futures climbed above $73 a barrel following the comments. The US dollar wiped out an earlier loss to touch the day\u2019s high after the remarks, while the Canadian dollar and Mexican peso both plunged. US Treasuries pared their gains.\n\n>Trump indicated the 25% rate could represent a floor, saying that the tariff levels \u201cmay or may not rise with time.\u201d\n\n>But the US president did suggest he was still considering if one significant import \u2014 oil \u2014 would be exempted. Trump said would be making a determination as soon as Thursday evening, basing his decision upon the price of oil.\n\n>\u201cWe don\u2019t need the products that they have. We have all the oil that you need. We have all the trees you need,\u201d Trump added, referring to major imports from Canada.\n\n>Trump\u2019s move was closely anticipated by markets as well as global business and political leaders who have scrutinized his words and actions for any indication on whether the US president would deliver on his levy threats or use them as the starting point for negotiations on trade.\n\n>Trump in recent days threatened and then pulled back on tariffs against Colombia in a dispute over deportations of undocumented migrants, leading some to speculate that he was using trade levies merely as leverage to seek policy concessions.\n\n>Trump also indicated that he would proceed with tariffs on China. He didn\u2019t specify the levy, though he\u2019s previously said it would be 10%. Trump has said Beijing failed to follow through on promises to prevent fentanyl and the chemicals used to make the deadly drugs from flowing into the US.\n\n>\u201cWith China, I\u2019m also thinking about something because they\u2019re sending fentanyl into our country, and because of that, they\u2019re causing us hundreds of thousands of deaths,\u201d Trump said Thursday. \u201cSo China is going to end up paying a tariff also for that, and we\u2019re in the process of doing that.\u201d\n\n>Trump has ordered his administration to investigate whether China complied with a trade deal struck during his first term, setting the stage for tariffs against the world\u2019s second largest economy.\n\n>Following through on tariffs against Canada and Mexico, who are US neighbors, major trading partners, and export markets, threatens to have dramatic economic consequences, rattle markets and potentially launch a trade war by undermining protections from a three-nation free trade agreement.\n\n>Both countries have pledged to respond to any trade levies, including with retaliatory tariffs, even as their leaders sought to assure the US they were addressing border concerns in a bid to defuse the conflict.\n\n>\u201cIf these tariffs go into effect, Canada will respond,\u201d Canadian Ambassador to the US\u00a0Kirsten Hillman\u00a0said Thursday. \u201cThis is not something that we want to do. We do not want to get into a tariff-back-and-forth with the United States. It\u2019s not good for Canada, Canadians and Canadian workers and it\u2019s not good for the United States, Americans and American workers.\u201d\n\n>Hillman said that Canada has responded to Trump\u2019s concerns about the border by clamping down and announcing new security measures, including added drones and helicopters.\n\n>Canadian Prime Minister\u00a0Justin Trudeau\u00a0visited Trump at his Mar-a-Lago resort even before the president was inaugurated in a bid to ease tensions between their nations, and Mexican President\u00a0Claudia Sheinbaum\u00a0spoke to Trump to try to avert the levies.\n\n>In the first 11 months of 2024, US trade with Canada totaled $699 billion and $776 billion with Mexico. And the magnitude of tariffs Trump will enact could have stark impacts on particular industries, such as the auto industry and the energy sector. Shares of US automakers\u00a0Ford Motor Co.\u00a0and\u00a0General Motors Co.\u00a0turned negative on the announcement, erasing earlier gains.\n\n>\u201cPresident Trump\u2019s tariffs will tax America first,\u201d Matthew Holmes, executive vice president at the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, said Thursday. \u201cFrom higher costs at the pumps, grocery stores and online checkout, tariffs cascade through the economy and end up hurting consumers and businesses on both sides of the border. This is a lose-lose.\u201d\n\n>Trump is also promising sectoral tariffs, such as on pharmaceuticals, semiconductor chips, steel, aluminum and copper, which could apply widely to many countries, including Canada and Mexico.\n\n>The US president is an avowed believer in tariffs, saying they will force a renaissance in domestic manufacturing, though industry groups warn that it will upend supply chains and endanger existing factories by raising costs of source materials.\n\n>He\u2019s hailed tariffs as a source of revenue as lawmakers move to renew and expand expiring tax cuts and approve other credits and benefits the president promised on the campaign trail. Trump wants to reduce the corporate rate to 15% for firms that manufacture goods in the US, compared to the current 21% rate.said he would follow through on his threat to impose 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico on Feb. 1, citing the flow of fentanyl and large trade deficits as among the reasons for his decision.\n\n>\u201cWe\u2019ll be announcing the tariffs on Canada and Mexico for a number of reasons,\u201d Trump told reporters Thursday in the Oval Office as he signed executive actions in response to a deadly airplane collision.\n\n>\u201cNumber one is the people that have poured into our country so horribly and so much. Number two are the drugs, fentanyl and everything else that have come into the country. Number three are the massive subsidies that we\u2019re giving to Canada and to Mexico in the form of deficits,\u201d he said.\n\n>West Texas Intermediate oil futures climbed above $73 a barrel following the comments. The US dollar wiped out an earlier loss to touch the day\u2019s high after the remarks, while the Canadian dollar and Mexican peso both plunged. US Treasuries pared their gains.\n\nLink: [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-30/trump-says-he-ll-hit-canada-mexico-with-25-tariffs-on-saturday](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-30/trump-says-he-ll-hit-canada-mexico-with-25-tariffs-on-saturday)",

    "selftext": "This is a daily watchlist for short-term trading: I might trade all/none of the stocks listed, and even stocks not listed!\n\nI am targeting potentially good candidates for short-term trading; I have no opinion on them as investments.\n\nThe potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting, everything else is secondary.\n\n**Today OpenAI may make history. Trying out longer form, more detailed catalyst examinations over the short-form with more tickers.**\n\n**Ticker:** [**META (Meta Inc)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=META&p=d)\n\n**Catalyst:** Reported earnings of $8.02 vs $6.68 expected. Revenue of $48.4B vs $47B,but guided revenue short of consensus and didn't provide FY25 revenue outlook (which triggered the reason for the selloff post-earnings after the close).\n\nTheir CAPEX announcement was $60-65B vs $52.4B expected, and stated they expected the single largest driver of expesive growth in 2025 as infrastructure costs due to higher OpEX and depreciation.\n\nAlso announced plans to grow META's AI team significantly.\n\n**Volume/Market Cap/Technicals:** Earnings move the stock on far less volume but the initial selloff after announcement was worth trading- interested in the $700 level today but not much beyond that.\n\n**Context:** Decent earnings but signals that there is more spending on the horizon- likely that the initial brutal selloff to $606 was from algos just reading the initial eye-popping CAPEX number and selling the company.\n\n**Sector Context:**There is a major next-level breakthrough that OpenAI is expected to release today that has agents performing on the same level as PHDs, Altman is meeting today with US government officials. META is the creator of Llama, which is another open source model compared to OpenAI's closed models.\n\n**Risks:** Deepseek has been the main threat involved, with competitors from China using distillation and other AI techniques to be able to train a far cheaper model that brings up the question of why our large tech firms are spending so much on GPUs. (I'm sure this is news to you /s)\n\n**Related Tickers:** FAANG stocks, SNAP, PINS, etc.\n\nOffhand:  Something worth remembering is that there is a $10B undersea cable that spans over 40K km that they plan to build (unknown what the cable is for), more details coming in 2025. Likely some kind of fiber optic cable.\n\n**Ticker:** [**TSLA (Tesla Inc.)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TSLA&p=d)\n\n**Catalyst:** Reported earnings of $0.73 vs $0.76 expected. Revenue of $25.71B vs $27.23B expected. Most of this revenue miss came from miss in sale of EVs. \n\nTSLA announced interesting plans to lower the price of EVs in 2025 but also didn't give specific details regarding the production volume targets (as they have in the past), and also announced that there would be a paid robotaxi service in Austin in June. This puts them in competition with Waymo/UBER. Personally I think the vision-only approach is not viable in the long-run but hey, I'm no self-driving PHD. \n\nCAPEX was ALSO higher as with META due to spending increases from AI training infra costs and battery production capacity.\n\n**Volume/Market Cap/Technicals:** I'm mainly interested in the $375/$400 level, not too interested in going long despite the multi-day slide in price.\n\n**Context:** Main reason for TSLA's selloff was the lack of full-year guidance (it gives the subtext that it's too bad to release publically or it's up in the air). Political statements made by Musk may contribute to future issues for TSLA.\n\n**Sector Context:** Revenue shortfall was caused due to lower-than-expected vehicle deliveries/ increased sale incentives, 496K cars vs 507K exp. China's BYD is rapidly catching up, and the (possible) removal of the US EV tax credit may make EV's more expensive\n\n**Risks:** Mainly geopolitical- if the tariffs on EV vehicles imported to the US gets removed, TSLA will face fiercer competition from BYD. Also Elon Musk.\n\n**Related Tickers:** BYD (but mainly trades in China, TSLA isn't as impacted by AI news.)\n\n\n\n[**NVDA (NVIDIA Corporation) (in addition to ARM/AMD/SMH/SOXL/semiconductor stocks)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&p=d)\n\n**Catalyst:** The reveal of Deepseek has introduced an AI model that rivals existing solutions but was developed at around $6M. However there's a rumor that Deepseek is actually trained on 50K H100 NVDA gpus.\n\n**Yesterday after the close, there was an announcement Trump officials discussing tightening curbs on Nvidia's China sales.**\n\n**Volume/Market Cap/Technicals:** Overall, there's been a massive selloff since NVDA was $150 at the end of last week. Overall interested again if we hit $116, but low confidence we'll sell off again. \n\nCurrently long.\n\n**Sector Context:** Not much to really say about this beyond NVDA having the most advanced chips that are widespread for training because of the CUDA architecture- most people are doubtful that the TOTAL cost was $6M\n\nUS Officials are examining export restrictions but China will likely find a way to bypass them as they have previously.\n\n**Risks:** Mainly geopolitical, again. Obviously it's very difficult to restrict trade to a country that we have no military presence in or surround, and China is economically far more powerful than those we have attempted trade restrictions on in the past.\n\n**Related tickers:** (Mentioned above)\n\n**Earnings today:** AAPL, INTC, V,TEAM",

Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average were fractionally lower.\n*****\n> Shares of Meta Platforms and Tesla gained 1% and 2%, respectively, while Microsoft shares dipped more than 4% after the companies reported earnings. Meta beat on top and bottom lines, but Microsoft shares faltered after the company\u2019s quarterly revenue forecast disappointed. Tesla shrugged off an earnings and revenue miss. On the other hand, revenue misses from UPS and Caterpillar weighed the indexes down.\n*****\n> Other \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d names are set to report in the coming days, with Apple\u2019s results being due for a Thursday release. Amazon will soon follow suit, as the megacap tech company reports next week.\n*****\n> On Wednesday, all three major averages ended the session lower as a 4% decline in Nvidia weighed on the market. The declines came after the Fed paused its interest rate-cutting campaign, leaving its borrowing rate unchanged in a range between 4.25% and 4.5%. In their post-meeting statement, policymakers noted that inflation remains \u201csomewhat elevated.\u201d\n*****\n> \u201cThe implication is that we\u2019re on hold until the inflation rate goes down, and unfortunately it\u2019s probably not going to go down very much in the several months ahead, so I wouldn\u2019t be looking for rate cuts at the next meeting,\u201d Jeffrey Gundlach, DoubleLine Capital CEO, said Wednesday on CNBC\u2019s \u201cClosing Bell.\u201d\n*****\n> \u201cWe have a relatively stable place where we\u2019re standing, and it kind of supports the fact that the market is in a calm position right now, and so is [Jerome] Powell apparently,\u201d he said.\n*****\n> On the economic data front, the fourth-quarter gross domestic product reading is due on Thursday, and weekly jobless claims are out in the morning.

    "selftext": "**Thoughts:** Obviously good for companies that are involved in the sat comm business (but may be bad/neutral for sat comm companies that do not work with AAPL such as GSAT), TMUS, and AAPL. TSLA is also possibly affected because SpaceX trades as a proxy to TSLA news. VZ/T/other phone providers may be affected but the use case is so niche that I won't hold my breath. \n\n>Apple Inc. has been secretly working with SpaceX and T-Mobile US Inc. to add support for the Starlink network in its latest iPhone software, providing an alternative to the company\u2019s in-house satellite-communication service.\n\n>\n\n>The companies have been testing iPhones with the Starlink service from Elon Musk\u2019s Space Exploration Technologies Corp., according to people with knowledge of the matter. In an under-the-radar move, the smartphone\u2019s latest software update \u2014 released Monday \u2014 now supports the technology.\n\n>\n\n>The tie-up comes as a surprise: T-Mobile has previously only specified Starlink as an option for Samsung Electronics Co. phones, such as the Z Fold and S24 models. Apple, meanwhile, already provides a Globalstar Inc. offering that lets consumers send texts and contact emergency responders when out of cellular range.\n\n>\n\n>T-Mobile has begun allowing customers to sign up for an early version of the Starlink service, and this week the carrier enabled a small number of iPhones as part of a beta test.\n\n>\n\n>The first users received text messages from T-Mobile saying, \u201cYou\u2019re in the T-Mobile Starlink beta. You can now stay connected with texting via satellite from virtually anywhere. To start experiencing coverage beyond, please update to iOS 18.3.\u201d Users in the program have a new toggle switch in their iPhone cellular data settings to manage the satellite feature.\n\n>\n\n>An Apple spokesperson declined to comment, while T-Mobile said that the test will \u201cbegin with select optimized smartphones\u201d and that the full launch will \u201csupport the vast majority of modern smartphones.\u201d T-Mobile has also opened the beta to some users running Android 15, the latest version of the Google operating system. A representative for SpaceX didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\n>\n\n>Ever since Apple teamed up with Globalstar to offer satellite features in 2022, there\u2019s been speculation over whether it might support competing networks. The day after Apple\u2019s 2022 announcement, Musk posted on X that his company has \u201chad some promising conversations with Apple about Starlink connectivity.\u201d\n\n>\n\n>Here\u2019s how it will work: When a T-Mobile iPhone is in an area without cellular connectivity, devices that are part of the Starlink program will first try to pair with SpaceX satellites. Users will also be able to enable texting via the satellite menu for the Globalstar service or contact emergency services through Apple.\n\n>\n\n>The initial version of Starlink is exclusively for texting. But SpaceX and T-Mobile have said that they plan to expand into data connections and voice calls in the future. The program also is only available in the US for now. That contrasts with Apple\u2019s Globalstar service, which works in several countries. SpaceX is looking to expand Starlink to other carriers globally.\n\n>\n\n>There\u2019s another major difference between the two services. The current Apple feature requires users to point their iPhone to the sky to find a satellite. The Starlink option, meanwhile, is designed to work automatically \u2014 even when the phone is in a customer\u2019s pocket.\n\n>\n\n>Both the Starlink and Apple satellite features are designed to work in off-the-grid areas, such as hiking trails, that don\u2019t have cellular service. The capabilities can\u2019t be used in places where a mobile-phone network is within reach. Support for the Apple feature is available on most current iPhone models and the company plans to bring it to its Ultra smartwatch later this year, Bloomberg News has reported.\n\n>\n\n>T-Mobile updated its website this week to tell beta testers that the iPhone is supported as part of the iOS 18.3 software release. As of now, the number of users in the beta is minimal, with T-Mobile planning to expand the program in February. Apple\u2019s announcement of iOS 18.3 touted AI features and bug fixes, but it didn\u2019t disclose the Starlink support.\n\n>\n\n>SpaceX requested authority to begin beta-testing the service starting Monday. The Federal Communications Commission granted SpaceX conditional approval for its satellites to supplement T-Mobile\u2019s cellular network in November.\n\nLink: [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-29/apple-and-spacex-link-up-to-support-starlink-satellite-network-on-iphones](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-29/apple-and-spacex-link-up-to-support-starlink-satellite-network-on-iphones)",

    "title": "The Case for TSLA: the Business Value",
    "selftext": "Many people consider TSLA to be overvalued based on fundamentals. Make no mistake - it absolutely is... based on fundamentals.\n\nThe value of TSLA, beyond the Twitter-political volatility, comes from its proven track record in achieving the impossible.\n\n**Breaking Into an Otherwise Unbreakable Car Market**\n\nHow many new Western car companies can you recall successfully breaking into the market in the last few decades?\n\nThe only real answer is TSLA.\n\nEverything else is bleeding money, a penny stock, or a YouTube car review channel side quest.\n\n**Popularizing an Otherwise Undesirable and Impossible Product**\n\nBefore the EV boom, any consideration of a successful EV business would be immediately countered with legitimate concerns.\n\nThe car community wouldn't be very excited without their loud 4L V8 engines.\n\nThe product would be impossible to make as the batteries would be expensive, heavy, unreliable, and yield a low driving range. If you did get an EV, you wouldn't be able to charge it since there were no charger networks.\n\nNot to mention the expected environmental returns from selling EVs, but generally disrupting the market and directing it towards sustainable energy cars. I love my fuel-hungry loud 6-cylinder German beast, but ICE engines in the mainstream have an expiration date and will eventually become a niche when the larger market transitions to EVs. TSLA takes the credit for this - singlehandedly. Everybody else follows.\n\n**Scaling Up: Actually Selling Cars**\n\nTesla is [still leading](https://www.automotivedive.com/news/electric-vehicle-sales-us-2024-increase-cox-automotive/737528/) EV sales, and is in the [top 10](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/01/06/top-10-best-selling-cars-in-the-us-in-2023.html) of all car sales. Meanwhile, VW is closing down their factories in Germany.\n\n**Advertisement by Word of Mouth**\n\nYou see Ford Focus 1.0 EcoBoost billboard ads everywhere in Europe, and RAM / JEEP / Chevy Silverado / F-150 / Hyundai / Kia ads everywhere in the US.\n\nTSLA built itself on word of mouth and a vision for the future, which is a testament to its value for customers.\n\n**Elon's Proven Track Record in Business**\n\n[Winning](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/16/science/spacex-moon-nasa.html) NASA award contracts in competition with Blue Origin and other space companies, [catching](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp66ye6ep63o) skyscraper sized objects landing, and a Roadster [roaming](https://www.astronomy.com/science/astronomers-just-deleted-an-asteroid-because-it-turned-out-to-be-elon-musks-tesla-roadster/) through space are just a few of the business and technological achievements of Elon Musk (not to mention the side quests). With someone so unreasonably effective at building things that work, investors project that TSLA is a safe and promising bet.\n\nHow many reusable rockets has anybody else caught landing recently?\n\n**Criticisms**\n\nNo product or company is without criticisms. From the bad build quality, to the still-unfulfilled FSD promises, to the lack of Cybertrucks in Europe, to the removal of the turn signal stalks; and most recently, the political criticisms.\n\n**Consequential Actions, Not Ideologies, Drive the World**\n\nThe bottom line for a business is creating products and services that people love, and there are *zero* indicators that TSLA, as a business, is going anywhere. It thrives *despite* all criticism (of which I do think most is reasonable) and lack of marketing, which is a testament to the value they provide.\n\n**Market Temper Tantrums Are a Feature, Not a Bug**\n\nLook beyond the ephemeral temper tantrum-driven volatility of the market.\n\nLast year, in March, GOOG dipped from 160 to 135 when Gemini generated some questionable images; today it's close to ATH at >200.\n\nLast year, in August, CRWD dipped from 380 to 220 when they pushed out a buggy update. (How dare they, a software company, pushing a buggy update?!) Today, it's trading close to ATH again.\n\nToday, the market finally noticed DeepSeek and is going through yet another mental breakdown.\n\nIt is like a palm tree: it will bend but it won't break.\n\nLearn to put your prejudices aside and buy companies that execute well - not companies with a nice little PR team that will sweet talk you.\n\n**But Is It Overpriced?**\n\nBy traditional fundamentals analysis - of course it is. But we've already established there's nothing traditional about TSLA as a company, so your little P/E ratio calculations won't work. They have failed consistently.\n\nLook at the execution of TSLA and compare it to its Western competitors - they aren't even in the same league.",

    "title": "XPEL: Analyzing Growth Potential in the Automotive Market",
    "selftext": "Here\u2019s my condensed analysis of XPEL: FYI: I focus on uncovering companies with strong growth potential and sharing my insights.\n\n**Note:** All hyperlinks will lead you to direct source material \n\n**Disclaimer:** I **DO NOT** own shares of XPEL at the time of writing\n\nI would love to hear from the community and have a in-depth conversation from ya'll. Thank you & enjoy!\n\n# Macro Overview:\n\n**Electric Vehicle Growth**\n\nThe U.S. EV market is projected to show annual growth of 10.54% from 2025-2029, resulting in a market value of $156.3 billion by 2029 [according to Statista.](https://www.statista.com/outlook/mmo/electric-vehicles/united-states) Unit sales alone are projected to reach 2.32 million units by 2029 as well. Consumers now have significantly more choices when shopping for an electric vehicle. They can choose from offerings by [Tesla](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA/), [Ford](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/F/), [GM](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GM/), [Honda](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/HMC/), Hyundai, and many others.\n\nEV's often have unique aesthetic and maintenance needs that typically have high-quality protective films and coatings. The growth in consumer adoption of EV's coincides with Xpel products, particularly on the impact in the aftermarket. EV owners value vehicle preservation. This creates a growing market share for XPEL'S products. These products also include heat-reducing window films that indirectly enhance battery performance.\n\n**Aging Vehicles**\n\nThe average car or truck on the road in the U.S in 2024, was more than 12.6 years old, a new record according to [S&P Global](https://www.spglobal.com/mobility/en/research-analysis/fuel-for-thought-average-age-vehicles-2024.html#:~:text=Vehicles%20on%20the%20road%20are,by%20two%20months%20over%202023.). Consumers now choose to keep cars longer than they used to. This is largely because of the increases in new vehicle prices. As these older vehicles age, the demand for general maintenance and preservation are more-likely to rise.\n\nCar price increases have climbed for four consecutive months, according to [Kelley Blue Book data](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/after-4-straight-months-price-increases-new-car-now-costs-nearly-50000). As of December 2024, the average price of a new vehicle was $49,740, the second-highest level ever recorded. Economic uncertainty and higher costs can discourage new purchases. This situation favors repairs and maintenance of existing vehicles as the fleet continues to get older before replacement.\n\n**Technological advancements**\n\n[Self-healing films](https://www.xpel.com/products/paint-protection-film/ultimate-plus?srsltid=AfmBOopjFd4lU0Io05gEI-r8EsK9Z7gIDE7DRjI1mI7yEhQAFqPDeofN) from XPEL and competitors [3M](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MMM/), [Eastman Performance Films](https://www.eastman.com/en/who-we-are/locations/fieldale-va-usa), and [STEK Automotive](https://www.stekautomotive.com/) were released much earlier. They have recently gained traction as consumers want paint protection film to protect their vehicles. Self-healing films use polymer capable of automatically repairing minor scratches and abrasions when exposed to heat. As vehicles on the road become increasingly older, the demand for reduced effort in maintaining a vehicle's exterior will increase. Vehicle owners will likely seek easier maintenance solutions with minimal effort that repel against water, dirt, and scratches more easily. Consumers and manufacturers are increasingly adopting self-healing films. People who want to protect their older vehicles find XPEL appealing. It is also chosen to keep luxury cars in pristine condition.\n\n# Investment Thesis:\n\nXPEL is a compelling investment with an attractive growth story in the automotive sector. It is supported by a strong brand presence, international expansion growth, and financial strength. With high expectations, investors should take notice in the premium valuation risks apparent. Long-term growth is certainly compelling but there are clear short-term headwinds including macroeconomic uncertainties that require careful monitoring.\n\n* **Product Diversification:** XPEL is widely known for their paint protection films. These films contribute to 70% of total Q3 sales and grew by 2.7%. Still, products like their window film and ceramic coatings have outperformed with growth of 20.6%. [Non-automotive products](https://s204.q4cdn.com/619560229/files/doc_presentations/2024/11/Q3-2024-XPEL-Investor-Presentation.pdf) like home & office window films, antimicrobial film, and niche surface protection film also out-performed by 11.6%. Together, both segments contributed 30% to total sales. Impressive growth outperformance though has largely been a significant reason for overall revenue growth in recent quarters.\n* **International Expansion:** U.S. sales are the largest contributor to total revenue, accounting for 57.2% of the total and reaching $64.6 million in Q3, reflecting year-over-year growth of 9.4%. Despite the reliance on U.S. sales, International sales continue to outperform. Canada is the second largest contributor at 12.8% of revenue with growth of 25.7% to $14.4 million. All international markets saw growth except for the third largest market which is China. China saw a significant decline of -11.6% to just $9.06 million. The decrease was primarily attributed to XPEL's distributor working through excess inventory levels. With only a weighting of 8% of total sales, the negative growth did not hurt overall sales significantly. While XPEL faced challenges in China as well as minor growth of 4.1% and 1.4% in Europe and the U.K, strong international performance lead to record revenue.\n* **Strategic Partnerships:** XPEL has established multiple strategic partnerships to expand its market presence. Recent collaborations with brands like [Tesla](https://lp.xpel.com/tesla-window-film), [Kia](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20241030688212/en/XPEL-Showcases-New-Products-and-Collaborations-at-SEMA-2024), exclusive [Rivian](https://s204.q4cdn.com/619560229/files/doc_news/XPEL-and-Rivian-Expand-Collaboration-With-New-PPF-and-Window-Film-Program-2024.pdf) supplier partnership, [BMW](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20241030688212/en/XPEL-Showcases-New-Products-and-Collaborations-at-SEMA-2024), and [Team Penske](https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelharley/2024/07/10/xpel-partners-with-team-penske-to-protect-indycars-and-drivers/) have been formed. These collaborations, including with service providers like [Tint World](https://www.tintworld.com/news-media/news-and-press/industry-leaders-tint-world-and-xpel-announce-partnership/), have strengthened market presence. Brand visibility and revenue growth have also increased as a result. The Tesla partnership in particular is of major importance due to their dominance in the EV market. These recent collaborations integrate XPEL's wide array of products into solutions for high-profile vehicles and events. The partnerships with Tesla and Rivian are particularly significant. They expand their reach into the electric vehicle market that continues to rapidly grow in the U.S. and internationally.\n\n# Risk Factors:\n\n* **Reliance On Chinese Distribution:** [Potential tariff threats to China](https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/us-importers-rush-goods-china-trump-tariff-threat-looms-2025-01-15/) from a new administration will significantly impact XPEL if enacted. If new tariffs are applied, XPEL will be faced with increases in far materials leading to higher production costs. With the U.S market as the largest source of revenue at 57.2%, passing on further costs to consumers would likely reduce demand. Most importantly, reliance on one distributor could lead to supply chain constraints due to an over-reliance on one company. Price increases or delayed deliveries would harm relationships and hurt XPEL's brand.\n* **The Culper Research Short Report:** On October 19, 2023, [Culper Research issued a short report](https://img1.wsimg.com/blobby/go/cc91fda7-4669-4d1b-81ce-a0b8d77f25ab/downloads/Culper_XPEL_10-19-2023.pdf?ver=1733419998410) sending XPEL's stock retreating -17.3% from $51.51 per share to $42.61. A notable accusation was XPEL's understated reliance on Tesla. [XPEL responded](https://ppfmag.com/short-seller-targets-xpel/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) by stating Tesla represented just 5% of 2023 revenue. Secondly, Culper believes XPEL is concealing a massive risk. Their primary supplier, \"Entrotech, Inc\", has formed a [joint venture with PPG Industries](https://news.ppg.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2023/PPG-launches-paint-films-solutions-for-automotive-and-industrial-customers/default.aspx) on May 23, 2023. Lastly, Culper's claim as seen below, would have massive repercussions for XPEL if they are correct.\n* **Additional Culper Info:** The validity of Culper's claims on XPEL and others have been [called into question many times](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/827876/000166357721000030/ex99_1.htm) for self-benefiting public statements. What we do know for sure is the joint venture with PPG Industries is in fact truthful. The extent of which XPEL will become obsolete on the other is a highly questionable take. For some reason, Culper did not mention that XPEL stands out due to their DAP software. It is not because of the PPF raw material. Hence, XPEL would know exactly how much material and company their products were installed on. These allegations were made in 2023. XPEL has continued to show strong growth. The company has not skipped a beat.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nXPEL offers an attractive growth story in the automotive industry. This growth is supported by their strong market position and international expansion. The company also has a diverse product portfolio and strategic partnerships. A P/E ratio of 23.98 certainly wouldn't be viewed as cheap by any measures. Still, their P/E is significantly below their five-year average P/E of 41.6. Long-term growth remains compelling with the expectation of double-digit growth in the next two years.\n\nNonetheless, there are near-term headwinds. Sure, XPEL has displayed a history of growth, but near-term macroeconomic uncertainties regarding tariff concerns are worth monitoring. XPEL must consider how to react to such challenges since their distributor is based in China. For the reasons noted above, we still believe XPEL is a compelling BUY. It offers long-term sustainable growth, strategic partnerships, international expansion, and a strong balance sheet.",

    "title": "China Discusses Sale of TikTok US to Musk as One Possible Option",
    "selftext": "Bloomberg: Chinese officials are evaluating a potential option that involves\u00a0Elon Musk\u00a0acquiring the US operations of TikTok if the company fails to fend off a controversial ban on the short-video app, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nBeijing officials strongly prefer that TikTok remains under the ownership of parent\u00a0ByteDance Ltd., the people say, and the company is contesting the impending ban with an appeal to the US Supreme Court. But the justices signaled during arguments on Jan. 10 that\u00a0they are likely\u00a0to uphold the law. Senior Chinese officials had already begun to debate contingency plans for TikTok as part of an expansive discussion on how to work with\u00a0Donald Trump\u2019s administration, one of which involves Musk, said the people, asking not to be identified revealing confidential discussions.\n\nA potential high-profile deal with one of Trump\u2019s closest allies holds some appeal for the Chinese government, which is expected to have some say over whether TikTok is ultimately sold, said the people. Musk spent more than $250 million supporting Trump\u2019s re-election, and has been tapped for a prominent role in improving government efficiency after the Republican takes office.\n\nUnder one scenario that\u2019s been discussed by the Chinese government, Musk\u2019s X \u2014 the former Twitter \u2014 would take control of TikTok US and run the businesses together, the people said. With more than 170 million users in the US, TikTok could bolster X\u2019s efforts to attract advertisers. Musk also founded a separate artificial intelligence company, xAI, that could benefit from the huge amounts of data generated from TikTok.\n\nChinese officials have yet to reach any firm consensus about how to proceed and their deliberations are still preliminary, the people said. It\u2019s not clear how much ByteDance knows about the Chinese government discussions or whether TikTok and Musk have been involved. It\u2019s also unclear whether Musk, TikTok and ByteDance have held any talks about the terms of any possible deal.\n\nMusk and his representatives did not respond to a request for comment. Musk\u00a0posted in April\u00a0that he thinks TikTok should remain available in the US. \u201cIn my opinion, TikTok should not be banned in the USA, even though such a ban may benefit the X platform,\u201d he wrote on X. \u201cDoing so would be contrary to freedom of speech and expression. It is not what America stands for.\u201d\n\nByteDance and TikTok representatives didn\u2019t respond to messages seeking comment. The Cyberspace Administration of China and China\u2019s Ministry of Commerce, government agencies that could be involved in decisions about TikTok\u2019s future, also didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe talks in Beijing suggest that TikTok\u2019s fate may no longer be in ByteDance\u2019s sole control, said the people. Chinese officials recognize they will face tough negotiations with the Trump administration over tariffs, export controls and other issues, and they see the TikTok negotiations as a potential area for reconciliation, they said.\n\nThe Chinese government holds a so-called golden share in a ByteDance affiliate that gives it influence over the company\u2019s strategy and operations. TikTok maintains that the control only applies to the China-based subsidiary Douyin Information Service Co., and has no bearing on ByteDance operations outside China. Still, Beijing\u2019s export rules prevent Chinese companies from selling their software algorithms, like the one integral to TikTok. Because the Chinese government would have to approve of a sale that includes TikTok\u2019s valuable recommendation engine, it has a significant voice in any possible deal.\n\nTikTok\u2019s US operations could be valued at\u00a0around $40 billion to $50 billion, Bloomberg Intelligence analysts Mandeep Singh and Damian Reimertz estimated last year. That\u2019s a substantial sum even for the world\u2019s richest person. It\u2019s not clear how Musk could pull off such a transaction, whether it would require the sale of other holdings, or whether the US government would approve. He paid $44 billion for Twitter in 2022, and is still paying off sizable loans.\n\nMusk has a positive reputation among many ByteDance employees in China, according to a person familiar with the matter. He is seen as a very successful entrepreneur, who has experience engaging with the Chinese government through his\u00a0Tesla Inc.\u00a0business, the person added.\n\nByteDance\u2019s leaders have repeatedly said their priority is to fight US legislation that requires the Beijing-based company sell or shut down the US operations because of national security concerns. TikTok\u2019s lawyers have argued the legislation violates free speech laws under the Constitution\u2019s First Amendment.\n\nA majority of the Supreme Court justices suggested the security concerns take priority over free speech, although they have yet to issue a formal decision. President-elect Trump, who takes office Jan. 20, has sought to delay the TikTok ban \u2014 which takes effect Jan. 19 \u2014 so he can work on the negotiations. He has said he wants to \u201csave\u201d the app and there\u2019s been speculation he could take last-minute action to sidestep the ban.\n\nOn a practical level, spinning off TikTok\u2019s US business would be highly complex, affecting shareholders in China as well as the US. Lawyers for TikTok argued before the Supreme Court that separating the US portions of the product would be \u201cextraordinarily difficult.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s unclear if US TikTok would be sold off in a competitive process, or if a sale would be arranged by the government. Billionaire Frank McCourt and \u201cShark Tank\u201d investor Kevin O\u2019Leary are part of a bid through Project Liberty to acquire TikTok, which O\u2019Leary has\u00a0said he\u00a0discussed with Trump. In the past,\u00a0Microsoft Corp.\u00a0had sought to acquire the business, and\u00a0Oracle Corp.\u00a0has a deep technology partnership with the company.\n\nOne alternative for TikTok would be to move its existing US customers over to a similar app \u2014 with different branding \u2014 to potentially sidestep the ban, one of the people said. It\u2019s not clear how effective such a move would be.\n\nOne person close to the company, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the strategy, said before the Supreme Court hearing that the legal battle is still the focus of top executives and they would prefer to keep fighting in the US rather than sell TikTok US and cede control for good.\n\nMusk is in a position to influence the China-US relationship as the world\u2019s richest person with businesses that straddle the world\u2019s two largest economies. Tesla, where Musk is chief executive officer, erected a sprawling factory in Shanghai in 2019 and has since expanded the facility into the company\u2019s largest production base. The effort helped Tesla expand its market share in China despite tough local competition, and build goodwill with government officials.\n\nWhile Trump is staffing his incoming administration with China hawks like Secretary of State nominee\u00a0Marco Rubio, Musk has spoken out against some recent China trade policies, including the Biden administration\u2019s tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles.\n\n[Link](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-14/china-discusses-sale-of-tiktok-us-to-musk-as-one-possible-option)\n\n**Thoughts:** Obviously this type of news has the ability to move TSLA/META/social networks. We've seen TSLA make moves from political news, SpaceX news, Twitter news, and TSLA trades as a proxy to whatever Elon Musk is doing at the time even if it's not directly applicable to TSLA as a company. \n\nVery low probability of it happening but interesting to brainstorm trading ideas. \n\nAnd hey, Bloomberg's writing about it so it's not random ravings of a lunatic on the internet.",

Arcadium is currently dealing with legal challenges from a section of its shareholders.\n\nThese shareholders have lodged lawsuits against the company, accusing it of misrepresentation, concealment, and negligence in relation to the takeover deal. This information was disclosed by Arcadium in a regulatory filing earlier this month.\n\nEarlier in the year, Rio Tinto stated its intention to acquire Arcadium at a price of $5.85 per share, which was paid in cash. This purchase price represented a nearly 90% premium on Arcadium's closing stock price on October 4, the day a potential deal was first reported by Reuters.\n\nThe acquisition will grant Rio Tinto access to Arcadium's lithium mines, processing facilities, and deposits located in Argentina, Australia, Canada, and the United States.\n\nAdditionally, Rio Tinto will also inherit Arcadium's customer base, which includes major automotive manufacturers such as Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), BMW (ETR:BMWG), and General Motors (NYSE:GM).",

    "selftext": "For context, I've been buying stocks and options since I turned 18 around 3 months ago, so I don't have a lot of experience or knowledge in the first place. I've just been making moves based on my own research combined with other people's ideas. I was looking through a discord where people share their ideas as I wanted to expand my portfolio past being 65% NVDA and 35% random bullshit, and I often see these pictures of daily 5 minute candles with countless horizontal, diagonal, and curvy lines. The poster then mentions various names for some candlestick patterns and says something about how the stock closed above/under the EMA or some crap then proceeds to justify their following move, seeming to have full confidence because of this chart they drew.\n\nSo I thought, if I could go by the book and use rules and numbers to get a solid guess on which way the stock's gonna go, I'd be rich. But if it were that easy, everyone would be rich. And one look through this r/wallstreetbets makes it clear that there's not a lot of people who have achieved that status.\n\nI'm posting to ask if learning about all this is worth it. I know that the market is unpredictable and there's no way looking at a bunch of lines will give me a positive winrate, but does it help? For example, could you have a better chance at guessing what's gonna happen in the next 30 minutes if you recognized the pattern that came before it? I know that I cannot expect the book to be right all the time, but would it at least give me a better shot at it?\n\nI haven't tried this at all and so far I've been doing fine, though I know the stuff I've bought have been nice to me in the months I've held it and I can't expect the same in the future (I started with 7k, now at 9k, with 50% of gains unrealized from mostly NVDA and RKLB, 50% of gains realized from TSLA and NVDA calls bought post-election). I know reading these patterns won't help in the long run, as I'm holding shares and am not planning to sell in the foreseeable future, but I want to understand what these people are talking about when they do TAs and try it for myself to see if it actually helps or not. Maybe try buying 0dte for SPY and QQQ to harvest some loss porn for WSB.\n\nThanks in advance.",

    "selftext": "Purpose of this post is to get a sense of 'sentiment' about Siemens. It's not a lazy $hit post, asking \"what do y'all think yo\"? But yeah, essentially, that's what I am asking, besides listing down a long list of pros and cons of the company.\n\nI've no position yet (long or short), but thinking of it.\n\nPros:\n\n1. The conglomerate needs no introduction. There's virtually NO piece of any complex, industrial machinery (boats, planes, turbines, large diesel engines, data center infrastructure, heating, cooling, all kinds of factories, power plant, high voltage transformer...) that doesn't have at least a few critical components made by Siemens. The company stands to benefit from **energy transition, mobility, urbanization** (smart cities), and is focused on **high-margin** specialized components.\n2. Valuations: 18 PE, 1.9 PS [Siemens AG - Google Finance](https://www.google.com/finance/quote/SIE:ETR?window=YTD)\n3. News: there's plenty of positive news and developments [Google News ](https://news.google.com/search?for=siemens&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en) Most notably, partnership with NVDA for industrial robotics applications. Won a few contracts in the middle East. \n4. Gaining momentum: for last 10 days at least, the trading volume is virtually all **BUY volume**. BUY volume means the trades were executed at 'ask' price. Buyers had to up their bids to get hands on the stock.\n5. Low retail concentration: only 19% retail shareholders. Less susceptible to 'crowd' thinking. It's not your GME or TSLA which will up/down 10% in a day. Movements will be very slow and steady. In other words, low volatality. It's a steady wealth builder with 14% YTD; don't expect 500% in 5 years.\n\nCons:\n\n1. German company. Yes, yes, we know Germany is in recession, aging population, generally hard business climate.. etc etc. But the company's operations are global. The only geographical 'risk' is, you've a stock in EUR currency, not traded as ADR on US exchange (as far as I know). Revenues come from all over the world, in many currencies.\n2. Lot of competition: ABB, GE, Hitachi, Mitsubishi, Larsen & Toubro.. may not be retail, well known names, but they all do the same stuff, some better; some worse. It's all about winning a large government / private contracts.",

    "selftext": "\n\nShares of Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) saw a 4% increase in pre-open trading Tuesday, reflecting investor confidence following the company's unveiling of its new quantum computing chip, Willow. Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google, introduced the chip on Monday, highlighting its ability to significantly reduce computational errors and its performance in benchmark tests.\n\nPichai emphasized the chip's potential in practical applications, stating, \"We see Willow as an important step in our journey to build a useful quantum computer with practical applications in areas like drug discovery, fusion energy, battery design + more.\"\n\nThe new chip, according to Pichai, has achieved two major milestones. It can exponentially decrease errors with the addition of more qubits, addressing a quantum error correction challenge that has persisted for nearly three decades. In addition, Willow completed a standard benchmark computation in less than five minutes, a task that would take one of the fastest supercomputers today more than 10 septillion years.\nThis development is part of Google's long-term commitment to quantum computing, a vision that began over a decade ago when Pichai founded Google Quantum (NASDAQ:QMCO) AI in 2012. \n\nThe goal is to build a quantum computer that leverages quantum mechanics to advance scientific discovery and address societal challenges.\n\nThe announcement drew a simple yet telling reaction from Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk, who expressed his astonishment with a single word, \"wow,\" on social media platform X.\n\nThe Willow chip represents a significant advancement for Google Quantum AI and positions the company closer to achieving commercially viable quantum computing applications.",

    "selftext": "[https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/business/2024/11/17/trump-team-said-to-want-to-ease-us-rules-for-self-driving-cars/](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/business/2024/11/17/trump-team-said-to-want-to-ease-us-rules-for-self-driving-cars/)\n\n  \nTSLA +5% overnight due to this news.\n\n  \n(Bloomberg) -- Members of President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s transition team have told advisers they plan to make a federal framework for fully self-driving vehicles one of the Transportation Department\u2019s priorities, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nIf new rules enable cars without human controls, that would directly benefit Elon Musk, the Tesla Inc. chief executive officer and Trump mega-donor who has become a powerful fixture in the president-elect\u2019s inner circle. He has bet the future of the EV maker on self-driving technology and artificial intelligence.\n\nCurrent federal rules pose significant roadblocks for companies looking to deploy vehicles without steering wheels or foot pedals in large quantities, which Tesla plans to do. The Trump team is looking for policy leaders for the department to develop a framework to regulate self-driving vehicles, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be named because they weren\u2019t authorized to speak publicly.\n\nWhile the Transportation Department, through the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, can issue rules that would make it easier to run autonomous vehicles, an act of Congress would clear the way for mass adoption of self-driving cars. A bipartisan legislative measure being discussed in early stages would create federal rules around AVs, two of the people said.\n\nOne candidate under consideration for Transportation secretary is Emil Michael, a former Uber Technologies Inc. executive who has spoken with Trump\u2019s team and potential staffers, they said. The work is in its early stages and policy details have yet to be determined, they said.\u00a0\n\nRepublican Representatives Sam Graves of Missouri and Garret Graves of Louisiana have also been considered to lead the department, the people said.\n\nThe transition team didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.\n\nMusk in October announced plans to produce large numbers of driverless Tesla robotaxis that lack driver controls starting in 2026. Current US regulations pose significant hurdles to Musk\u2019s plans for the so-called Cybercab, including a cap limiting their deployment.\u00a0\n\nHe supported federal rules for autonomy on Tesla\u2019s third-quarter earnings call, saying he\u2019d use any role with the government to push for a process to allow autonomous vehicles to be used nationwide. The pronouncement prompted a selloff of shares of Uber and rival Lyft Inc.\n\nTrump has since named Musk and entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy to lead a new Department of Government Efficiency initiative to \u201cdismantle government bureaucracy\u201d and slash spending and regulations deemed overly burdensome.\n\nPast efforts to come up with federal legislation to regulate autonomous vehicles have stumbled.\n\nNHTSA currently permits manufacturers to deploy 2,500 self-driving vehicles per year under a granted exemption, but legislative efforts to increase that number to as many as 100,000 have repeatedly failed.\n\nA bill to do that sailed through the House several years ago during Trump\u2019s first term, but the measure has been bogged down in the Senate. An attempt during the first year of the Biden administration to merge the bill with other legislation faltered when some manufacturers tried to include language that would prevent consumers from suing or forming class-action cases.",

    "selftext": "* Tesla\u00a0reported third-quarter earnings on Wednesday that topped analysts\u2019 estimates even as revenue came in just shy of expectations.\n\nHere\u2019s what the company reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:\n\n* **Earnings per share:**\u00a072 cents vs. 58 cents expected\n* **Revenue:**\u00a0$25.18 billion vs. $25.37 billion expected\n\nRevenue increased 8% in the quarter from $23.35 billion a year earlier. Net income rose to about $2.17 billion, or 62 cents a share, from $1.85 billion, or 53 cents s share, a year ago.\n\nTesla\u2019s profit margins were bolstered by $739 million in automotive regulatory credit revenue during the quarter. The company has also been offering an array of discounts and incentives to spur sales.\n\nAutomotive revenue increased 2% to $20 billion from $19.63 billion in the same period a year earlier. Energy generation and storage revenue soared 52% to $2.38 billion, while services and other revenue jumped 29% to $2.79 billion.\n\nOperating margin was reported at 10.8% of sales to improve from last quarter's mark of 6.3%, and top last year's mark of 7.6%. Total GAAP gross margin was 19.8% vs. 17.9% a year ago and 18.0% in the prior quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was $4.67 billion vs. $3.76 billion a year ago. For the quarter, the EV juggernaut's adjusted EBITDA margin rose to 18.5% of sales from 16.1% a year ago.\n\n# \n\nTesla had already disclosed 462,890 deliveries for Q3. The electric vehicle maker said it produced 469,796 vehicles during the quarter. Tesla noted that 3% of the deliveries were subject to operating lease accounting. For reference, Tesla delivered 443,956 vehicles in Q2 of this year and 435,059 vehicles in Q3 of last year. Tesla's  all-time deliveries record was 484,507 vehicles in Q4 of 2023. Looking ahead, Tesla reiterated that plans for new vehicles, including more affordable models, remain on track for start of production in the first half of 2025.\n\n# More than just EVs\n\nTesla said energy storage deployments decreased sequentially in Q3 to a record 6.9 GWh, but were up 75% Y/Y. Overall, Tesla said energy services and other businesses are becoming increasingly profitable parts of the company. \"As energy storage products continue to ramp, and our vehicle fleet continues to grow, we are expecting continued profit growth from these businesses over time,\" noted TSLA. The company also said that it deployed and is training ahead of schedule on a 29k H100 cluster at Gigafactory Texas, where it expects to have 50k H100 capacity by the end of October.\n\n# Balance sheet\n\nTesla ended the quarter with a cash position of $33.6 billion. The sequential increase of $2.9 billion was a result of positive free cash flow of $2.7 billion. Operating cash flow was $6.3 billion during the quarter.\n\n**SUMMARY**\n\nWe delivered strong results in Q3 with growth in vehicle deliveries both sequentially and year-on-year, resulting in record third-quarter volumes. We also recognized our second-highest quarter of regulatory credit revenues as other OEMs are still behind on meeting emissions requirements.\n\nOur cost of goods sold (COGS) per vehicle came down to its lowest level ever at \\~$35,100. In order to continue accelerating the world\u2019s transition to sustainable energy, we need to make EVs affordable for everyone, including making total cost of ownership per mile competitive with all forms of transportation. Preparations remain underway for our offering of new vehicles \u2013 including more affordable models \u2013 which we will begin launching in the first half of 2025. At our \"We, Robot\" event on October 10, we detailed our long-term goal of offering autonomous transport with a cost per mile below rideshare, personal car ownership, and even public transit.\n\nThe Energy business achieved another strong quarter with a record gross margin. Additionally, the Megafactory in Lathrop produced 200 Megapacks in a week, and Powerwall deployments reached a record for the second quarter in a row as we continue to ramp Powerwall 3.\n\nDespite sustained macroeconomic headwinds and others pulling back on EV investments, we remain focused on expanding our vehicle and energy product lineup, reducing costs and making critical investments in AI projects and production capacity. We believe these efforts will allow us to capitalize on the ongoing transition in the transportation and energy sectors.",

    "title": "Alphabet To $7 Trillion By 2025?",
    "selftext": "We believe Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) is positioned to grow its valuation by well over 3x from the already huge $2-trillion figure now \u2013 potentially becoming the world\u2019s most valuable company by a huge margin \u2013 as its often-overlooked Waymo autonomous driving business quietly revolutionizes the transportation sector. This would take the stock to over $500 a share. Here\u2019s why.\n\nFact: Waymo has grown the number of weekly paid rides from 10,000 to over 100,000 in the last 12 months. It went from 50,000 weekly rides to 100,000 just in the last six months.\n\nThe growth is compelling and the addressable market is massive\n\nCase in point: Uber does more than 200 million rides each week. Let\u2019s let that sink in. So if autonomous rides can capture even half that market, that would mean 100 million rides per week. That\u2019s about 1,000 times where Waymo is today. 200 million rides a week translates to about a billion a month and over 10 billion a year. At $30 per ride, we\u2019re talking revenues of close to $300 billion per year.\n\nBut wait\u2026 there is more to the growth story\n\nIf Waymo is already delivering over 100,000 driverless rides, how many more people might switch from driving their cars to being driven by autonomous vehicles? The shift could be massive. For each person hailing a cab, there are at least 10 others driving their own cars. Many of these drivers might reconsider once they see millions of people relaxing in the back seat, streaming Netflix, while they\u2019re stuck behind the wheel.\n\nIn fact, early data backs this up. According to Earnest Analytics, Waymo is already retaining riders at a higher rate compared to other ride-hailing services like Uber or Lyft. People enjoy the experience of autonomous vehicles. Safety could also be another attraction. Waymo published a report last year indicating that its autonomous vehicles achieved an 85% reduction in injury-causing crashes compared to national rates for human-operated cars.\n\nInvestors will soon recognize that the $300 billion revenue figure for the current ride-hailing market has substantial growth potential \u2013 it could easily expand by 2-3x. A $1 trillion market for autonomous rides isn\u2019t out of the question. This growth would also translate to significant revenue opportunities for automakers like Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), which are working on their driverless vehicle technologies.\n\nBut wait aren\u2019t so many automakers and tech players working on autonomous driving?\n\nYes, but not all of them are making the same progress. Waymo has a head start in the market. Its main competitor, General Motor\u2019s backed Cruise lost its driverless permits in California after a serious accident, making Waymo the only publicly available robotaxi service in San Francisco. Uber exited its self-driving taxi program about six years ago and has partnered with Waymo to bring its services to the Uber app in some cities. While electric vehicle behemoth Tesla is seen as a leader of sorts in the self-driving space, given its large base of vehicles, it is only slowly getting into the space after the unveiling of its Robotaxi vehicle earlier this month.\n\nWaymo has some advantages in terms of tech as well. It uses a fleet equipped with high-resolution cameras, LiDAR, and radar systems, creating a comprehensive view of its surroundings. And don\u2019t forget Google\u2019s got a secret weapon. It crowdsources annotated data such as CAPTCHA codes from its massive user base, using that to train its machine-learning models. That\u2019s a big advantage in terms of understanding complex driving environments.\n\nThe best part?\n\nThese are self-driving cars \u2013 no human drivers, no unions, no employee or contractor issues, and no human cost. While there will be other expenses, such as software development and battery costs, the absence of driver wages could lead to exceptionally high margins. Margins of 50% aren\u2019t unrealistic when you consider that driver earnings account for a substantial portion of gross fares in traditional ride-hailing models.\n\nIf Waymo can capture about one-third of the $1 trillion autonomous rides market, it could generate annual revenues of around $300 billion. With a 50% margin, that\u2019s a neat $150 billion in profits. What\u2019s that worth? At a 30x earnings multiple, that would imply an additional valuation of about $4.5 trillion for Alphabet. Considering that Alphabet is worth roughly $2 trillion presently, this could take the company\u2019s market cap to over $6.5 trillion, or over $500 per share.\n\nTo be sure, building this sort of scale can take a good deal of time \u2013 quite different from signing up for say a Google or Netflix account. However, investors will need to look well out into the future. Think 2030 (not 2025), maybe even more. The point is not to get stuck \u2013 if you\u2019re concerned, look even further out, say 2035! The bottom line: Alphabet is growing Waymo quickly, has the technology and competitive edge, and is addressing a potentially massive market, making this high valuation within reach.\n\nSource: Alphabet To $7 Trillion By 2025? https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2024/10/23/alphabet-to-7-trillion-by-2025/",

    "selftext": "Tesla\u2019s hyped robotaxi unveiling posed a threat to Uber\u2019s ride-sharing aspirations, but it has turned into a boon for the stock instead.\n\nUber shares had been falling on the initial investor excitement leading up to Thursday\u2019s event \u2014 particularly slumping in early August and mid-September \u2014 but surged more than 9% on Friday on renewed enthusiasm that the company is well positioned to advance its autonomous vehicle offerings. The move pushed the stock to a 52-week high and it was leading the S&P 500 higher during the session.\n\nThat is a massive turnaround for Uber\u2019s stock, which is now up nearly 22% over the past month and about 38% for the year. Lyft, another major player, is also surging about 10% on Friday. By comparison, Tesla\u2019s shares are plunging during Friday\u2019s trading session and are down more than 11% this year, vastly underperforming both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq, which have each gained around 22% so far this year.\n\nThe buzz around Tesla\u2019s highly anticipated cybercab has largely dissipated due to a lack of detail on its latest full self-driving technology advancements and the company\u2019s failure to provide insight on its ride-sharing service strategy or economics, among other expectations investors had.\n\n\u201cTSLA\u2019s toothless taxi is a best-case outcome for UBER,\u201d Jefferies analyst John Colantuoni said in a Friday note, noting that the electric car maker provided ambitious targets but little signs of feasibility.\n\n  \nSource:  [https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/11/ridesharing-giants-uber-lyft-jump-after-teslas-toothless-taxi-fails-to-excite-investors.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/11/ridesharing-giants-uber-lyft-jump-after-teslas-toothless-taxi-fails-to-excite-investors.html)",

    "title": "\nTesla shares drop 6% in premarket after Cybercab robotaxi reveal fails to impress",
    "selftext": "Shares of electric vehicle maker Tesla tumbled Friday after the company\u2019s long-awaited robotaxi event \u2014 where CEO Elon Musk unveiled the firm\u2019s Cybercab self-driving concept car \u2014 failed to impress investors.\n\nTesla stock was down 5.8% as of 6:33 a.m. ET in premarket trading on Friday.\n\nMusk revealed Tesla\u2019s Cybercab concept vehicle \u2014 a low, silver two-seater, has no steering wheels or pedals \u2014 on Thursday night. The plan is for the car to be capable of driving itself autonomously when it launches.\n\nThe Tesla boss said the company hopes to be producing the Cybercab before 2027, but offered no details on where the cars will be manufactured. He said consumers would be able to buy a Tesla Cybercab for a price tag under $30,000.\n\nHe also said he expects Tesla to have \u201cunsupervised FSD\u201d up and running in Texas and California next year in the company\u2019s Model 3 and Model Y electric vehicles. FSD, which stands for Full Self-Driving, is Tesla\u2019s premium driver assistance system, available today in a \u201csupervised\u201d version for Tesla electric vehicles.\n\nThe technology still requires a human driver at the wheel, ready to steer or brake at any time.\n\nIn reaction to the Thursday event, analysts at Barclays said that the revelations had failed to highlight any near-term opportunities for Tesla, instead prioritizing Musk\u2019s vision for a fully autonomous driving future.\n\n\u201cAs expected, like prior Tesla product unveils, the event was light on the details, and instead emphasized the vision underpinning Tesla\u2019s growth endeavors in AI/AV \\[autonomous vehicles\\],\u201d Barclays\u2019 U.S. autos & mobility team wrote in the note early on Friday.\n\n\u201cYet there were no updates indicating near-term opportunities. Tesla didn\u2019t show its low-cost model planned for 1H\u203225 production,\u201d they added. \u201cWe also didn\u2019t get any near-term updates on FSD progress, or data reflecting improvement in the system.\u201d\n\nPiper Sandler analysts said in a separate Friday note that \u201cmost trading-oriented firms will be underwhelmed by the robo-taxi unveiling.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the stock sells off in the coming weeks, as pre-event momentum fizzles,\u201d the investment bank\u2019s analysts said in the note.\n\nMorgan Stanley, meanwhile, suggested that Musk failed to make the case that Tesla is an AI company during the event. The bank\u2019s analysts noted that Musk didn\u2019t mention any details on improvements to Tesla\u2019s FSD system, nor did the billionaire go into detail regarding rumored plans of a tie-up between Tesla and xAI, Musk\u2019s AI company. Musk has previously denied such reports.\n\nThe event \u201coverall disappointed expectations on a number of areas: a lack of data regarding rate-of-change on FSD/tech, ride-share economics and go-to-market strategy,\u201d Morgan Stanley\u2019s analysts wrote in a note Friday.\n\n\u201cWe were overall disappointed with the substance and detail of the presentation. As such, we anticipate TSLA to be under pressure following the event,\u201d they added.\n\nIt is expected to take some years still before self-driving cars become a mainstream reality on public roads, with regulators concerned over the safety features embedded into such vehicles.\n\nAmong the few companies that have successfully launched self-driving cars on public roads is Google\u2019s Waymo, which has offered its robotaxi service to the general public since June.",

    "title": "Tesla stock slips after it reports 462,890 total deliveries during the third quarter",
    "selftext": "Tesla posted its third-quarter vehicle production and deliveries report on Wednesday. The stock fell about 2% in premarket trading after the report.\n\nHere are the key numbers:\n\nTotal deliveries Q3 2024: 462,890\n\nTotal production Q3 2024: 469,796\n\nAnalysts were expecting deliveries of 463,310 in the period ending Sept. 30, according to estimates compiled by FactSet StreetAccount.\n\nDeliveries are not defined in Tesla\u2019s financial disclosures, but are the closest approximation to units sold reported by the company. It\u2019s one of the most closely-watched metrics on Wall Street.\n\nIn the year-ago period, Tesla reported 435,059 deliveries and production of 430,488 EVs. Last quarter, the company reported 443,956 deliveries, and production of 410,831 vehicles.\n\nTesla is facing increased competitive pressure, especially in China, from companies like BYD and Geely, along with a new generation of automakers, including Li Auto and Nio.\n\nIn the U.S., EV competitors like Rivian are maturing, while legacy automakers Ford and General Motors are selling more electric vehicles after walking back more ambitious goals for electrification.\n\nGM this week reported a roughly 60% increase in EV sales for the third quarter from a year earlier. Still, its electric business is tiny compared to Tesla\u2019s, with just 32,100 units sold in the latest period, accounting for 4.9% of the company\u2019s total sales.\n\nFord plans to report results on Wednesday.\n\nTesla hasn\u2019t issued specific guidance for 2024 deliveries, but executives have said they expect a lower delivery growth rate this year versus last despite the company having added a new vehicle, the angular stainless steel Cybertruck, to their lineup.\n\nThe company also said on Wednesday that it deployed 6.9 GWh of energy storage products in the quarter.\n\nShares of Tesla climbed 32% in the third quarter, erasing their loss for the year in the process. The stock is now up almost 4% in 2024, trailing the Nasdaq, which has gained 19%.\n\nTesla\u2019s brand has been under pressure in the U.S. due in part to the antics of CEO Elon Musk, who, in addition to endorsing former President Donald Trump, has shared what the White House called \u201cracist hate,\u201d and false claims about immigrants and election fraud on X, his social media app.\n\nBut Tesla still sells more battery electric vehicles in the U.S. than any other automaker, with Hyundai a distant second.\n\nIn its third-quarter earnings report later this month, investors will be particularly focused on profit margins.\n\nTesla has continued to offer attractive financing options and an array of incentives to drive sales volume in recent months in China as well as in the U.S. Prior to earnings, Tesla will host a marketing event on Oct. 10, and is expected to show off the design of \u201cdedicated robotaxi.\u201d\n\nMusk has promised Tesla self-driving cars for years, but the company has yet to deliver. Meanwhile competitors like Waymo and Pony.ai have begun operating commercial robotaxi services.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/02/tesla-tsla-q3-2024-vehicle-delivery-and-production-numbers.html",

    "title": "The Crash of the stock market has arrived. Price/Earnings ratio just broke 30 for the entire S&P 500. ",
    "selftext": "Almost 90 days ago I made a post in an alternate subreddit regarding why I believe the stock market will begin to crash within 120 days -- Essentially the crash will begin by the day before the election. I have included that entire post below -- and all of these reasons still remain relevant... Moreso than ever with the news from the Middle East today. Obviously the port strike is expediting things today. Nonetheless -- I think the post is super relevant, and for some reason, the moderators of WSB deleted the post after 6 hours, despite it receiving over 2.2 million views, and over 1100 shares. \n\nThe ride the market has been on, quite simply, has been insane.\n\nAccording to generally accepted wisdom -- by investing in the S&P 500, you can anticipate to double your money, on average, every 6.5 years. I'm not 100% certain as to why that's the accepted figure -- as calculating the last 14 6.5 year periods the average rate of return has been 64%.\n\nBelow is a chart of the average price/rate of return of GSPC (The S&P) over the last 14 cycles.. I couldn't easily find data prior to this..\n\n|Year|GSPC Price|6.5 year return on investment|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n||\n|1933.5|10.91||\n|1940|12.05|10.44%|\n|1946.5|18.43|52.95%|\n|1953|26.38|43.13%|\n|1959.5|58.68|122%|\n|1966|92.88|58%|\n|1972.5|107.14|15%|\n|1979|99.93|-7.22%|\n|1985.5|191.85|91.90%|\n|1992|408.78|113%|\n|1998.5|1133.84|177%|\n|2005|1181.27|4.10%|\n|2011.5|1320.64|11.70%|\n|2018|2471.65|87.10%|\n|2024.5|5525.29|123%|\n\nWhile the last two cycles don't necessarily ring any alarm bells -- we have just more than doubled, twice, looking at the last two cycles -- There is one massive, bloated, shit filled elephant in the room... Price to Earnings Ratio.\n\nHistorically, the Price to Earnings ratio for the S&P has sat just under 20 (the easiest data I could find puts it at 19.4x between 1974 and 2017 -- I'm not grabbing any arbitrary dates or numbers here). The Median value has it under 18x, and there have even been extended periods of time where it traded at +/- 10x.\n\nCurrently -- the P/E ratio sits at 28.71 -- roughly 150% of what is normal.\n\nIn the history of the S&P, the P/E ratio has hit this level only 3 times...\n\n* Immediately preceding, and then during, the Dot Com Bubble (P/E broke 30 +/- April 2001).\n* Immediately preceding, and then during, the Global Financial Crisis (P/E broke 30 +/- October 2008).\n* The quarter after Covid hit. (P/E broke 30 +/- March 2020).\n\nImages aren't allowed in this subreddit -- but if you go to the multpl website you will see we finished trading yesterday, 09/30, at a P/E of 30.07\n\nHistorically -- what has happened to the markets after crossing this mark? In all three scenarios, by the time we crossed a P/E of 30, the dam had already started to break.\n\n* During the Dot Com bubble, the S&P 500 was already down 19% from its highs, and would fall another 34% before finally starting to recover. By the the time the bleeding stopped, it had lost 47% of its value.\n* During the global financial crisis, an almost identical story can be told. The S&P had lost 18% of its value by time P/E broke 30, and when it finally bottomed out in February of 2009, it lost 53% of its total value.\n* Covid, obviously, was a much quicker recovery... as we only fell 32%, and had bounced back in less than 6 months time (reason for which outlined later).\n\n**Okay -- so**\u00a0***Maybe***\u00a0**we have a price to earnings ratio problem, but you're still not sold. What else do we have going on?**\n\nOutside of the fact that I firmly believe that the market is overvalued today, I think there are several other major issues that we are facing in the current environment -- and while I could write a diatribe for each, for purposes of succinctness, I'll simply outline them via bullet points below.\n\n* Credit card debt is at an all time high, and outside of a brief period after Covid checks arrived, has been rising since 2013.\n* Younger Americans are in the most trouble with credit card debt. As boomers continue to retire, it will be the working class most disproportionately affected.\n* Credit card delinquency rates are the highest they've been since 2011.\n* Auto loans debt and average auto loan payments are the highest they've been at any point in history. Auto loan delinquency rates are the highest they've been since 2010.\n* The stock market is insanely top heavy right now. The Magnificent 7 (Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), and Tesla (TSLA)) now account for 45% of the entire value of the Nasdaq. They account for roughly 30% of the entire stock market combined. As of today -- they are trading at a combined P/E of 42x. A correction in these 7 companies would be absolutely catastrophic for the entire market as a whole.\n* We are starting to see a weakening of the labor market. Furthermore -- I do not believe the jobs numbers are entirely as they seem. I think many of the jobs 'added' over the last 18 months have been individuals picking up second jobs to help make ends meet. Any reasonable increase in the unemployment rate have absolutely massive consequences.\n* Many banks are holding on to massive unrealized losses. While this has the potential to hit the regional banks the worst, some of the largest banks -- including Bank of America, Charles Schwab, and USAA have unbooked security losses that are greater than 50% of their equity capital.\n* Regional banks are at risk due to the massive amounts of US treasury notes they hold that were bought during Covid. In short -- nobody was borrowing money to buy homes or cars. Banks, flush with cash, took said money and bought US T notes with this money so they could earn some interest on it. This was at a time when interest rates were very low. Now that interest rates are high -- demand for these old t notes is essentially non existent, as you buy new t notes that pay a much higher rate of return. If any sort of bank run starts, these banks will be forced to liquidate said t-bills, and they will have to sell them at a loss. If too many people do this simultaneously, the bank will become insolvent -- like what we saw happen with Silicon Valley bank, Signature Bank and First Republic Bank. (Side note -- the failure of these three banks alone was larger than the combined total of bank failures in 2008 during the global financial crisis).\n* The US government still has a spending problem. Our deficit has grown by $500 million since I started writing this an hour ago.\n* Global tensions are high -- and rising. Massive protests are erupting all over Europe.\n* The US is involved in two proxy wars that don't appear as if they will abate any time soon.\n* The political division in the US is as dramatic as I've seen it at any point in my existence. Perhaps those older and wiser than me can chime in here -- but it seems most are resorting to tribal, identity politics split down party lines.\n* Commercial real estate is starting to buckle. Covid brought about work from home, and with many offices retaining those practices, or allowing partial work from home, office space supply far outpaces demand. This problem is exacerbated by high interest rates. Most commercial loans are done on 5 or 7 year balloon. When that balloon is bout to come due, the owner of that property will refinance the loan, restarting the 5 or 7 year period to avoid paying off the balance owed on the property. Many of these property owners that refinanced into low interest rates in 2020, during covid, when rates bottomed out -- are now having to get a new loan to keep from paying their balloon. However, with interest rates more than twice what they were several years ago, and vacancy rates skyrocketing, many of these real estate owners will not be able to pay the monthly mortgage on their buildings. Commercial Real Estate foreclosures jumped 117% in March alone.\n* Housing has become increasingly less affordable for many Americans. For 2022 -- the most recent year I could find data -- a family earning the median US household income, renting a median priced US home, was spending 40% of their income on rent.\n* Countries are abandoning the US dollar in droves.\n\nI believe some of these issues, on their own, are enough to cause serious economic turmoil. Bundled together, I don't see how we aren't in for a very rude awakening.\n\n**This economic downturn may be severe.**\n\nIn the three times this has happened before -- the action, or lake thereof varied dramatically. During scenario one -- the dot com bubble -- the government largely just let the companies fail. While I was only 11 at the time, my understanding is that there really were no bailouts here because the only people really hurt were the investors in those companies -- unlike scenario two. During the GFC, shuttering banks would have resulted in a complete collapse of the US (and really global) financial system. While I won't get into partisan politics, I'm of the belief that the covid bailouts were entirely unnecessary -- and more importantly for this post -- the reason that the upcoming crash is going to be so insanely problematic.\n\n**Bailouts on any level, whether to companies, banks, or directly to citizens, will inevitably increase inflation. I don't think they are on the table for this correction.**\n\nPeople have painted the inflation problem as a result of supply chain issues... And while supply chain issues didn't help, I think the bigger issue, by far, was the sheer amount of money we printed. You cannot make $4 trillion appear out of thin air and expect that every dollar in circulation isn't going to suddenly become worth less money. We just lived through this reality after the Covid printing.\n\nThis will largely tie the feds hands. Print more money -- we find ourselves in a cycle of ever increasing prices and higher interest rates.\n\n**What happens from here?**\n\nI don't know. Don't listen to me. I'm an idiot.

    "selftext": "* Tesla's FSD, which is now promoted as fully-supervised, is now the core technology behind the robotaxi service the company plans to launch.\n* Most analysts assign hefty value for the FSD technology alone.\n\n  \nWith just two weeks to go for Tesla, Inc.\u2019s TSLA Robotaxi unveil event, an analyst painted a bleak picture of the company\u2019s self-driving technology.\n\n\n\n**What Happened**: Tesla\u2019s FSD, which is now promoted as fully-supervised FSD, is a \u201csafety disaster\u201d and \u201cgalaxies away from being anywhere close to the competition,\u201d said GLJ Research\u2019s Gordon Johnson in a note. Tesla\u2019s competitors in this arena are Alphabet, Inc.\u2019s GOOGL GOOG Waymo and General Motors Corp.\u2019s GM Cruise.\n\n\n\nWith Tesla eyeing the rollout of its Fully Supervised FSD in China, the Elon Musk-led company would be up against domestic player Baidu, Inc.\u2019s BIDU Apollo Go.\n\n\n\nJohnson referenced reviews by two sources to make his case. Independent lab AMCI Testing, which tried the technology, said the overall performance of Tesla\u2019s camera-enabled autonomous-driving software is \u201csuspect.\u201d In a report released on Tuesday, the firm said its evaluation showed how often human intervention was required for safe operation. \u201cIn fact, our drivers had to intervene over 75 times during the evaluation; an average of once every 13 miles,\u201d it said.\n\n\n\nWhile the FSD 12.5.1 was impressive, it is incredibly dangerous for drivers operating with FSD to drive with their hands in their laps or away from the steering wheels, it said. \u201cThe most critical moments of FSD miscalculation are split-second events that even professional drivers, operating with a test mindset, must focus on catching,\u201d it added.\n\n\n\nJohnson also referred to data from [Teslafsdtracker.com](http://Teslafsdtracker.com), which aggregates TSLA FSD driving experiences/data, in real-time from users, which shows that the latest iteration of FSD has a **critical disengagement every 130 miles and every 72 miles when driven in a city.**\n\n  \nData reported by competitors to the California\u00a0Department of Motor Vehicles show that miles to disengagement data for various players are as follows:\n\n* Waymo: 17,311 miles\n* **Amazon, Inc.\u2019s** AMZN Zoox: 177,602 miles\n* [Pony.Ai](http://Pony.Ai) (startup): 17,077 miles\n* WeRide (startup): 21,191 miles\n\nThe **metric for Tesla is 13 miles**, based on AMCI\u2019s statistics, Johnson said, although Tesla doesn\u2019t yet report data to California DMV, given its FSD tech is **only Level 2.**  \n\n\n**Why It\u2019s Important:** Johnson noted that many sell-side analysts assign a valuation of $300 billion to $600 billion for Tesla\u2019s FSD technology. In real-time, the value is close to zero, he said, adding that it could be negative, given the \u201cliability of putting something this dangerous on roads.\u201d\n\n  \nAccording to Ark\u2019s valuation model, by 2029, robotaxis, which has FSD as its core technology, would account for 63% of Tesla\u2019s revenue and 86% of EBITDA.\n\nFuture Fund LLC Managing Partner Gary Black, a Tesla bull, said in a recent post on X that Tesla's FSD is not yet close to the 99.99% efficacy needed for unsupervised autonomy.\n\n\n\nIn premarket trading on Thursday, Tesla rose 2.05% to $262.30\n\n  \nSource: [benzinga.com](https://www.benzinga.com/news/24/09/41047267/safety-disaster-tesla-fsd-galaxies-away-from-being-anywhere-close-to-competition-says-bearish-analys)",

    "selftext": "#Good morning traders and investors of the r/stocks sub! Welcome to the new trading day and a fresh start! Here are your pre-market stock movers & news on this Thursday, September the 5th, 2024-\n\n*****\n\n# [Stock futures are flat after two straight down days for S&P 500, Nasdaq: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/04/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)\n\n*****\n> Stock futures were flat Thursday as Wall Street looks to regain momentum after a rocky start to September. Key labor market data is also on deck this week.\n*****\n> Futures for the S&P 500 were up marginally, while Nasdaq 100 futures hovered near the flatline. Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average edged up 50 points.\n*****\n> The moves come after the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite each closed lower for the second straight session, dipping 0.16% and 0.30%, respectively. The Dow squeezed out a gain of 38 points, or 0.09%, on Wednesday.\n*****\n> All three averages are down for the week, with key employment reports looming. On Thursday morning, investors will get to sift through weekly jobless claims data, while the August nonfarm payrolls report is due out Friday.\n*****\n> The market has appeared to be sensitive to potential growth scares in recent weeks, including Tuesday\u2019s sell-off on the heels of weak manufacturing data. That could put increased importance on the jobless claims data, BMO Wealth Management chief investment officer Yung-Yu Ma said on \u201cClosing Bell.\u201d\n*****\n> \u201cThat\u2019s more of a forward-looking indicator. As long as those stay low \u2014 people have jobs, people remain confident in the ability to find jobs or comfortable in the jobs that they have \u2014 we think that they will continue to spend. So as long as those numbers stay low, if we get some blips in the overall monthly jobs report that shows weakness on the edges, we\u2019re not quite as concerned,\u201d Ma said.\n*****\n> The employment data could play a key role in the Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate decision later this month. Ma said he still believes the U.S. economy is on track for a \u201csoft landing\u201d and that the market rally should eventually broaden out. However, he added that there is likely to be continued market turbulence in the near term.\n*****\n> \u201cWe believe in it, we just think it\u2019s going to be on pause for a few months because this high degree of uncertainty we have right now. There\u2019s just too much that needs to resolved over the coming months. \u2026 It\u2019s just very hard for the broadening-of-the-market theme to really gather momentum,\u201d Ma said.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/HT3VrBW.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx?t=sec_all)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S S&P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Y1XAPs1.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/LGc2mqD.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/SRQa0ET.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/X7MXqat.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/RIVMUq1.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/Qhuavpq.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/4o5lYJ6.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/nibCClQ.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS AFTERNOON'S AFTER-HOURS EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/IvcUiOv.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/0TRP3q0.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/6woP9cp.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/3KB250W.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/jvLQzLa.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!]()**)\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/Ua18Rxf.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/05/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-premarket-ai-tsla-jblu-and-more.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n> **C3.ai** \u2014 The technology stock tumbled 19.2% after on weaker-than-expected subscription revenue during the company\u2019s fiscal first quarter.

    "selftext": "It seems that Morgan Stanley has finally seen the writing on the wall.\n\nMorgan Stanley said it is slashing its position in Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock, citing a \u201ccontinued slowdown in the auto industry, intense competition among electric vehicles (EVs) and reduced consumer preferences\u201d for EVs.\n\nTSLA has been a part of Morgan Stanley\u2019s model portfolio since March 2021, with the position increased in both September and December 2022. However, the stock was reduced in November 2023.\n\nSince the last stake boost in December 2022, Tesla has delivered a 15% return, trailing the Russell 1000 Growth Index (RLG) by 46%, Morgan Stanley strategists highlighted.\n\n\u201cWhile we continue to hold a position in TSLA, due to the optionality of its various nonauto assets, we see an attractive opportunity to reallocate some of the position to other, less-volatile stocks that are not as economically sensitive and may have less pricing pressure,\u201d they wrote.\n\nDespite Tesla\u2019s status as the leading electric vehicle company in the U.S., with potential growth avenues in robotics, AI, and energy storage, the strategists have decided to reduce the position to make room for stocks with higher earnings viability such as Spotify (NYSE:SPOT).\n\nEarlier this week, the European Union announced that it would reduce planned tariffs on Tesla vehicles imported from China, lowering them from 20.8% to 9%. The EU is also cutting planned import duties for several other electric vehicle manufacturers.\n\nThese new tariffs will be in addition to the existing 10% duties already imposed by the EU on battery electric vehicle imports.\n\nIn June, the EU indicated it would impose higher tariffs on Chinese electric vehicle imports, arguing that these vehicles \"heavily benefit from unfair subsidies\" and present a \"threat of economic injury\" to European EV producers.",

I have mostly been doing stock picking based on companies I liked, and unfortunately I have come to the realization that I have missed out on quite a bit of gains from not simply investing in VOO or SPY. My total return on three years of investing is 25% (although last week it peaked at 39%, which probably goes to show that I am over exposed), but had I just put my money in VOO in a dollar cost averaging method, I would likely have a much higher return.\n\nAny advice for me?

    "title": "Analyzing the Analysts: Using average analyst price target to identify buying opportunities amongst the top 100 companies in the S&P",
    "selftext": "Hello everyone,\n\nI'm a lazy investor and don't like to do much due diligence, but I do like to make money. Unfortunately these two things about me are often at odds as I've lost money in the past for not doing my DD. As such, I continue to be lazy but I try and find ways to work around doing due diligence and hopefully finding loop holes.\n\nOne such way that I have been thinking about recently is using analyst ratings, reviews and price targets as a surrogate for due diligence. In essence, I try to just have these analysts do the work for me. The idea is that much in the same way that with those who believe in technical analysis hold that everything you need to know about a stock is baked into it's price action, and so when something good happens the stock price goes up and when something bad happens the stock price goes down, thus all you need is to analyze trends in stock price and you'll be analyzing everything about the stock by proxy, I have a thesis (or theory) that perhaps you can do the same or something similar with analyst price targets of companies.\n\nNow I know that anyone who has read this far already thinks I'm an idiot. Many experienced individual investors probably find market analysts to be stupid and therefore I'm stupid for following their lead, but I would argue to the contrary for a few reasons. As much as I have put in a lot of effort to learn about how the market operates (been investing for the last 6 years, started learning actively about it as much as I could a couple years prior to that), there is still much I don't know as I don't have a finance or economics degree. Moreover, as bad as you may think an analyst is, they are at least competent enough to keep their job as an analyst at the investment firm that allows them to make stock price target selections. Lastly, and most importantly, what I am about to discuss below uses the aggregate of numerous analyst price targets so I'm not relying on a single analyst, but several (probably between 10 and 40 per company). I think if two-dozen analysts are strongly in favor of a company, it is unlikely that my novice investor wisdom would have researched the company and found a flaw that they all missed.\n\nSo what I did yesterday evening was go through the top 100 S&P 500 companies by market cap and find the current average price target for them on Yahoo Finance. I then divided the current stock price (at the close on 7/31) by that price target and expressed it as a percentage to see how far off the company was from the average price target analysts were aiming for. Then I also listed how many total ratings each company had, and how many of them were 'Strong Buys' and 'Buys'.\n\nThis yielded the following table:\n\n|+|A|B|C|D|E|F|G|H|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|1|Company|Current Price|Price Target|Percent to Target|Total Ratings|# Strong Buy Ratings|# Buy Ratings|% of Ratings that were Strong Buys|\n|2|AAPL|222.08|209.76|105.87%|38|11|21|28.95%|\n|3|MSFT|418.35|459.66|91.01%|34|14|13|41.18%|\n|4|NVDA|117.02|125.69|93.10%|38|14|15|36.84%|\n|5|AMZN|186.98|206.43|90.58%|47|15|28|31.91%|\n|6|META|474.83|490.04|96.90%|63|21|34|33.33%|\n|7|GOOG|173.15|185.45|93.37%|5|0|3|0.00%|\n|8|BRK.B|438.5|441.47|99.33%|6|1|3|16.67%|\n|9|LLY|804.27|817.03|98.44%|22|9|8|40.91%|\n|10|AVGO|160.68|180.62|88.96%|29|10|17|34.48%|\n|11|JPM|212.8|200.66|106.05%|28|9|13|32.14%|\n|12|TSLA|232.07|189.09|122.73%|23|0|0|0.00%|\n|13|UNH|576.16|569.6|101.15%|22|11|11|50.00%|\n|14|XOM|118.59|122.83|96.55%|25|5|11|20.00%|\n|15|V|265.67|282.26|94.12%|39|13|22|33.33%|\n|16|JNJ|157.85|158.53|99.57%|23|4|8|17.39%|\n|17|PG|160.76|161.5|99.54%|22|6|4|27.27%|\n|18|MA|463.71|474.87|97.65%|39|14|20|35.90%|\n|19|HD|368.16|355.97|103.42%|33|12|12|36.36%|\n|20|COST|822|886.84|92.69%|29|7|11|24.14%|\n|21|WMT|68.64|68.29|100.51%|32|8|7|25.00%|\n|22|MRK|113.13|132.14|85.61%|21|4|7|19.05%|\n|23|BAC|40.31|41.95|96.09%|30|6|16|20.00%|\n|24|CVX|160.47|167.84|95.61%|24|6|10|25.00%|\n|25|NFLX|628.35|640.43|98.11%|41|11|14|26.83%|\n|26|KO|66.74|64.8|102.99%|25|5|7|20.00%|\n|27|CRM|258.8|274.18|94.39%|45|16|25|35.56%|\n|28|ADBE|551.65|566.58|97.36%|31|11|14|35.48%|\n|29|PEP|172.67|168.65|102.38%|22|10|10|45.45%|\n|30|TMO|613.34|629.42|97.45%|15|8|6|53.33%|\n|31|AMD|144.48|175.48|82.33%|31| | |0.00%|\n|32|LIN|453.5|475.32|95.41%| | | |#DIV/0!|\n|33|ORCL|139.45|140.03|99.59%|36|10|16|27.78%|\n|34|WFC|59.34|59.8|99.23%|31|4|8|12.90%|\n|35|ACN|330.62|348.01|95.00%|29|7|9|24.14%|\n|36|CSCO|48.45|50.56|95.83%|27|8|11|29.63%|\n|37|MCD|265.4|276.47|96.00%|33|8|15|24.24%|\n|38|QCOM|180.95|191.24|94.62%|23|2|7|8.70%|\n|39|GE|170.2|171.93|98.99%|17|5| |29.41%|\n|40|ABT|105.94|124.37|85.18%|20|7|6|35.00%|\n|41|TXN|203.81|187.18|108.88%|32|6|8|18.75%|\n|42|DHR|277.08|284.09|97.53%|17|7|6|41.18%|\n|43|AMGN|332.47|320.24|103.82%|25|3|7|12.00%|\n|44|INTU|647.35|711.36|91.00%|22|6|3|27.27%|\n|45|PM|115.16|115.74|99.50%|18|2|7|11.11%|\n|46|PFE|30.54|29.38|103.95%|22|2|11|9.09%|\n|47|IBM|192.14|172.59|111.33%|25|4|4|16.00%|\n|48|DIS|93.69|123.11|76.10%|30|5|10|16.67%|\n|49|VZ|40.52|45.6|88.86%|32|2|6|6.25%|\n|50|CAT|346.2|337.62|102.54%|24|4|7|16.67%|\n|51|NOW|814.39|807.1|100.90%|34|13|17|38.24%|\n|52|AMAT|212.2|248.8|85.29%|21|4|15|19.05%|\n|53|GS|509.03|476.64|106.80%|27|4|7|14.81%|\n|54|CMCSA|41.27|46.36|89.02%|31|12|18|38.71%|\n|55|SPGI|484.73|521.39|92.97%|15|1|9|6.67%|\n|56|RTX|117.49|103.93|113.05%| | | |#DIV/0!|\n|57|ISRG|444.61|471.87|94.22%|17|6|5|35.29%|\n|58|NEE|76.39|80.23|95.21%|15|5|8|33.33%|\n|59|UNP|246.73|242.11|101.91%|29|5|7|17.24%|\n|60|AXP|253.04|253.26|99.91%|28|6|4|21.43%|\n|61|LOW|245.51|250.99|97.82%|32|8|10|25.00%|\n|62|T|19.25|19.3|99.74%|30|6|3|20.00%|\n|63|HON|204.75|226.96|90.21%|20|7|9|35.00%|\n|64|UBER|64.47|79.96|80.63%| | | |#DIV/0!|\n|65|VRTX|495.72|483.91|102.44%|27|10|12|37.04%|\n|66|MS|103.21|105.64|97.70%|27|3|14|11.11%|\n|67|TJX|113.02|107.04|105.59%|27|9|14|33.33%|\n|68|INTC|30.74|38.02|80.85%|41| |18|0.00%|\n|69|BKNG|3715.01|4192.39|88.61%| | | |#DIV/0!|\n|70|PGR|214.12|237.47|90.17%|19|5|4|26.32%|\n|71|C|64.88|71.01|91.37%|29|5|12|17.24%|\n|72|ELV|532.03|599.13|88.80%| | | |#DIV/0!|\n|73|BLK|876.5|936.85|93.56%|15|3|9|20.00%|\n|74|PLD|126.05|135.68|92.90%|18|4|8|22.22%|\n|75|LMT|541.92|535.31|101.23%|22|7| |31.82%|\n|76|ETN|304.79|345.86|88.13%|24|3|4|12.50%|\n|77|REGN|1079.19|1104.34|97.72%|26|7|6|26.92%|\n|78|MU|109.82|174.41|62.97%|31|8|20|25.81%|\n|79|CB|275.66|277.84|99.22%|19|5|11|26.32%|\n|80|SYK|327.45|378.81|86.44%|27|11|6|40.74%|\n|81|ADI|231.38|255.84|90.44%|26|6|10|23.08%|\n|82|LRCX|921.24|1041.75|88.43%|19|3|12|15.79%|\n|83|MMC|222.57|223.48|99.59%|19|4|7|21.05%|\n|84|BSX|73.88|87.57|84.37%|24|10|8|41.67%|\n|85|MDT|80.32|92.43|86.90%|23|4|7|17.39%|\n|86|BA|190.6|219.35|86.89%|25|7|7|28.00%|\n|87|ADP|262.62|264.65|99.23%|18|1|1|5.56%|\n|88|AMT|220.4|230.39|95.66%|22|7|14|31.82%|\n|89|PANW|324.73|343.43|94.55%|41|13|16|31.71%|\n|90|KLAC|823.07|868.07|94.82%|14|2|4|14.29%|\n|91|BX|142.15|135.47|104.93%|14|6|6|42.86%|\n|92|CI|348.67|393.25|88.66%|17|6|7|35.29%|\n|93|BMY|47.56|50.47|94.23%|22|5|4|22.73%|\n|94|GILD|76.06|81.02|93.88%|28|2|11|7.14%|\n|95|SCHW|65.19|73.89|88.23%|19|5|9|26.32%|\n|96|DE|371.98|422.99|87.94%|22|4|3|18.18%|\n|97|FI|163.57|177.14|92.34%|19|1|2|5.26%|\n|98|UPS|130.37|144.61|90.15%|26|3|2|11.54%|\n|99|SO|83.52|79.51|105.04%|17|1|4|5.88%|\n|100|TMUS|182.28|197.95|92.08%|30|7|16|23.33%|\n|101|COP|111.2|141.51|78.58%|21|6|9|28.57%|\n\n\nBased on this table above, I tried to identify some companies that met a few criteria.

This lead me to the following 11 companies:\n**Micron Technologies (MU), Boston Scientific (BSX), Abbot Laboratories (ABT), Merck Scientific (MRK), Stryker (SYK), The Cigna Group (CI), Broadcom (AVGO), Comcast (CMCSA), Honeywell International (HON), Analogue Devices (ADI), and Intuit Inc.

Okay enough with the fucking history lesson\u2026\n\nThe stock has been floating at around $1 USD after being around the $0.70 mark at the end of last month. So they are seeing some positive movement already in the last couple of weeks. This is just due to it being undervalued overall and a correction from what I can tell. \n\nAs of last week they finally broke above there SMA50 and are showing some signs of a recovery. This is good news for a longer look as they should be able to hold at this $1 mark and not need to deal with delisting.\n\nThey are expanding into new market and their finances are finally in order. Previously they had some problems with delivering EPS etc but they are now closing the gap on their burn rate and looking towards positivity. \n\nThe company while not selling a large volume of cars is under valued for the number of cars they sell at the current price point. TSLAs price per car is great than a 5X value while PSNY is less than 1/2X that. Okay I know TSLA is awesome so that\u2019s why the price per expect sales is so high\u2026 well LCID is at 2 1/2X and they haven\u2019t been doing so hot so once again this company is undervalued for what they are performing.\n\n\n\n\nTLDR stock seems undervalued and is cheap so buy stock and see go up",

    "selftext": "I was trying to figure out the reasons for the TSLA runup.  Saw many talking/writing about short squeeze, so-called analysts like Ives talking about robotaxi, others talking about energy, etc.   It's all over the place.  All trying to justify the crazy multiple expansion of this stock.  Most are convinced Tesla will achieve L3/L4/L5 autonomous classification to support robotaxi, as it has been sold to us.\n\nALL of them, I say again, ALL of them ignoring the fact that Tesla cars cannot achieve Level3 certification WITHOUT a backup system, such as LIDAR. Therefore, Tesla will never get L3 certified unless the US state motor vehicle regulators change the laws around this, and I highly doubt it will happen anytime soon. Equally I don't expect Tesla to start adding LIDAR since it would cut into their profit margin.  Assuming that by some miracle they actually achieve L3, L4/L5 is a huge leap forward and required for robotaxi.\n\nI genuinely believe there is corruption that persist here.  Much cheaper to bribe other people (or encourage fan boys) to spread lies throughout the internet about the future of tesla robotaxi fantasy.  I know I sound like a consipracist.  So, someone please explain to me what is wrong with everyone, including financial professionals, promoting this Tesla robotaxi lie?\n\nEDIT 1:  As I engage further on this topic, I saw this post referenced elsewhere.

Historical performance has been poor, they IPO'd way over valued to raise funds, but what they're doing is expensive. It's no news that they're hemorrhaging money, citing a loss of $40,000 per vehicle sold (down from $67,000 last year). But in the last 3 months they've had some very promising announcements.\n\nDuring the recent investor day webinar they talked about how Gen 1 was all about proof of concept, but now they're moving onto Gen 2 which is about manufacturing efficiency. They detailed how they reduced components, steps and fasteners to decrease production and assembly costs. It all sounds very good. In addition they just entered a deal with VW for $5 Billion and all Rivian is supplying to VW is software. It's a stepped plan, $1B up front and additional investments based on performance.\n\nIf they reduce manufacturing costs as they predict, and lower sale price as they promised, I'm thinking this stock could be ripe for big growth. They're the only company competing directly with Tesla, and on the consumer side, it's going well. I doubt we'll ever see a RIVN selling at comparable prices to TSLA, but I could see them over $100 in a few years if they continue to make advancements.\n\nThoughts?\n\nI'm in at $11/share.",

    "title": "Tesla reports 443,956 deliveries in second quarter, a 4.8% decrease from last year ",
    "selftext": "Tesla just posted its second-quarter vehicle production and deliveries numbers for 2024.\n\nHere are the key numbers:\n\nTotal deliveries Q2 2024: 443,956 vehicles\n\nTotal production Q2 2024: 410,831 vehicles\n\nTesla\u2019s numbers beat Wall Street estimates. Analysts expected Tesla deliveries to hit 439,000 in the three months ending June 30, according to a consensus of estimates compiled by FactSet Street Account. The total number of deliveries in the second quarter was down 4.8% from 466,140 a year earlier.\n\nTroy Teslike, an independent researcher widely followed by Tesla fans, predicted deliveries of 423,000 for the quarter.\n\nDeliveries are the closest approximation of sales disclosed by the electric vehicle maker. Tesla groups deliveries into two categories \u2014 Model 3 and Model Y vehicles, and all other vehicles \u2014 but doesn\u2019t report numbers for individual models or specific regions.\n\nTesla\u2019s current lineup includes its popular Model Y crossover utility vehicles, Model 3 sedans and the new Cybertruck pickups, as well as the Model X SUV and flagship Model S sedan.\n\nIn April, Tesla reported a drop of 8.5% in first-quarter deliveries to 386,810, the first annual decline since 2020. Weeks later the company reported 13% decline in year-over-year revenue for the quarter, \u201cprimarily due to lower average selling price.\u201d\n\nSluggish sales were in part the result of temporary factory shut downs initiated in response to an alleged arson attack at Tesla\u2019s factory in Germany, as well as shipping delays following Red Sea conflicts, Tesla said.\n\nBut the sales drop also correlated with Tesla\u2019s aging lineup of vehicles, increased competition from other EV makers especially in China, and brand erosion that one recent survey attributed partly to CEO Elon Musk\u2019s \u201cantics\u201d and \u201cpolitical rants.\u201d\n\nTesla shares are down 16% in 2024 even after rallying 6% on Monday.\n\nTesla has offered a range of discounts and other incentives this year to try spur sales.\n\nIn China, Tesla is currently offering a zero-interest loan as an incentive to get customers to buy a Model 3 or Model Y by July 31. According to its 2023 annual filing, Tesla generated about $21.75 billion of its overall revenue from China, representing 22.5% of total sales.\n\nColin Langan, an analyst at Wells Fargo, issued a report on Monday, saying the firm sees \u201cdeclining delivery growth driven by lower demand & diminished return on price cuts.\u201d He recommends selling Tesla shares.\n\nWells Fargo expects automotive gross margins at Tesla, not including environmental credits, to fall given the \u201clikelihood of more price cuts & lower volumes\u201d as the year continues.\n\nInvestor focus will now shift to Tesla\u2019s second-quarter earnings report later this month, and a separate marketing event planned for August, when the company intends to reveal its design for a dedicated robotaxi or \u201cCyberCab.\u201d\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/02/tesla-tsla-q2-2024-vehicle-delivery-and-production-numbers.html",

The educated estimates should be ranging from 415K to 420K, implying at least 9% YoY decline.\n\nRecall in January 2024's investor call that Mr. CEO was saying TSLA is between two major growth waves while no further guidance was provided (very tricky to be honest), does it mean \"low growth\" or actually \"no growth\"?\n\nMore information will be followed post the release of 2024Q2 numbers ...\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Tesla deliveries set to fall for second straight quarter**\n\n[https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/tesla-deliveries-set-fall-second-straight-quarter-2024-07-01](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/tesla-deliveries-set-fall-second-straight-quarter-2024-07-01)\n\n*Tesla's June-quarter deliveries likely fell 6%, the first time the top EV maker is set to post two straight quarters of decline, as it deals with stiff competition in China and slow demand due to a lack of affordable new models.*\n\n*The company is expected to deliver 438,019 vehicles for the April to June period, according to an average estimate based on forecasts from 12 analysts polled by LSEG, seven of whom slashed their expectations in the past three months.

    "selftext": "Tesla ( TSLA ) announced global vehicle deliveries for the second quarter on Tuesday, with total deliveries expected to fall short of current expectations. However, with demand for electric vehicles slowing in 2024 and the artificial intelligence boom dominating the market, perhaps Tesla's second-quarter energy storage numbers should also be cause for concern. The company deployed a record 4,053 megawatt-hours (MWh) of energy storage capacity in the first quarter. Tesla now offers solar panels and solar rooftops, as well as power walls for energy storage. On the commercial side, Tesla also offers a \"Super Battery Pack.\" Tesla's energy business may be \"uniquely positioned to benefit from the accelerating investment in the U.S. power grid driven by the AI boom\" as Generative Artificial Intelligence (Gen AI) increases energy demand. Tesla Energy is valued at $36 per share, or about $130 billion. Tesla Energy's revenue will reach about $7 billion this year, up 20% from 2023. Tesla Energy's profit margins will surpass the company's auto margins in 2024. So I think Tesla's energy business should be focused on as well, don't you think?",

    "title": "Trying to overhaul my IRA and taxable brokerage account with a focus on AI divestment",
    "selftext": "I\u2019m looking for a gut-check on a simple plan. I have an IRA (\\~$80k) and a taxable brokerage (\\~$267k) with Morgan Stanley. Both are managed accounts. Right now about 60% of the portfolio equity is effectively tied to big tech/AI (mag7). I\u2019d like to cut that concentration, move to a fund-only setup, and keep costs low. Also somewhat of a hedge towards AI bubble burst.\n\nTarget mix (household level)\n\n* 75% U.S. large cap\n   * 50% core (S&P 500 or total market: VOO/VTI or equivalents)\n   * 25% \u201ctop-7 light\u201d allocation to reduce reliance on AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, AMZN, NVDA, META, TSLA (leaning XMAG; open to RSP if that\u2019s cleaner)\n* 25% diversifiers\n   * 10% value (VTV or IWD)\n   * 5% mid cap (VO or IJH)\n   * 4% small cap (VB or IJR)\n   * 6% international (VXUS or IXUS)\n\nHow I\u2019d implement\n\n* IRA: start with XMAG only (no S&P/total market in IRA) to cut the mega-cap tilt fast with no tax hit. \n* Taxable: keep the S&P/total-market core (VOO/VTI) and systematically exit all single-stock positions, prioritizing the big tech names first. Do it tax-sensitively with about $10\u201315k per year in realized gains, have dividends go to cash to fund the new ETFs, and aim to finish in roughly three years.\n\nMy rationale for this vs just holding S&P 500?\n\n* Keeps broad U.S. exposure but dials down single-name risk.\n* XMAG (or equal-weight) helps with the current top-heavy market.\n* The diversifier slice is pretty boilerplate imo. \n\nQuestions:\n\n1. Does this combo (core + XMAG + value/mid/small/international) seem like a sensible way to cut big-tech exposure? Not a full divestment (though I'd like to - it's too risky of a bet), but a reduction in overexposure.\n2. For placement, would you park value/mid/small in the IRA and leave international in taxable for the foreign tax credit, or is that not worth optimizing?\n3. Is \\~$10\u201315k per year in realized gains and a \\~3-year glidepath a reasonable way to unwind single stocks in taxable?\n4. End stage I'd like to remove the \"managed\" signifier from these two accounts entirely. Has anyone had luck asking for a reduced brokerage fee or flat/retainer model for the advisors? How would you recommend I broach this full strategy with them?\n5. Should I deploy something similar with my 403b (if the available funds allow)?\n6. Anything else I'm missing?",

    "selftext": "Let me preface by saying everything below is for folks investing in individual stocks/trying to generate excess return and learn about markets - if you\u2019ve got a set it and forget it in index funds, that\u2019s the right call for most people and this post isn\u2019t for you.\n\nDecided to post again on moves I\u2019m making / have already made with my portfolio starting last week and extending for the next couple weeks through earnings. I\u2019ve gotten some positive feedback / requests from newer/younger investors to provide my investment perspectives, so posting this in the hopes it helps some folks build a mental model for how to think about markets and hopefully not to get run over (avoiding big losses is as, if not more important than making big gains in investing). I studied Classics as well as Economics in college, and am always reminded when investing of the importance of stoicism (or in market parlance, mean reversion). Things are almost never as good or as dire as they seem and knowing this influences how I think about markets and how I look to profit through changes in sentiment and market cycles.\n\nFirst, it\u2019s critical to understand this isn\u2019t a doomsday post but rather it\u2019s important as individual investors to understand market sentiment. In the words of Warren Buffet \u201cbe fearful when others are greedy.\u201d Not recommending anyone dump their whole portfolio tomorrow or enter a costly short position, but given we\u2019ve had a 26% run up in 3 months (and much more in certain AI stocks), it\u2019s time to start thinking about taking profits on positions that have materially run up and getting out of positions where valuations are insanely stretched (e.g, if you\u2019re in PLTR, TSLA, Cloud Flare, etc). I\u2019m personally exiting a number of positions and increasing my cash position to ~20-30%.\n\nPositions I\u2019m trimming/exiting:\nAMD (out)\nBTC (trimmed to <2% of portfolio)\nUber (waiting on earnings to trim/exit)\nDraft Kings (waiting on earnings to trim)\nCEG (out)\nGoogle (still very long, holding core position but selling my long-dated options over the next few weeks as we hopefully bleed up toward $200 post a very strong earnings quarter - was my single biggest position).\n\nSimple reasons behind this portfolio rebalancing:\n1. Several AI stocks I invested in back/before April have run up materially and now are a larger portion of my overall portfolio (increasing portfolio volatility and risk). Have to recognize many of these stocks are priced at or near perfection at this point. It wouldn\u2019t be shocking to see some air come out of this balloon in the short term, though I do believe in the longer term trend.\n2. September historically is the worst performing month for the S&P, coupled with the fact that we\u2019re starting to see peak euphoria tendencies (meme stock rallies, wild IPO rides, huge option bets by retail investors who have limited to no experience), spells for me time to reduce my risk.\n3. The market right now is priced for the rosiest of scenarios. It seems to believe the economy will remain resilient AND rates will be cut ~2 times this year. I think one of these is likely to be true, but these scenarios are likely to be mutually exclusive, I.e, economy stays resilient and Powell keeps rates steady or economy starts to falter and we see the cuts, either way we surprise to the downside vs expectations. The market is also heavily weighted to the AI trade and is now above 30x earnings (average is closer to 22x the past 30 years)\n4. I think the impacts of tariffs haven\u2019t played out in the economic data yet (there\u2019s a lag on these policies as they\u2019re enacted, enforced, and inventory clears) and wouldn\u2019t shock me to see some prints in the fall that start to rattle markets (given where we\u2019re at now from a historical P/E perspective it won\u2019t take much). I don\u2019t think it\u2019s Aug 1 that\u2019ll send us but some higher CPI / lower consumer spending/confidence prints in the early fall that spell weakening economy or rate cuts being off the table.\n\nThis is all to say, at a market level, we\u2019ve hit euphoria and I believe the balance of risk is now skewed to the down side. As a long-term investor, I\u2019m always long the market but to different degrees, but for all these reasons, I\u2019m trimming my nosebleed valuation stocks, adding to those with more reasonable valuations, and building a cash position. If we get a 5-10%+ dip (which I think is reasonable given the markets sensitivity to a 50 bps change in rate expectations), I\u2019ll start layering into select positions again. As always, these are my views, not investment advice. Good luck out there!\n",

Meanwhile they own the largest streaming platform in YouTube, and arguably the most actually successful robotaxi business in Waymo.

    "selftext": "I\u2019m just wondering what\u2019s the best practice here - for speculative investments (such as HOOD), would you put them in Roth IRA or a non-retirement brokerage account? Should Roth IRA just hold index funds for long-term growth or should it hold the more aggressive investments to take full advantage of the tax advantages? I find myself most actively managing my non-retirement account (because it\u2019s much bigger) and just letting my Roth IRA sit there with index funds like VTI and VOO, while I have stocks like HOOD, TSLA, BITO, etc in my non-retirement brokerage where I do more transactions there. Should I be doing the opposite? Like do index funds in non-retirement account and aggressive investments in Roth IRA?",

    "selftext": "The S&P 500 is THE benchmark used by just about everybody to determine if you\u2019re trading successfully or not. What I\u2019ve found is that if you want to beat the S&P 500, it might be a good idea to start with strong equities that are already beating the S&P 500.\n\nTo do that, we need to screen some stocks. This is how I build mine using TradingView's stock screener.\n\nFirst, these are the properties I look for in something I intend to spend money on:\n\n* **Liquidity**\u00a0\\- that means money being spent on an equity, i.e. trading volume.\n* **Room to move**\u00a0\\- no overhead resistance, and room to grow.\n* **Favorable trends**\u00a0\\- this is reflected in stable moving averages.\n* **Good short term signals**\u00a0\\- A good intraday chart, which can be analyzed using free indicators\n\n  \nHere are the specs:\n\n* **Market Cap 300M to 2B**\u00a0\\- Not too big, and not too small\n* **Perf 10Y > Perf 5Y**\u00a0\\- No long term dips in performance\n* **Perf 5Y > Perf 1Y**\u00a0\\- No short term dips in performance\n* **SMA(300) < Price**\u00a0\\- Price above moving average\n* **SMA(200) < Price**\u00a0\\- Price above moving average\u00a0\n* **Avg Volume 10D > 100K**\u00a0\\- No lightly traded stocks. Liquidity needed\n\nThis will get you a nice list of 20 to 50 stocks to scrub. But, for even more accuracy, I add the following filters:\n\n* **SMA(200) >= SMA(300)**\u00a0\\- Stacked long-term simple moving averages\n* **SMA(50 >= SMA(200)**\u00a0\\- Stacked mid-term simple moving averages\n* **ROE, Trailing 12 Months > 0%**\u00a0\\- Improving ROE (Return on Equity)\n\nAfter this, you have to use the charts.\n\n**Review the charts**\n\nVerify short term performance\n\n* [*Multi-VWAP \\[MW\\]*](https://www.tradingview.com/script/L8cxNVC7-Multi-VWAP-MW/?utm_source=tradingadvice.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=beating-the-s-p-500)\u00a0(1 hr Chart) - Above a rising 5-Day AVWAP\n* [*Magic Order Blocks \\[MW\\]*](https://www.tradingview.com/script/mC37KVoz-Magic-Order-Blocks-MW/&app_id=8750?utm_source=tradingadvice.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=beating-the-s-p-500)\u00a0(5 min Chart) - No major overhead resistance\n\nVerify fundamentals and long term performance\n\n* **ROE (Quarterly)**\u00a0\\- Rising ROE\n* **Float Shares Outstanding**\u00a0\\- Lower float means lower supply.

And, this one is skewed down, because I exited **$AEVA**, which ran up 79.3%.\n\nAnd some older positions from 5/22/2025. **Up 14.58%**. $SPY, now hitting all time highs, was **up 5.44%** on 7/22/2025.\n\n**$ATEN (+14.87%), $MVST (+1.47%), $LINC (+4.52%), $SEZL (+67.91%), $TMC (+46.84%), $TSLA (\u22127.44%), $SII (+21.11%), $PRRFF (\u22126.55%), $UTI (\u221210.37%), $TDUP (+6.53%), $LMB (+16.00%)**\n\nLast week I entered into 2 new positions, **$RBCAA** and **$MCRI**, which both, in addition to having strong charts and a rising ROE, have declining float, or fewer outstanding shares available. When supply is down and demand is strong that could be a good combination for price. Fingers crossed.\n\nThe other stocks on my shortlist that I didn't buy are already taking off: **$UNTY (+3.29%)** and **$AMSC (+8.92%)**. Maybe I'll add those later.\n\n",

While everyone's freaking out about the 53% EPS drop, I've been trying to make sense of why the stock is still up 37% over the same period. Either I'm missing something or the market is.\n\nMy position: 120 shares @ $187 average (up about 81% total)\n\nThe Q1 earnings were objectively bad\n\nEPS of $0.27 vs expected $0.41 (missed by 34%)\n\nFactory changeovers for Model Y killed production numbers\n\nAutomotive margins down to 19% from previous highs in the mid-20s\n\nMusk sounding increasingly distracted on the call\n\nYet I'm still holding and even added 15 shares on the post-earnings dip. Here's why:\n\nThe energy business is quietly becoming a monster\n\nWhile everyone obsesses over car deliveries, Tesla's energy storage business hit record gross profit with 26% margins. My brother works in commercial solar, and he says Megapack orders are backlogged for months. The margins here are substantially better than automotive, and it's growing faster.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mvjaujvsra3f1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=6d9767fdce67a01e648d7402b848268abf0ac86c\n\nSource: [https://knkresearchai.com/report/TSLA](https://knkresearchai.com/report/TSLA)\n\nThe robotaxi bet could pay off big\n\nI was skeptical about the robotaxi timeline until I saw the Austin test videos. If they actually launch paid rides next month as planned, it changes everything about the valuation model. Even if it's limited geographically, proving the technology works would be massive.\n\nOptimus robot could be the sleeper hit\n\nThe Optimus humanoid robot is another wild card that could transform Tesla's business model. They're planning to have thousands of units in production by year-end, ramping to potentially a million units annually by 2030. Imagine having one of these handling household chores, elder care, or factory work. The addressable market is potentially enormous if they can deliver even half of what they're promising.\n\nI've been wrong before, but...\n\nI sold half my position in 2022 thinking the Twitter acquisition would tank Tesla. Cost me about $40K in potential gains when it rebounded.

    "selftext": "/\\* posted in /stocks but was removed due to off-topic...\n\nIt is entertaining to read X recently. We have a lot of users calling for Fed to cut interest rates, in hope that the rate cut will push economic growth and reduce treasury yield. We have a lot of users calling for Fed to increase interest rate, so it makes USD more appealing and reduces treasury yield. Regardless, treasury yield keeps going up. The same story of basis trade and carry trade is playing again today.\n\nIt is debatable whether we want a stronger dollar or a weak dollar, but reducing treasury yield seems to be the common goal. How could we easily create more demands for U.S. treasury bonds, when both sides of the aisle embraces the deficit expansion to the core? Well, we can force people into buying treasury bonds, we can wage a war to scare people, or we can create some phantom demands. This is where the GENIUS act may come handy.\n\nThe grand scheme is to bring assets on-chain, which requires the players to escrow real-world-assets (RWAs) and issue tokens backed with it. Geez, this sounds like mortgage backed securities and ETF already. To trade those assets, we need currencies, mostly the stablecoins. The GENIUS Act requires holding of USD or treasury bonds, which the issuers will gladly support. Let us imagine that we move NYSE and NASDAQ on-chain and create a copy of all stocks, we suddenly create demand for USD, treasury, and stocks from some users that can't access the U.S. market. Even our dear general Kim can tornado his stash and buy Apple at that time.\n\nWait! This already happened! Kraken tokenized AAPL, NVDA and TSLA today. Many other crypto firms have worked on RWA for years, including stocks, game skins, etc. GAINS even created a 100x leveraged stock trading platform until they halted it due to heavy admin burden to monitor stock earning, dividends, splits, acquisitions, etc.\n\nSo we are likely to see a concerted effort to push assets on-chain in the coming months or years, which will benefit stocks like COIN, HOOD, XYZ, PYPL, and other players, and cryptos such as LINK. Electronic stablecoin payments for daily life is another direction, and I wonder how that will affect V and MA. The damage to both may take years though.\n\nToo bad I didn't scoop HOOD at low, but I bought all above anyway.",

    "title": "Financial professionals mostly aren't paid to care what happens to the S&P 500 the day after tomorrow",
    "selftext": "Container volumes at the port of Los Angels are down this week. They'll be down farther next week. We know this because arrivals are scheduled in advance and crossing the ocean by boat takes awhile. Container volumes at east coast ports are expected to do the same thing, but on a delayed schedule, because \"Shanghai, through the Panama Canal to New York City\" is a longer trip than \"Shanghai to Los Angels\".\n\nAnd because of *that*, it's a safe bet truckers will have trouble finding work next month. Large-scale retail layoffs seem likely to follow soon thereafter. Very little can be done to stop this, because even if the tariffs on China were lifted tomorrow, it takes 3-7 weeks to get merchandise from a Chinese port to an American retail store. (Plus, I feel pretty confident saying the tariffs on China won't be lifted any time soon.)\n\nA natural question when you hear this is, \"if that's true, why isn't the stock market down more?\" And I think a lot of the answer to this question can be summed up as: **hardly anyone is paid to care.**\n\nI was going to title this post \"financial professionals mostly aren't paid to care what happens to your index funds the day after tomorrow\", but the **index fund providers** *are* paid to care... in the sense that they are paid to care about minimizing tracking error. They are paid to make sure that when the index goes up X%, the fund captures those games, and when the index goes down Y%, the fund doesn't do any worse than that. But they aren't paid to know whether the index will be up or down tomorrow. And this is not a criticism! It's not their job.\n\nWho's job is it? For **high-frequency traders**, it's pretty much the opposite of their job. Their job is to do a trade and unwind it a few milliseconds later at a penny-per-share profit. And some of the hate HFTs get strikes me as overwrought; before HFTs were skimming a penny a share off every trade, floor traders were skimming 12\u00bd cents (because stock prices used to be quoted in eighths of a dollar). But HFTs definitely don't care about what's going to happen to the trucking industry next month.\n\nNow, despite what you may have heard, HFTs aren't the *entire* stock market. HFTs like to do small, quick trades. So instead, if somebody wants to sell half a million shares of TSLA, they might call around to various **dealers** and ask for quotes. The dealers will quote numbers below what an HFT would pay for *ten* shares of TSLA, but hopefully high enough that the seller agrees to the deal, and then the dealers will need to sell the stock to someone else, and that can't be done in a matter of milliseconds. Maybe they unwind their position over the course of 24 hours. So when the dealer gives a quote, they might be thinking about what the market could do tomorrow\u2014but they hope that by the day after tomorrow it will be somebody else's problem.\n\nOkay, but those are the middle-men. What about **professional stock-pickers**, active mutual fund managers, long-short hedge fund managers? Unfortunately, they also aren't paid to care what the S&P 500 will do the day after tomorrow. Managers of actively managed mutual funds care how they do compared to their benchmark, which is generally an index. If the index is down, that's fine, as long as *their* stocks are down less (or perhaps realistically, for risk-averse managers, aren't down significantly more). Meanwhile, a long-short hedge fund, which buys some stocks while shorting others, wants to be able to tell its investors that whether the broad market is up or down will have *no effect whatsoever* on the fund's performance.\n\nSo yes, actively managed mutual funds and long-short hedge funds are going to take a longer-term view of stocks they are thinking of buying or selling. And yes, they will care if companies could be affected by tariffs more than others. But even if they start to suspect *every* company should be down as a result of tariffs, they're not going to smash a big red button labeled \"sell everything\", because that's not their job.\n\nMaybe it's *somebody's* job to care, but honestly it's hard to come up with a good business model based around that sort of thing. If you realize a crash is coming, but get the timing wrong, you could lose a lot of money\u2014like if you went all-in shorting the market in 1999, when the dot-com bubble wouldn't burst until the following year. And if get the timing of *this* crash right because you bothered to look up how fast freight moves, how does that let you correctly time the next crash? It's not a lot to build a career on.\n\nHell, it's one thing to know about freight schedules, another thing to predict when the *market* will notice. It could crash tomorrow on bad first-quarter GDP numbers, or it might remain up until there are headlines about truckers unable to find work, or maybe it will take actual pictures of empty store shelves for the reality to sink in. And I certainly don't claim to know how badly the US will manage to drag the rest of the world economy down with it, which is why my money's in a mix of international stocks and international bonds, rather than simply one or the other.\n\nWhat I can tell you is this: unfortunately, you can't assume surely *somebody* would do something about it, if there were a totally predictable crash incoming. Nobody else has as much of a financial interest in what happens to your savings as you do. Act accordingly.",

    "selftext": "OK Reddit, I have been asked to synthesize a few ELI5 posts I made over the past week into an explainer, because folks found them helpful.  Believe me, it\u2019s an exciting action story, covering the fall of Randy Reliable, cutthroat geopolitical macroeconomics, and some face-punching.  And you\u2019ll learn why people in the know are worried. \n\n**TL;DR**: Bond yields aren\u2019t just a number \u2014 they\u2019re a signal of trust. And when the 10-year treasury starts rising during a market crash, it\u2019s not a good sign. It means the world is losing faith in the U.S. Here\u2019s why that\u2019s dangerous, what it says about our leadership, and how macroeconomic pressure is the new frontline in geopolitical power.\n\n## **Trade Wars and Tariffs, or, *How I Learned to Start Worrying and Watch the Bonds***\n\nOver the past two weeks, equity markets have plummeted in response to Trump\u2019s \u201cLiberation Day\u201d tariff announcement.  However, by the middle of last week, the 10-year treasury yield began to rise sharply overnight. Those in the know started to worry- a lot.  The following day, Trump significantly revised some of his tariff policy, citing bond market \u201cqueasiness.\" This brief primer is designed to help ordinary folks understand the basics and gain the macroeconomic literacy necessary to grasp these times, what may be happening, and why it is so concerning. \n\n## **What is a Treasury Bond?**\n\nImagine the U.S. government borrows money from people for 10 years and promises to pay them back with a little extra (interest). That \u201clittle extra\u201d is called the yield. A treasury is essentially that. It\u2019s an instrument through which the government borrows money and agrees to pay back more after a certain period of time.  So the 10-year treasury is a loan the government will repay in 10 years with a bit more.\n\nLet\u2019s say I buy a treasury for $10 and receive $11 back from the government over 10 years. That\u2019s a 10% return over its lifespan, or about 0.96% annually if compounded, but approximately 1% per year if simplified. We refer to that as a 1% yield.\n\nWhy does selling bonds cause prices to decrease? It's simple: supply and demand, just as selling stocks lowers their prices. When you suddenly sell a large quantity of anything, the price drops because supply exceeds demand.\n\nNow let\u2019s say I sell that bond for $8 because someone is dumping bonds and prices are falling. That bond still pays $11 over its life. So the person who buys it from me is getting a $3 gain on an $8 investment \u2014 or a 37.5% total return over 10 years. This translates to about a 3.2% annual return (compounded) \u2014 a big jump from the original 1% yield! \n\nAs you can see, when bond prices go down, yields go up \u2014 they move inversely.\n\nThis is worth emphasizing:  The U.S. always repays the same amount ($11) regardless of how much someone later buys the bond for on the secondary market ($8).\n\n- If the bond sells for $12 later, the U.S. pays back $11.\n\n- If the bond sells for $10 later, the U.S. pays $11.\n\n- If the bond sells for $8 later, the U.S. pays $11.\n\nThe reason the yield changes is not due to what the U.S. repays, but because the secondary market buyer paid a different amount for that return.   Making back $11 from a $12, $10, or $8 investment results in different profits, and thus different yields.\n\nWhy would someone sell a bond for $8 at a loss that is guaranteed to eventually pay $11 (in 10 years)?  Because they need the $8 now and don't want to wait 10 years for the bond to mature!  Or they might think they can get better than a 3.2% return by investing the money elsewhere.  Just as it makes sense for you to withdraw money from your bank account, even if it's guaranteed to earn you 2% interest, because you need to pay your rent or because you believe you can do better than 2% by YOLO-ing into 0-day TSLA puts.\n\n## **Why Should I Care About the 10-Year Treasury?**\n\nRemember my example where I sold my bond for $8, which caused the yield to rise to 3.2%? Now, when the government needs to borrow money again, it can\u2019t offer the previous 1% yield. Why? Because people can simply buy that 3.2% yielding bond on the open market. To stay competitive, the government must raise the interest rate on new bonds to satisfy market demands. As a result, it ends up paying more to borrow money.\n\nThink about it this way:  Imagine you\u2019re a builder in a town called Springville. For years, you\u2019ve successfully sold one-bathroom houses for $100,000. However, Springville has evolved. It's now a family-oriented town, and everyone wants two bathrooms. The one-bathroom homes you previously built are now selling for only $50,000 on the resale market, as buyers realize they will need to spend an additional $50,000 to add a second bathroom.\n\nHere\u2019s the issue: You can\u2019t continue building one-bathroom houses and expect to sell them for $100,000. Buyers won\u2019t be interested. Why would they, when the market values a one-bathroom home at $50,000?\n\nIf you want to maintain that $100,000 price tag, you\u2019ll need to provide more value, such as including the second bathroom from the beginning. The same applies to the U.S. Treasury. If it wishes to keep issuing debt, it has to match what the market currently provides. Otherwise, investors will simply look elsewhere.\n\nYou might say:  Well, so what? I don\u2019t care what the government pays in interest.  Not my problem!\n\n*Oh, it is very, very much your problem.*\n\nThis is because the 10-year treasury yield is a benchmark.  Many other loans (like mortgages, car loans, student loans, and business loans) key off of it.\n\nSo when the yield goes up, it means the U.S. government has to pay more to borrow \u2014 and so do you.\n\nHigher yields = higher interest rates across the board.\n\nThat\u2019s bad for:\n\n- **Homebuyers** \u2013 higher mortgage rates = higher monthly payments\n\n- **Businesses** \u2013 higher borrowing costs = harder to invest, hire, or expand\n\n- **The government** \u2013 more of the federal budget goes toward interest payments instead of programs like schools or infrastructure\n\n- **The stock market** \u2013 investors shift money out of stocks and into safe, high-yielding bonds, pushing stock prices down\n\nBasically, because so many interest rates are tied to the 10-year treasury yield, any increase in that yield raises the cost of capital for the entire economy. Getting money becomes more expensive. Business slows down. At the same time, stock prices drop.\n\nIt\u2019s a double whammy.\n\nThat\u2019s why people watch the health of the treasury market so closely \u2014 because it impacts nearly everything in the economy, even if you don\u2019t own a single bond yourself.\n\n## **Why is the 10-Year treasury such an important benchmark?**\n\nI want to say \u201cjust because\u201d \u2014 but that wouldn\u2019t satisfy you.\n\nIt\u2019s not that the 10-year treasury must be the benchmark, but it\u2019s the one everyone watches because it hits the sweet spot.\n\nTreasuries (so far) are considered \u201crisk-free.\u201d They\u2019re backed by the U.S. government and are super liquid. That liquidity and low risk provide the market a ton of real-time data about inflation expectations and the overall cost of capital. So they\u2019re a natural baseline for figuring out what riskier borrowing should cost.\n\nImagine you have a friend, Randy Reliable, who\u2019s always good for his money. Everyone is willing to loan him money at 2%. He borrows a lot, so there\u2019s plenty of data on what rate people charge him \u2014 and you can be confident that 2% is the right baseline.\n\nThen Sam Suspicious comes along and wants to borrow. You don\u2019t know exactly what to charge him, but since you know what Randy pays, you simply add a risk premium to that. That\u2019s how the market treats borrowers \u2014 it builds off the known \u201crisk-free\u201d rate.\n\nBut why the 10-year treasury specifically? It\u2019s not too short (like a 2-year) or too long (like a 30-year). It captures market expectations about inflation, economic growth, and Fed policy over a medium-to-long horizon, making it the go-to reference point for many long-term loans.\n\nMany countries have their own 10-year bond benchmarks, but Randy Reliable, the U.S. 10-year treasury, remains the gold standard globally.  In Europe, most euro-denominated contracts don\u2019t key off the U.S. treasury. Instead, the German 10-year Bund is the de facto benchmark; it\u2019s seen as the most stable and liquid bond in the Eurozone.  Other examples include:\n\n- UK 10-year Gilt \u2013 a common benchmark for domestic British rates.\n\n- Japanese 10-year  \u2013 used domestically, though heavily influenced by BOJ policy.\n\n- Chinese 10-year \u2013 also exists, but tends to be more policy-driven and less market-transparent.\n\nThese bonds exist and are useful, but their reliability and global relevance can vary, especially when markets perceive a government as unstable, opaque, or overly interventionist.\n\nThe US 10-year beats these because it checks all the boxes:\n\n- Deep liquidity\n\n- Transparent, market-based pricing\n\n- Long track record of stability\n\n- Dollar dominance \u2014 many contracts worldwide are USD-denominated\n\n- Safe-haven status during global crises\n\nWhen benchmarking global risk, Randy Reliable (aka the U.S. 10Y) remains the handsome, well-dressed guy with a good credit score.  If you benchmark against another country and it suddenly does something wild (Brexit, for example), you get burned. That\u2019s why predictability is essential \u2014 investors need confidence, not surprises.\n\n## **So It\u2019s Good to Be Randy Reliable?**\n\nYes, it is indeed good to be Randy Reliable. The dollar\u2019s position as the global reserve currency grants the U.S. considerable soft power. Countries often avoid financially attacking the U.S. as those actions tend to backfire on their own economies, making economic retaliation against the U.S. both risky and costly.  Additionally, high global demand for U.S. dollars keeps the dollar strong internationally, allowing Americans to purchase foreign goods more affordably.\n\nHowever, there\u2019s a downside:\n\nA strong dollar also makes American exports more expensive, which can hurt U.S. manufacturers selling abroad.\n\nThat\u2019s why undermining the dollar's status as a reserve currency is an unspoken (but nearly essential) goal of Trump's agenda, even if he is not fully aware of it.  Yet, it\u2019s a perilous strategy as it significantly weakens the U.S.  A good article discussing all this can be found here:  https://www.foreignaffairs.com/united-states/how-trump-could-dethrone-dollar.\n\n## **It All Comes Down to Trust and Predictability?**\n\nNow you\u2019re getting it.  The yield on the 10-year is seen as a key indicator of trust in the U.S. economy and its macroeconomic leadership.\n\nSo what if old Randy Reliable develops a ketamine habit and begins threatening his friends?  Well, suddenly he doesn\u2019t seem like such a safe person to lend to. \n\nThis is why the \u201clong part of the curve\u201d for treasuries (i.e., 10-year, 30-year) is often seen as an indicator of the financial health of the United States economy.  Are we Randy Reliable or Randy Reckless?  That\u2019s the question the world is asking right now, and it reflects in the yield curve. Add potential strategic bond selling pressure from China and other countries on top of that, and we have a problem.  I\u2019ll get to that in a bit.\n\n## **The Yield is the Entire Field**\n\nSo, putting it all together, the 10-year yield is a key barometer of the health and strength of the U.S. economy and the trust in American economic leadership.  As that trust erodes, folks see the U.S. as a riskier borrower.  So the rates they\u2019re comfortable charging to loan money to the U.S. go up. \n\nTypically, during periods of financial uncertainty, the yield on 10-year treasuries goes DOWN.  That\u2019s because long treasuries \u2013 lending to Randy Reliable \u2013 have always been regarded as a safe haven.  Remember, it represents the risk-free rate!  When equities (stocks) weaken, investors usually shift their money into that safe place.  More buyers lead to an increase in the value of treasuries. Because value and yield are inversely related, the 10-year yield declines.\n\nBut that\u2019s not what we saw last week!  Instead, while stock prices were falling, the 10-year yield was increasing.  That was\u2026 weird.  The markets no longer saw treasuries as their safe haven.  That\u2019s a scary thought.  It implied a market losing faith in the United States and concluding it was actually Randy Reckless. \n\n## **Wasn\u2019t I Supposed to Be Worried About an Inverted Yield Curve?**\n\nAren\u2019t higher long-term bond yields a good thing?  You may have heard that an inverted yield curve is a worrisome sign.  That\u2019s when long-term bonds have a lower yield than short-term bonds.  This situation is also anomalous because you would expect longer-term loans to have higher risk.  More time means a greater opportunity for the lender to default or for inflation to wreck you.  This higher risk typically leads to a higher rate of long-term bonds compared to short-term bonds. \n\nAn inverted yield curve is a signal.  It historically signals a recession and is worth monitoring.  Remember, when equities and other investments decline, we expect people to seek safety \u2013 like Randy Reliable \u2013 leading to a drop in 10-year yields. Therefore, while an inverted yield curve is concerning, it\u2019s still NORMAL. It remains just a signal, not a systemic risk in itself.\n\nRising 10-year yields during market weakness present a different type of danger: strategic selling by foreign holders or a decline in confidence in U.S. creditworthiness.\n\nThat\u2019s not a recession signal. That is the disease.\n\nThat\u2019s a sovereign confidence event.\n\nDifferent animal. Nastier teeth.\n\n## **What Does China, Japan, and Canada Have to do with This?**\n\nNow, China has almost $800 billion in treasuries (and they are also a big buyer, which creates demand). Japan holds even more \u2014 about $1 trillion.  Canada also has a sizeable holding. These can move markets.\n\nAnd remember, even if China holds only a small fraction of the total outstanding treasuries, what matters is the float \u2014 that is, how much is being bought and sold at any given time. For example, suppose typically 1% of the houses in your city are on sale at any time. Now, a real estate mogul decides to sell all of his houses, which make up 2% of the housing stock. That\u2019s a small fraction of all the homes in the city, but it triples the supply for sale. There aren\u2019t enough buyers for that. So, prices drop. A lot.\n\nEven though it\u2019s just a 2% change in total inventory, it\u2019s a huge disruption to normal market activity. Japan, China, and Canada can impact the treasury market in a similar way. If they sell a lot at once, particularly if others are selling treasuries too, there simply won\u2019t be enough buyers with cash ready, and that\u2019s what we refer to as a liquidity crunch or a low-liquidity situation. Since China is a major buyer of treasuries, it can also influence the demand side by halting its purchases.\n\n## **Bond Market Chess vs. Trade War Checkers**\n\nConversely, the increase in the 10-year yield last week may have resulted from major sovereign bondholders striking the United States right where it hurts.  They can engage in macroeconomic Bond Market Chess while Trump and the United States play Tariff Checkers.  And China, Japan, and Canada wouldn\u2019t even need to crash the market \u2014 just sell slowly and steadily, nudging the long end of the yield curve upward over time. This matches what we are witnessing now. That alone can quietly erode the U.S. economy. Think boiling frog.\n\nThe Chinese can then take the capital released from their treasury sales and reinvest it into their domestic economy \u2014 infrastructure, industrial policy, and innovation \u2014 effectively blunting the impact of a trade war. So, they\u2019re hitting the brakes on us while stepping on the gas at home.\n\nChina is smart enough to know this, and they have the tools to do it.  So are Canada and Japan.  Indeed, the current Canadian Prime Minister, Mark Carney, is one of the smartest macroeconomic thinkers out there.  \n\nThe dollar\u2019s status as the global reserve currency gives the U.S. immense advantages. But there\u2019s no such thing as a free lunch, and this kind of yield exposure is the price we pay for that privilege. As the saying goes, \u201cWith great power comes great responsibility.\u201d\n\nWhen the U.S. is strong, stable, and globally engaged, the financial pool is too deep for even China and other countries to make a splash. But if we start pulling back from the global economy, undermining our own institutions, and projecting unreliability, that\u2019s when the macroeconomic knives can come out and actually hurt us... a lot. This is particularly true if we, through belligerent economic policies,  encourage other Western or Western-aligned countries to collaborate against American interests.\n\nThis is exactly why people like me are warning that Trump\u2019s policies are not only misguided but also economically dangerous, fundamentally undermining American power.\n\n## **Can\u2019t the Fed Do Something?**\n\nYes and no, but not really.  Yes, the Fed can step in and buy long-term treasuries \u2014 that\u2019s what it did during previous rounds of Quantitative Easing (QE).\n\nBut there\u2019s a catch: it\u2019s much harder for the Fed to control the long end of the yield curve (10- and 30-year bonds) because those markets are massive and heavily influenced by investor sentiment regarding inflation, growth, and fiscal credibility.\n\nWhen the Fed buys bonds, it can lower yields. However, doing so aggressively on the long end could send a dangerous signal: that the Fed is suppressing risk in a manner that markets may not deem sustainable.\n\nIf the underlying issue is fiscal credibility, QE can backfire \u2014 driving up inflation fears and ultimately causing long-term yields to rise instead of fall.\n\nSo yes, the Fed can intervene, but doing so risks unmooring inflation expectations, weakening the dollar, and undermining confidence in treasury markets.\n\n## **So Why Not Just Make Those Chinese-Held Bonds Null and Void?**\n\nAfter reading this primer, many have suggested, why don\u2019t we just declare Chinese-held treasuries null and void? We have the power to take that leverage from them!\n\nNo, we do not have that power.  Do you want to crash the entire bond market and cause the US to default on its national debt?  Because that\u2019s how you do it.  This would be an economic catastrophe of the highest order and would make the Great Depression look like a mere blip.\n\nIt\u2019s as if someone is out there spreading rumors about your violent tendencies.  So, in retaliation, you publicly punch them in the face. Voiding China\u2019s notes makes about as much sense.  It simply proves exactly what the market was unsure about.    \n\nAs an example, suppose you, Charlie, Joan, Peter, and Mary each loan me $10,000.\n\nI decide I hate Peter and tell him I\u2019m not paying back his loan and that I won\u2019t repay it if he sells it to anyone else.  Peter\u2019s loan becomes worthless.  This situation is called a default. \n\nCharlie, Joan, and Mary all realize that I could easily default on their loans as well.  So, they panic and sell their loans as quickly as they can because now they don\u2019t trust me.\n\nThe value of the notes drops to zero or close to it because nobody trusts me to pay them back.\n\nNow, I go out to the market and ask for more loans.  Nobody wants to lend me money except at extortionate rates.\n\n## **What Can We Do?**\n\nUltimately, fixing this will require a great deal of time and rebuilding trust.  Unfortunately, trust is not something the Fed can print out of thin air, or that the President of the United States can enact through an Executive Order.  Trust comes from relationships and time.\n\nThere\u2019s an old adage:  Trust takes decades to build, a moment to lose, and forever to regain.  We are witnessing that in real time.  Restoring trust may well take decades now.  There will be no easy fix.  Hopefully, now that you understand the macroeconomic issues, you can begin the hard work ahead. \n\n*Open Source Note:*\n\nFeel free to copy, share, or adapt this post \u2014 with credit \u2014 for any non-profit, political, or educational use.

    "selftext": "We seem to be getting a lot of the same question recently about how to remove exposure of an index component if someone holds an index fund.\n\nWhether it's NVDIA because you think there's an AI bust coming. Or you don't want to own TSLA because of Musk - there are ways to remove exposure of a component in an index.\n\nFirst - the easiest way to do that is to not hold that fund and find a different fund that fits your criteria.\n\nBut if you want to hold certain types of indices such as large cap indices but you want to exclude a large cap component - it is a bit more difficult.\n\nThese are the different ways from most complicated to simplest.\n\n1. Roll synthetic short futures with equivalent negative delta.\n2. Write equivalent negative delta using deep otm call credit spreads or naked calls.\n3. Short the equivalent dollar amount of shares\n4. Roll long short puts or put debit spreads.\n5. If an inverse ETP exists, buy the dollar equivalent of the inverse ETP.\n6. Use a model-based replication service (usually only avail through an SMA/UMA program) which supports trade restrictions.\n7. Use a direct index solution which supports rebalancing. \n\nSome of these solutions require more trading effort and derivatives experience than the average investor. So unless you are familiar - don't do it. And it's not possible to use some of these techniques in retirement accounts.\n\nFor most investors - the simplest is #6 or #7. Many brokers offer direct indexing and/or managed accounts - for example:\n\nFidelity basket investing - [https://www.fidelity.com/direct-indexing/customized-investing/overview](https://www.fidelity.com/direct-indexing/customized-investing/overview)\n\nFidelity Fidfolios - [https://digital.fidelity.com/prgw/digital/msw/overview](https://digital.fidelity.com/prgw/digital/msw/overview)\n\nSchwab direct indexing - [https://www.schwab.com/direct-indexing](https://www.schwab.com/direct-indexing)\n\nSchwab stock slices - [https://www.schwab.com/fractional-shares-stock-slices](https://www.schwab.com/fractional-shares-stock-slices)\n\nThere are probably more ways - but these are the techniques of top of mind. And if anyone cares - I normally use technique #2.",

    "selftext": "Musk's empire appears to be built primarily on the value of Tesla stock which has a P/E ratio of about 140 vs the more common 7-ish range.  If Tesla was valued similarly to other car manufacturers, the stock price would be around $15/share instead of today's prices in the $285 range or a peak value of around $480.\n\nAnd part of that appears to be because Tesla continues to produce EVs even though they are not selling to get the carbon credits they then sell to other automakers.\n\nAll that said, he regularly [co-mingles assets](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/04/elon-musk-told-nvidia-to-ship-ai-chips-reserved-for-tesla-to-x-xai.html) and [personnel between projects](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/31/elon-musk-has-pulled-more-than-50-tesla-engineers-into-twitter.html).\n\nEven setting aside such items, since he uses the TSLA stock to leverage nearly all his other ventures, doing things like [buying Twitter and turning it into a more extremist site](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/social-media/elon-musk-x-twitter-antisemitism-hashtags-trending-hate-rcna151945) drove off advertisers, reduced the value of the purchased property, and both directly and indirectly harmed the value of TSLA by driving off both investors and consumers (generally, people who buy EVs are more likely to be left-leaning while the racists tend to prefer gas guzzlers).\n\nOn top of all this, he has a [history ](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/24/musks-twitter-has-been-sued-by-at-least-six-companies-for-unpaid-bills.html)of [not paying his bills](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/wiwynn-sues-elon-musks-xtwitter-over-unpaid-server-bills/#:~:text=Hyperscale%20server%20maker%20Wiwynn%20is,and%20is%20seeking%20%2461m).

I mean, when most companies spin off another entity, there's usually some sort of compensation, right?  Stock, payments, etc.",

    "selftext": "I\u2019m not a Tesla expert, and I\u2019m sure many of you have deeper insights into the company, but after watching the latest developments, I have some concerns that I wanted to share as a long time holder. Tesla\u2019s stock is sitting around $330 per share, up 75% from last year, but I\u2019m struggling to see how it justifies the current valuation.\n\nHere\u2019s a list of what bothers me:\n\n1. **Elon Musk\u2019s PR Nightmare** \u2013 It\u2019s hard to ignore how much Musk\u2019s public image has deteriorated. Between the \u201cSieg Heil\u201d incident on live TV and his controversial actions, he\u2019s lost a lot of credibility, and by extension, Tesla\u2019s brand has taken a serious hit. A lot of people now see him and the company as 'problematic'.\n\n1. **Competition Is Catching Up Fast** \u2013 Tesla used to be the only game in town when it came to EVs and FSD, but that\u2019s no longer the case. Other automakers are making significant strides in both areas, and some are already ahead in terms of technology and innovation.\n\n1. **Declining Profit Margins** \u2013 Tesla\u2019s profit margins have been shrinking year after year. This is concerning for a company that\u2019s valued at over a trillion dollars. If this trend continues, it could put a major dent in their long-term prospects.\n\n1. **The Cybertruck Disaster** \u2013 The Cybertruck was supposed to be Tesla\u2019s next big thing, but it\u2019s turned into more of a meme. The build quality issues and the general lack of progress on the product have made it a major disappointment, and it\u2019s starting to look like a marketing gimmick more than a groundbreaking vehicle.\n\n1. **Full Self-Driving Tech Overhyped** \u2013 Despite the constant chatter about robotaxis, Tesla\u2019s self-driving tech is still stuck at Level 2-3. Other companies have already rolled out Level 4 autonomous vehicles, making Tesla\u2019s claims look more like wishful thinking at this point.\n\n1. **Political and Tariff Risks** \u2013 Tesla\u2019s business is exposed to a number of external factors, from steel and aluminum tariffs to an anti-EV U.S. President. Plus, with a California governor who openly opposes Musk, there\u2019s a real risk of losing state EV incentives, which would hurt sales.\n\n1. **Raw Material Costs Are Rising** \u2013 Tesla is also facing increasing raw material costs, and tariffs on batteries imported from China could push those prices even higher. With profitability already under pressure, this is something that could really squeeze margins going forward.\n\n1. **Struggling to Attract AI Talent** \u2013 Tesla\u2019s ability to innovate in AI seems to be stalling. The company is having trouble attracting top AI talent, with many researchers opting to join OpenAI, Google, Amazon, and other big tech companies. This could set them back in the long run, especially as competitors accelerate their own AI developments.\n\n1. **Losing Support from Left-Leaning Consumers** \u2013 Tesla\u2019s alignment with Musk\u2019s political views has alienated many left-leaning consumers, who are typically more inclined to purchase EVs. This shift in consumer sentiment could hurt Tesla\u2019s market share, especially as alternatives to Tesla grow.\n\nI used to think of Tesla as the Nvidia of EVs, miles ahead of everyone else. But right now, it feels like they\u2019re slipping, with more and more companies closing the gap. Like probably lots of you (well, at least those on TikTok) I\u2019ve been using the trademind AI a lot recently, and that also has TSLA as a clear red flag to sell now. With all these issues piling up, I really struggle to see how Tesla maintains its $1.1 trillion valuation.\n\nWhat do you think? Am I missing something, or is Tesla headed for some rough times ahead?",

    "selftext": "As a newer investor I have started investing into big market cap stocks for the long term (AMZN, MSFT, GOOG) (AMD, SOFI riskier long term). However as I have noticed it has more emotional ups and downs, can be way more rewarding but also way more gutting. ETF\u2019s seems safer, less downside and way less emotion and time. However I understand that many choose stocks because it\u2019s more entertaining than an etf. But if my main goal was to have May 7 (minus TSLA & APPL), V/MA, SPGI, Uber, Nike, ASML, AMD, CRM, Sofi, what etf suits this best? (I know many will say choose MAGS but not many do, why is that? Aside from some wanting strict allocations in a couple and not all. Thanks for any info!",

    "title": "Uber: A Great Buying Opportunity In Current Markets",
    "selftext": "**Summary**\n\n* Uber\u2019s stock is currently undervalued due to market fears surrounding autonomous vehicles, but its robust fundamentals and durable business model make it a highly appealing investment.\n* Key strengths include an extensive urban mobility database, loyal user base, and diversified sources of revenue.\n* While the rise of self-driving technology presents certain risks, Uber\u2019s strategic alliances, regulatory challenges for competitors, and market dominance ensure it remains well-positioned for sustained growth.\n* Even cautious revenue and margin projections suggest considerable upside potential, making Uber an attractive choice with a strong margin of safety.\n\n**The Impact of Market Narratives on Uber's Perception**\n\nRecent announcements have reignited interest in autonomous driving. Tesla (TSLA) revealed plans to launch the Cybercab by 2027, while Google\u2019s Waymo (GOOGL) announced expansion into Miami. These updates have led to a nearly 10% drop in Uber\u2019s stock, contributing to a 15% decline over the past month.\n\nThis situation is reminiscent of past market narratives that impacted companies like Google and Meta (META). Both experienced temporary valuation drops due to overblown concerns but ultimately delivered strong returns, supported by solid fundamentals and competent management.\n\nUber continues to showcase impressive operational growth, strong cash flow, and consistent profitability, all while trading at historically low P/E multiples. These attributes, combined with its moat-driven business model, position Uber as a promising portfolio addition.\n\n**Uber's Competitive Moats and the Importance of Strategic Management**\n\nUber\u2019s advantages go beyond its network effects. Its unmatched urban mobility database allows for optimized routing, pricing, and seamless connections between users and drivers. Additionally, features like loyalty programs, subscriptions, and brand trust further enhance its competitive position in a sector where reliability and safety are crucial.\n\nDiversification is another critical element in reducing risk. Similar to Google\u2019s evolution beyond search, Uber has created a multifaceted platform that includes logistics and transportation. Delivery accounted for 30% of revenue in Q3, while freight contributed 11%, generating $1.3 billion despite not yet achieving positive EBITDA margins. These emerging segments have the potential to become significant revenue drivers in the future.\n\nFurthermore, Uber\u2019s investments in companies like Grab (GRAB) and DiDi (OTCPK:DIDIY) reflect a strategic approach to balancing profitability and competition. These equity stakes act as a form of optionality while demonstrating Uber\u2019s ability to focus on long-term gains in key regions.\n\nUber\u2019s management has shown remarkable capability in adapting to industry changes. Much like Meta\u2019s successful redirection of investments, Uber is already positioning itself for the adoption of autonomous vehicles. Partnerships with Waymo in Austin and Atlanta exemplify its ability to integrate self-driving technology while retaining its platform leadership.\n\n**Adapting to Regulations and Long-Term Mobility Trends**\n\nThe adoption of self-driving vehicles faces significant hurdles, including regulatory and infrastructure challenges, particularly in emerging markets that are critical to Uber\u2019s business. While major cities like Los Angeles and Miami may adopt autonomous technology sooner, broader implementation is likely to take years, especially in regions such as Brazil, India, and Mexico.\n\nIn addition, overarching trends in urban mobility\u2014including cost savings, easing traffic congestion, and the shift from ownership to access\u2014support Uber\u2019s long-term growth. Although the global ride-hailing market is already substantial, it remains underpenetrated in numerous regions, providing opportunities for continued expansion.\n\n**Uber's Resilience Shines Even in Pessimistic Scenarios**\n\nWhile autonomous vehicles pose potential risks, competition from local apps and evolving regulations may present more immediate challenges to Uber\u2019s margins and market share. Nonetheless, analysts project Uber\u2019s EPS to reach $4 by 2027 and $4.80 by 2028, resulting in P/E multiples of 15x and 12.8x, respectively.\n\nEven under conservative assumptions, Uber\u2019s revenue could exceed $74 billion by 2030, with margins reaching 11.5%. In a more optimistic outlook, margins of 17% would result in a P/E multiple around 10x, equating to an earnings yield of 10%\u2014a compelling figure for a leader in a growing market.\n\nUber\u2019s forward P/E and free-cash-flow multiples of 21.9x remain attractive given its growth trajectory and low current valuations. With management forecasting strong EBITDA growth and robust free-cash-flow conversion, Uber offers significant upside even if its market valuation remains steady.\n\n**TLDR:** Uber\u2019s long-term outlook remains favorable despite concerns over disruption from self-driving technology. Its diversified operations, strategic investments, and adaptability effectively mitigate potential risks. At its current valuation, Uber represents a strong investment opportunity with substantial potential for long-term shareholder returns.\n\n\n\n*Price at Publication:* **$61.13**\n\n  \n",

The difference is that new technology like AI can now spread faster than ever before and get used in new ways. Every new epoch uniquely benefits from the past, potentially bending the growth curve in new ways.\n\n>The other difference is that Nvidia has a monopoly position on the core technology driving this innovation. Therefore, the \\~350% run up over the last 12 months doesn\u2019t make NVIDIA the stock of the last year, but rather it\u2019s the stock of the next decade. The recent 3X gain will be a blip compared to what\u2019s coming thanks to NVIDIA\u2019s CUDA (moat), among\u00a0[other things](https://stratechery.com/2023/nvidia-on-the-mountaintop/).\u201d\n\n>\\- [1.5 year follow-up on buying the dip on pandemic stocks](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/17mzc07/15_year_followup_on_buying_the_dip_on_pandemic/), Nov. 2023\n\n# Nvidia's dominance\n\nI'm still working through my thoughts here, but my strong conviction around Nvidia comes in part from these observations:\n\n* Nvidia is\u00a0[founder-led](https://www.amazon.com/Nvidia-Way-Jensen-Huang-Making/dp/1324086718/)\u00a0and focuses on accelerated computing while remaining broad enough to allow for innovation and insight across industries where it can apply its core competencies.\n* It's unprecedented to have such dominance in such a fast-growing, valuable industry while maintaining such a long-term sustainable advantage.\n* This advantage is due to unreasonable investments (research, hardware, software, ecosystem, relationships) over decades, making it hard to copy.\n* AI will consistently make software\u00a0easier to create, thus reducing the moats of software companies and make them less attractive than hardware companies (for now).\n* Despite their impressive growth, Nvidia is still supply constrained, which is fundamentally easier to predict than demand constraints.\n\n# We still underestimate the AI opportunity\n\nMost importantly, we\u2019ve barely scratched the surface of AI\u2019s opportunities and benefits. Even the most ambitious targets underestimate it because the better and cheaper AI gets, the more use cases we'll find.\n\nWe have a habit of confusing the limits of our imagination with the limits of reality. Our imaginations are trained on what happened before, but there has never been anything like this before.\n\n# Final thoughts\n\nI'm still well within the '*maybe I'm just lucky*' phase since it's only been a couple years. Towards the end of [my last update](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1d758m7/2_year_followup_on_buying_the_dip_on_pandemic/)\u00a0I also shared a few ways my investment approach has changed, which I\u2019m still benefiting from.\n\nI expect my next update to be the 3-year update in mid 2025.\n\n**UPDATE:** Thanks for mentioning I should have included indexes for benchmark context. Indexes like QQQ and S&P 500 also had good returns during the same period (June 2022 - Dec 2024). For an apples to apples comparison, the IRR of QQQ and S&P 500 respectively during this period were \\~24% and \\~16%.",

    "title": "Investment Advice- Rebalancing?",
    "selftext": "I am looking for some advice on my current portfolio and savings plan.\n\nI'm a fairly recent immigrant to this country (36m) so started my retirement/ savings from scratch in my early 30's. Currently live in a very HCOL city on the west coast, making around 100-150k/ year running my own business as an S corp, where I pay myself a W2 salary thats roughly 60% of my income, which i adjust regularly to stay ahead of taxes. The nature of my work is project based and freelance so every month is different. This year I am paying myself approx 6k gross per month on w2. The remainder of the income from the business and other 1099 income I usually manage to write off completely as I invest it back into the business.\n\nMy main expense is rent and utilities, other than that I have no other debt (paid off car, no student debt) aside from small credit card bills (under 3k that I pay off monthly- no interest)\n\n  \n**Current Accounts and Savings:**\n\n  \nPersonal Checking Account- $3k, keep this empty for monthly expenses only. Zero interest. I view this as a pass through account- salary in, bills out.\n\nBusiness Checking Account- $20k, this account fluctuates a lot depending on cash flow, I usually try to keep it around $20k- thinking I could/ should move at least 50% into an account that accrues some interest. \n\nSEP IRA (Deductible)- 25k, I max out the contribution yearly, 25% of my w2 income (started this in 2022) I divide that total amount by 12 and make 12 monthly DCA buys into VTI. That's it. Could possibly just start dropping a lump sum?\n\nROTH IRA- 18k, Maxing this out every year. $500 monthly DCA buys into VTI (50%) VOO (40%) and 10% cash.\n\nM1 Investment Account- $3k, started this is March of this year to start putting some money into some individual stocks and slightly more speculative plays. $100 weekly DCA buys into a basket of stocks MSTR, TSLA, NVDA, AMZN, AAPL, V, LLY  etc. I like to own individual names and regular DCA just keeps the guesswork out.\n\nRegular Brokerage Account- $1.5k, use this for the occasional weekly/ monthly option contract. Any gains over 1.5k just get emptied into the ROTH. I regularly generate 400-500 per month from this account, so most months i don't even need to fund my ROTH from my personal account.\n\nChase Investment Account- $14k, $400 monthly contribtions, this was a Chase Auto Invest account (mid risk) that yielded about 10%, so below avg market returns. Chase has ended this auto investment service so the money is 80% invested into various funds but the new contributions will just be cash unless i Manually buy new funds. As this has been underperforming the market, i'm thinking about splitting this up over a few of my other accounts to streamline.\n\n  \nCrypto- $20k, been buying $100 of BTC weekly for years. Occasionally add bigger lumps on big dips. Will continue this DCA strategy.\n\n  \nSo my currently contributions to all my accounts are :\n\n  \nSEP IRA- 1k monthly DCA into VTI  \nROTH IRA- $500 monthly DCA into VTI/ VOO  \nM1- $400 monthly DCA into various QQQ type stocks  \nChase Invest- $400 monthly DCA into money market  \nCrypto- $400 DCA into BTC  \n\n\nI don't really ever sell stocks or funds, unless they become seriously overweight, or I need the cash, which hasn't happened so far.\n\nI'm fairly happy with the amount that I am able to save and invest monthly, just wondering if anyone had advice on how I could streamline this approach, or if there are other account types or assets I should consider. The monthly DCA strategy just works for me because it means I really don't worry too much about market movements, I actually prefer to see prices go down so i can buy more cheaper. \n\nTLDR: Please critique my current investment strategy, are there any other account types i should be contributing to regularly to build wealth for the future and how could i manage my regular buys/ DCA/ contributions more effectively?",

    "selftext": "Hi investment friends, starting with the point of this analysis: Tesla, is a Wrigley's or a Coca Cola or our era but with a beyond imagining more future potential. \n\nWarren Buffett's although we love him, he's one of the top 7 wisest who ever lived and has the motto \"invest in things you understand\" (it should be added that there should at least be ample time to get to understand it coz' most are very much understandable or it's just pride to stick to simple to manufacturer but en masse consumables and the like as I call his favorites, assets like gum, candy, airlines and softdrinks which are everywhere and all customers are repeat customers) but there's still that constant, that he's not infallible. What it means to 'understand' has to be truly be analyzed way deeply than ever before.\n\nAs most have said in the tech industry, sir Warren's fundamental which includes that it's highly speculative (also it's not on the record but it implies he's not into Elon Musk's kind of personality which for him is unpredictable but that's another miss in the fundamental analysis of the one who leads Tesla) analysis of Tesla appears not to be fundamental at all coz' it's most likely incomplete. As most have said Tesla is not just a car company, it's not just a products company selling cars. What was once speculative and beyond the norm have materialized, an example is EV cars that are practical compared to EVs from generations past, now you have the many Models of Tesla. Elon Musk w/ Tesla has proof that they can execute what seems to be many as speculative (although I don't agree with him 100%, especially when it comes to 100% autonomy, coz' technology is buy a tool for mankind and will always babysit any technology).\n\nTesla is not just a car company, it's more than that- its an energy company (generating revenues energy services like charging and at the same time it \"ate it's own cake too\" as they say, it creates the products, the batteries to facilities that energy charging service), it's an A.I. company, solar energy company and a robotics company which is still at a speculation stage wether people will buy that but given Tesla w/ Elon's leadership, there's a high probability that Optimus will be practically used almost everywhere (just like again, EV as practical long range modes of transportation was a pipe dream until they launched en masse the Model S and the Models after that).\n\nThank you for reading.\n\nGod bless us Signal vs. Noise Investor Masterace (that's all of the good folks on r/Investing)",

But we have to define consumable, it doesn't have to stop with one person, it can go on to almost forever with the next generations.\n\nHaving said that could TSLA be the era for this generation and generations close to it: it's en masse, everybody needs to commute, driving's one's self is convenient, it's consumable in a way coz' you replace things like parts and the vehicle eventually (also energy is bought from Tesla via the superchargers among other things) and there's always new graduates to buy them, 3rd they are not simple to make compared to a gum but technology may have made up for that as it's as simple or close to the simplicity of making a gum (automation + now w/ A.I.), 4th it does require constant R and D but then again technology compensates for that as if there's not much further R and D (especially with A.I. helping with a vehicle's physics and material science).\n\nThank you for reading.\n\n  \nGod bless Signal vs. Noise",

    "selftext": "hey all, sharing what i'm calling my \"frontier tech\" portfolio, broken down by percentages. i'm looking for valuable input, feedback, and discussion around it. and, if it happens to be helpful to anyone, even better. i do want to clarify a few things:\n\n* i'm focused on AI, bitcoin, and space. investment vehicles or not, i simply think each are tech frontiers that hold tons of promise, are poised for massive growth, and will bring immense amounts of value to the world over the next few decades. let's just call this a \"frontier tech\" portfolio, to give it a name i can reference.\n* i'm not looking for feedback that just disagrees with that thesis. whether you think AI is all hype, or you are anti-Bitcoin and think it's a ponzi scheme, or you think space is a waste of resources, or anything along these lines - that's ok, i respect that perspective, but i'd like to avoid arguing about it. we just disagree about some fundamental things, and you won't convince me i'm simply wrong.\n* i AM looking for feedback on blind spots, poor/missing assumptions, overconfidence, things i'm not considering, or any other constructive input that falls within the framework of the overall thesis. i'm not just looking for people to agree with me (though that is interesting input as well) - i just want feedback that can be applied within my overall investing philosophy.\n* yes, i'm missing some key areas of what many would call \"frontier tech\" - biotech, green / nuclear energy, cybersecurity, to name a few - but i just don't have the same level of confidence in specific areas of those. i prefer to stay relatively focused on the categories where i'm most confident and able to stay up to date.\n* i'm trying to keep my language somewhat appealing to a wide audience. not looking to get too bogged down in technical details or language that would alienate someone reading this stuff who's less familiar with one or any of the spaces/categories.\n* my primary goal is a portfolio of funds and stocks that i can invest in with *strong long-term confidence in growth.* not stuff i trade frequently. and not stuff i love the idea of or that seems interesting / sexy but that i don't know enough about (SMCI, PLTR, altcoins as some good examples). i also generally prefer companies whose leadership i trust and/or admire.\n\nok, with that out of the way, let's dive in:\n\n**30% AI** - 10% NVDA, 5% SOXQ, 15% balanced mixed of NOW, MSFT, AAPL, GOOGL, META, AMZN\n\n* HIGH LEVEL: to me, this category is ABSOLUTELY going to change our world in fundamental ways over the next several decades. AI's potential is not chatGPT, or smarter versions of it. it's far beyond what we're seeing from LLMs today. if you listen to the engineers and operational leaders within the AI space, listen to not what they \"believe\" is gonna happen, but to what they know is coming because they've already used the tech, usually 1-2 years before the public even sees it, these people are overwhelmed, amazed, terrified, enchanted, bewildered. to me, that's just very interesting. i believe what some others do - that we're in the midst or on the verge of another technological revolution. i'm not bothered much that AI isn't monetizing in demonstrable, repeatable ways. i think there's been and continues to be enough fundamental, increasing advancement in this field that the value creation will absolutely surpass what most people think. as for the individual stocks, i'll do a quick dive here. to be clear, I don't think these are groundbreaking choices and many are very obvious. but, seems useful to give my favorite things about each:\n* 10% NVDA - these guys are and will continue to be at the center of the whole thing. their moat is extensive. it's not just GPU / blackwell demand. it's their CUDA programming language and universe, and stickiness of it. it's the long-term horizon required for their data centers that makes 5-10 year customers out of everyone who buys their stuff. it's CEO jensen pushing them and already looking for the \"next big thing.\" just a lot of confidence here.\n* 5% SOXQ - i like this semiconductor ETF a little more than SMH because it's more diverse (SMH is like 25% NVDA, which is great if i didn't already allocate so much there), and it's got a low expense ratio (0.19%). i love this exposure because the AI industry is driven by these companies (e.g. TSMC, Micron, Broadcam, Qualcomm, AMD, AMAT).\n* 15% mix of these...\n   * NOW - excellent leadership and integrated heavily with NVDA tech; will benefit hugely from AI boom with AI-driven automation\n   * META - founder-run and with a clear vision; demonstrating enormous resources and focus on building AI models, meeting consumer needs, being pioneers in tech at large\n   * AAPL - will probably benefit the most from consumer-facing AI products and implementation; strong leadership\n   * AMZN - AWS is a profit monster that will be huge for AI tools and services and data centers; logistics and ecom will be big AI beneficiaries; strong leadership\n   * MSFT - deeply embedded in the AI revolution with its investment in OpenAI + AI integration into Azure and Microsoft 365; excellent leadership\n   * GOOGL - AI pioneer with DeepMind / Brain; they still own search; have enormous amount of data; questionable leadership but I'm holding for now\n* No TSLA??? no. i just don't trust elon musk enough at this point. and i need confidence in a company's leadership for me to invest in its stock. there's a big chance i'm missing out (their robotics division might be incredible), but I'm able to sleep OK with that.\n* i'm also missing plenty of other AI picks. i know that. these are the ones i can invest in with the most confidence.\n\n**30% Bitcoin** - 25% Bitcoin itself (cold storage or an ETF), 5% MSTR\n\n* HIGH LEVEL: why Bitcoin? books have been written about it, but to shortly summarize my perspective - it's quite volatile and risky short-term, and quite growth-oriented and (thus far) safe long-term. excellent store of value. wonderful technology, math/code based, and may or may not upend some portion of the financial system. limited supply that's only decreasing over time. immutable. now adopted by many big institutions. goes on giant bull runs every 4 or so years. some days, it's hard to justify NOT putting more into this one, but for now i'm convinced that\u00a0 diversification is the better long-term play.\n* 20% Bitcoin - many would argue that holding actual Bitcoin, ideally off exchanges and on cold storage is the smartest play here. but there are also arguments for FBTC or IBIT (helpful in tax-advantaged accounts; trusting an ETF seems safer to some - very debatable). i do some cold storage, and some FBTC (they self-custody their Bitcoin, which not everyone does). either way, just Bitcoin. it's the only crypto play where my confidence level is very high.\n* 5% MSTR - this is a leveraged Bitcoin play. strong chance it outpaces BTC growth rate during bull runs. i may shift some MSTR profits to Bitcoin over time if it starts to really offset my 4:1 BTC:MSTR ratio.\n\n**30% Space** - 10% ASTS, 10% RKLB, 5% LUNR\n\n* HIGH LEVEL: the tech for space finally seems to match the potential that's been talked about for decades and decades. for a while, space-x really proved this out, almost single-handedly. but we clearly have some strong other players either in or entering the category. my favorites are these three. here's why:\n* 10% ASTS - you should read the kook report (google it) for a true deep dive, but to hit my high level points: they are pre-revenue but with the potential for MASSIVE growth. effectively, their satellite system aims to offer a global cellular network. think starlink but more b2b and generally better tech. they own tons of patents. they are 5+ years ahead of what many think will be a winner-takes-most race. their partners already include AT&T, Verizon, Vodafone, Rakuten, American Tower, Bell Canada, and more. they have excellent leadership. i find this a risky-ish play as they have tons to still accomplish, but the potential growth is enormous.\n* 10% RKLB - effectively, a space-x competitor on smaller rockets, with a fraction of the market cap and a huge runway for growth. i think still heavily undervalued today. nerdy/awesome leadership. vertically integrated. as telecom, defense, and general research spending expands to space economy, RKLB is positioned very, very well.\n* 5% LUNR - i've spent less time researching them than the other two, but my confidence level in the risk/reward is still pretty high. key player in the lunar economy - one of few companies that can deliver payloads to the moon. very niche but valuable moat. huge potential, good amount of risks ahead.\n\n**10% cash** - ...to buy them juicy dips.\n\nok, that's my \"frontier tech\" portfolio summary. to repeat - this is what i can confidently invest in for what i believe will be better-than-average returns over the next 10+ years. i recognize that this discussion didn't even really touch share price, EPS, P/E, profitability, revenue, or other key details. this just isn't the place where i'm getting into that. i can say that i'm comfortable with the financial metrics and details regarding these companies. but this discussion is mainly focused on what categories i think are poised for the most growth, and what companies/stocks/assets in those categories seem to be most positioned to lead that growth. thanks for reading.\n\n*\\*\\*\\*The information provided is for educational and informational purposes only and should not be considered financial advice.

    "selftext": "I posted a couple weeks ago seeking some advice on a 3 fund portfolio and bonds [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1elrna2/3_fund_portfolio_bond_advice/).  Got lots of great feedback, and now that I have digested it all - I'm looking to move on some of it and hoping for some followup great advice on how to best handle.  The gist of it was:\n\n  \n*$5M portfolio, heavily weighted in AAPL and TSLA (80%) with $1M cash. Commenters suggest diversifying into index funds or bond funds, considering the tax implications of selling stocks, and caution against over-reliance on Schwab Intelligent Portfolios due to its high cash allocation. Some recommend exploring municipal bonds for tax efficiency and using a more conservative investment strategy given my financial situation.*\n\nWhat I've started the process of doing is moving some of the cash to VOO, VXUS and VXF at a 50/25/25 split.  I feel confident with that mix and my goal of turning this $5M into $10M in \\~10 years seems possible.  That just leaves the stocks and figuring out how to best convert those over into the 3 funds.  Am I right in assuming that there is really no real trick to this other than to sale them at the rate of taxes I'm willing to incur each year?  Much of the AAPL and TSLA holdings are profit so they are gonna hit me the hardest.  If I'm right in that assumption - what not just pull the bandaid off and do them all now?  Is there any real benefit to doing them over several years?  I don't plan on selling everything, but do want to move the bulk of stuff to those 3 funds.",

I will sell them before year end along with another dog stock I have held for too long for a combined loss of $40K. \n\nMost discussions of tax loss or capital gains harvesting would be concerned with what I do with the cash from that sale, but I have a different question. I have NVDA shares which have appreciated $40K, and I have held them for more than a year. Does it make sense to take my profit now in order to have a net-zero transaction? Is this a mechanism for taking my profit in NVDA without owing additional taxes as if I sold it in retirement?",

    "title": "3 Fund Portfolio / Bond Advice",
    "selftext": "I'm 44 years old and have about $5M in my Schwab accounts. Around $1M is in SNAXX money market, taking advantage of the high interest rates, and the rest is in stocks and mutual funds. My largest holdings are in AAPL and TSLA, accounting for about $3M.\n\nI spoke with my adviser at Schwab today because I'm ready to redirect my monthly SIMPLE IRA contributions (\\~$2666/month for my wife and me) from buying stocks to something else. He suggested the Schwab Intelligent Portfolio, which seems like a good fit. I've also been reading about the 3-fund portfolio.\n\nSo, with all that in mind, I have a few questions:\n\n1. **Feedback on SIP vs. 3-fund portfolio?**\u00a0If I go with the 3-fund portfolio, should I stick with the Schwab options listed on the Bogleheads wiki, or is there a better way to choose the funds?\n2. **Advice on moving $500K from SNAXX to bonds:**\u00a0I'm ready to move half of the $1M in SNAXX to bonds in preparation for interest rates coming down, so I can lock in some good returns for the next 5 years. Any recommendations on what I should consider buying?\n\nI've done well so far by just buying stocks, but this is a bit out of my expertise, so I would love some guidance. Thanks!",

    "title": "Analyzing the Analysts: Using average analyst price target to identify possible buying opportunities amongst the top 100 companies in the S&P",
    "selftext": "Hello everyone,\n\nI'm a lazy investor and don't like to do much due diligence, but I do like to make money. Unfortunately these two things about me are often at odds as I've lost money in the past for not doing my DD. As such, I continue to be lazy but I try and find ways to work around doing due diligence and hopefully finding loop holes.\n\nOne such way that I have been thinking about recently is using analyst ratings, reviews and price targets as a surrogate for due diligence. In essence, I try to just have these analysts do the work for me. An idea I had is that much in the same way that with those who believe in technical analysis hold that everything you need to know about a stock is baked into it's price action, and so when something good happens the stock price goes up and when something bad happens the stock price goes down, thus all you need is to analyze trends in stock price and you'll be analyzing everything about the stock by proxy, I have a thesis (or theory) that perhaps you can do the same or something similar with analyst price targets of companies.\n\nNow I know that anyone who has read this far, already thinks I'm an idiot. Many experienced individual investors probably find market analysts to be stupid and therefor I'm stupid for following their lead, but I would argue to the contrary for a few reasons. As much as I have put in a lot of effort to learn about how the market operates (been investing for the last 6 years, started learning actively about it as much as I could a couple years prior to that), there is still much I don't know as I don't have a finance or economics degree. Moreover, as bad as you may think an analyst is, they are at least competent enough to keep their job as an analyst at the investment firm that allows them to make stock price target selections. Lastly, and most importantly, what I am about to discuss below uses the aggregate of several analyst price targets so I'm not relying on a single analyst but several (probably between 10 and 40 per company). I think if two-dozen analysts are strongly in favor of a company, it is unlikely that my novice investor wisdom would have researched the company and found a flaw that they all missed.\n\nSo what I did yesterday evening was go through the top 100 S&P 500 companies by market cap and find the current average price target for them on Yahoo Finance. I then divided the current stock price (at the close on 7/31) by that price target and expressed it as a percentage to see how far off the company was from the average price target analysts were aiming for.

on this table above, I tried to identify some companies that met a few criteria. I wanted to identify companies that had at least 25% of their analyst ratings be 'Strong Buys', to have at least 20 analyst ratings available and for the current stock price to be at 90% or less of the average price target. This lead me to the following 11 companies:\nMicron Technologies (MU), Boston Scientific (BSX), Abbot Laboratories (ABT), Merck Scientific (MRK), Stryker (SYK), The Cigna Group (CI), Broadcom (AVGO), Comcast (CMCSA), Honeywell International (HON), Analogue Devices (ADI), and Intuit Inc. (INTU)\n\nI have about $5,000 I'd like to invest right now and I have half a mind to just put it equally weighted into these 11 companies and just watch it for the next year or two. I'll either do that or put it all in VOO, but I have a feeling that these 11 companies might beat the S&P 500 over the next 24 months.\n\nWhat do you guys think?",

    "selftext": "Hello all, I am very confused on how to proceed from the position I am in, and so would really really appreciate some advice. I am 19 years old.\n\nFirstly, for some background, I started trading maybe back in 2022, I put in about $2500 in a WeBull trading account and invested in a bunch of big names like AAPL, TSLA, LMT, etc. And I invested some money into some complete no name stocks that I saw on TikTok. By what I would imagine to be completely luck, these stocks actually did quite well and they have been in the green for some time now. But yes, I know not to take advice from TikTok lol.\n\nFast forward to now, I havent touched the account since then, and opening it I have made a return of about 16% with about $400 in total open P&L. Which I feel like is good? maybe? I don't know.\n\nAnyways the reason I'm making this post is because I'm interested in short term profits, I have always wanted to get into options but to be honest it just seemed very tricky and like gambling, and so it's always been a \"I'll learn how to get into it later\", but a few days ago I heard about something called futures trading and it seems much more simple and I would like to get into it. I have a very superficial understanding of how it works, and so I was just hoping to ask a couple questions about it:\n\n1. Should I trade futures through a prop firm? Especially if I am just starting out/don't have a trading strategy? Or would I be better off starting with micros & my own money?\n2. On that note, how do I go about developing a trade strategy? Do I just watch a YT video on different strategies available and pick one? My friend told me all strategies will work if I just use discretion but tbh that just made me more confused lol\n3. What should I\u00a0use\u00a0to trade futures? I have heard that Ninjatrader is good.\n\nAnd the next topic comes to my Roth IRA through Fidelity. over the course of a few months back in 2022 I put $200 in it monthly and eventually stopped, mainly because I was confused what ETFs I should put my money in.\n\nPeople have told me VOO > SPY, but then some others said $FXAIX > $VOO. Which, if any, is true? Should I invest in all 3? Also, is $200 a month enough? Should I aim to max for $6500 contributed annually? Does it really matter?\n\nI realize this post is all over the place and I apologize, but it's all the more reason I would appreciate some answers and so that I know where to go moving forward. Thank you very much!!!!",

    "selftext": "\nWhether NVDA is overvalued or not is up for debate, I have been hearing on Youtube that NVDA will drop after stock split just like TSLA did.  Let\u2019s look into some figures for comparison:\n\nregarding NVDA, the current market capitalization as of June 2024 is around $3T. This valuation makes NVIDIA one of the most valuable companies in the world by market cap, even higher than the peak valuation of over $1 trillion for TSLA.\n\nIn October 2021, TSLA PE ratio was quite high, reflecting its growth expectations and market enthusiasm. The PE ratio was around 250.96 at the end of September 20211, and it likely remained in a similar range throughout October. The forward PE ratio, which is based on projected earnings, was also elevated, indicative of the optimism about the company's future performance.\n\nAs for NVIDIA, as of today, the current PE ratio is approximately 77.182.

Insight\u00a0\n2. Conviction\u00a0\n3. Patience\n\n**Insight**\n\nI\u2019ve learned to largely ignore headlines and talking heads, which seem more reactionary than insightful and optimizing for entertainment (clicks/views).\u00a0\n\nBen Graham\u2019s quote rings true:\u00a0\n\n>\u201cIn the short run, the market is a voting machine but in the long run, it is a weighing machine.\u201d\n\nPerhaps counterintuitively, I\u2019ve found it more useful to read/listen to tech/business analysts who focus on strategy and how that interacts with macro trends (along with financials) than solely financial analysts and stock pickers.\u00a0\n\nFinancials are a good indicator of fundamentals, but are backward-looking. However, valuation is forward-looking, thus driven by strategy x trends x structural advantages, so we must consider both.\u00a0\n\n# Math\n\nIn 2023 I also started\u00a0practicing math daily\u00a0(243 days straight\u00a0as of this morning) in order to better understand the mathematics behind AI. As part of that, I had to take remedial coursework to build my foundations since it had been so long since I\u2019d done any meaningful math.\u00a0\n\nI\u2019m not sure how much, but it\u00a0*feels*\u00a0like it helped with the reallocation decisions I made in late 2023 and early 2024. I felt more confident and deliberate in making trades. The math journey has been quite challenging, but personally rewarding, whether it has helped or not.\u00a0\n\n**Conviction**\n\nA big part of this is just a better understanding of myself and what kind of investor I am. I invest in what I believe in long-term.\u00a0\n\nHowever, someone trading on volatility with a much shorter timeline may not care about conviction. You must understand what investment philosophy aligns with your psychology and your strengths.\u00a0\n\nConviction investing works for me because, even when building products (my day job), I\u2019ve always been strong with product vision/strategy and always building for the future, so it makes sense that I invest the same way. I\u2019m not sure why it took me so long to connect those dots, but I\u2019m happy I did.\u00a0\n\nA big part of this is also timing. AI seems to be a once-in-a-generation opportunity. Whereas 5 years ago I might have tried to force myself to believe crypto was the next big thing in the absence of anything substantial.\u00a0\n\nThis is another reminder that success (in investing or otherwise) is all about timing and opportunity. When opportunities arise,\u00a0you must seize them.\n\n**Patience**\n\nAs a result of my convictions, I\u2019m much more patient in my investing these days and don\u2019t react to the day-to-day.\u00a0\n\nI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if I don\u2019t make another trade for the rest of 2024.\n\n**UPDATE:**\n\nA commenter asked about benchmarks, which I failed to include since I don't pay attention to them, so I had to look it up:\n\nI opened my portfolio in June 2022. Since then the cumulative S&P return is \\~28% (\\~39% for Nasdaq). My cumulative return for that same period is around \\~215%. The annual rate of return (per my Vanguard dashboard) is 77.9% as mentioned in the original post. I would expect my returns to revert to the mean over time.",

    "title": "10 years ago, we discussed how we select stocks. Here's the 2024 version.",
    "selftext": "Hi /r/investing, roughly 10 years ago there was a great discussion about [how we select our stocks](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1ecl4v/how_do_you_search_and_find_good_stocks/).  I discussed my method - Trending Value - and that led to me sharing my results with many of you via a program I had written.  Well, that program broke and remained dormant for years... until now.\n\nSo what is Trending Value?  It's a method published by James O'Shaughnessey in his \"What Works on Wall Street\" book. During decades of backtesting, it generated over 21% annual returns with equal standard deviation to the total market.  It generated a lot of discussion and lead to [this follow-up thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1eyx3r/how_do_you_select_stocks_contd_trending_value_see/). In my mind, this method resonates the truest... far truer than those who advocate watching the check-out lines at your grocery store to see which products are being purchased. The method, summarizing is the following:\n\nWhen you run a screen for stocks with good P/E or P/B, what do you look for? You find a stock with a P/E multiple of 12. Is this good? Is this bad? Neither and both, without a frame of reference. O'Shaughnessey's method rates 6 key financial metrics for every stock against the whole market to come up with a cumulative VALUE BASED score. Those metrics are: P/E, P/B, P/FCF, P/S, EV/EBITDA, and Shareholder Yield, which is dividend yield + stock buyback yield (i.e. equity returned to the shareholder in some way).\n\nAll 6 metrics are ranked 0-100, where 100 is the \"best\" ratio in the stock universe, and 0 is the worst. The top 10% of stocks will typically have scores in the 420+ range. They are undervalued relative to the rest of the market.\n\nHowever, just because a stock is undervalued DOES NOT mean that it's a good buy. It could be facing legal action, failing drug trials, having a CEO that just went to jail, or other event that can't be reflected in these numbers. That's where momentum comes into play.\n\nWe take the top decile of stocks and reorder them by 6-month price momentum. Invest equally in the top 25, hold for a year, liquidate, repeat. The companies you buy are undervalued and the market is rallying behind them. Back testing, while not a prediction of future results, yielded a 21.2% average ROI with this method.\n\nOf course, there's no screener that does this, nor is there a way to even view \"Shareholder Yield\" in one location.\n\nWhen I started this 10 years back, [I used MatLab to solve this problem](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/46816-oshaughnessey_v5-m).  Yes, MatLab.  Wrong tool for the job.  Thankfully, ChatGPT has turned even amateur hobbyist coders into useful contributors, and a python version has been born.\n\nI'll post the results of today's run below.  Feel free to ask for a specific stock and I'll post the results of that ticker.  Keep in mind, it is filtered to Market Cap > $200M and the name of the method is Trending VALUE - your growth stocks (NVDA, TSLA, etc) are going to be viewed very poorly.\n\nEdit: You'll occasionally see a value like \"10000\" for P/E or another field.  That means the value was either missing or negative.  This is to artificially just kill that field for that ticker.",

It's a bit of a gamble, but their new model being released in 2025 will have better profit margins than the sway of declining margins in the EV industry and Musk potentially gaining 25% of voting rights whilst semi autocratic could help them catch up in AI or specifically robotics which seems to be slightly neglected in the AI race and VC funding. The bet on Tesla to be a robotics leader is the biggest gamble however they need to do something to justify their tech valuation because at the moment their primary source of profit stems from automobiles and as opposed to previous predictions they will not have a monopoly over this industry when the EV revolution is realized. If the price drops to 150 (kind of unlikely) I'll probably take a position based on the premise that the valuation is more justified and that there is potential for exponential growth in robotics",

I asked all of his relatives to pick any stock or whatever, and then I bought fractional shares to spread out the $1K. I have a record of each initial stock purchase price (people picked everything from stuff that was hot then like NET, SPCE and PLTR to things they thought he'd identify with as he got older like DIS and NKE). Others played it safe and picked mutual funds. Anyway, the 'purity' of the initial $1K is gone because I've added more money (in small amounts) as people have given additional monetary birthday gifts etc. So now I have an imbalanced mishmash. I've been putting the 'new' money in safe places -- specifically VOO, SPY and BRKB. The total is still only about $2K but over the next 18 years I expect to continue to put modest amounts in and I am curious what people think. Should I hammer one mutual fund or spread it around?

But long story short my investment portfolio has a handful of \u201cgrowth stocks\u201d that are down significantly since I bought hem (late 2020/early 2021). When I first started investing I read a few books about value investing and to some degree got lucky because my first investments were $FB (meta now) and $TSLA. This unfortunately got to my head and made me cocky and in 2020 I invested in mostly in speculative, growth stocks that I thought would mimic growth similar to $TSLA. 3 years later I am sitting with massive unrealized losses. Hell, 2 of the companies ($PTRA & $TTCF) I invested in went bankrupt already but those were relativity small positions. However I have some stocks, $SQ, $DASH, $BYND that I\u2019m seeing 5 figure unrealized losses. I have deep regrets every time I log into my account and see those losses. I could of just put it in a mutual fund and probably been net positive. It\u2019s gonna take years to recover from this.",

TSLA may also see a small downward weighting. Smaller stocks should see a small increase in the weight.\n\nETFs/mutual funds that try to follow the Nasdaq 100 (such as $QQQ) will need to adjust their holdings accordingly. So you should expect them to sell the largest stocks and buy the smaller ones -- perhaps they already have -- and that will affect the prices of those stocks accordingly.\n\nIt also means that those ETFs/mutual funds will not accurately reflect the relative weight of the largest stocks. So if you wish to be weighted according to actual market cap, you would need to supplement those holdings.\n\nNormally the index rebalances every quarter. But the largest stocks are dominating the index and funds that follow the index need to maintain compliance with a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rule on fund diversification. On July 3, the largest six stocks saw their combined weight reach 50.9% of the index.\n\nRead more in this [Reuters \"Explainer\"](https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/what-is-nasdaqs-special-rebalancing-its-impact-2023-07-11/) or [Bloomberg article](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-10/big-tech-s-dominance-in-stock-market-hits-breaking-point-for-nasdaq-100) (paywall) or Matt Levine's [Money Stuff newsletter](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2023-07-11/matt-levine-s-money-stuff-elon-musk-blames-the-lawyers) (paywall/signup)",

I've done my analysis of all the stocks mentioned below according to the analysis mentioned below. Tell me where my analysis falls short and what other methods I should consider (that don't involve technical analysis). \n\nSeeing some recent rave reviews about TSLA, ADBE, and FDX lately. Talking about the charging method Tesla uses becoming the standard in North America and being adopted by SAE, Adobe's investments in generative AI, and Fedex being able to pick up some slack if UPS workers go on strike, as well as some other investments and innovations they've been making.\n\nBut the problem is, I just don't see them valued at good prices. \n\nFDX is trading at almost 2.5x book and 21x earnings\n\nADBE is trading at 15x book, almost 47x earnings, and 12x revenue per share\n\nTSLA is trading at almost 17x book, almost 74x earnings, and over 9x revenue per share.\n\nFrom a valuation standpoint (P/B, P/E, and P/S), those numbers are completely unjustifiable when considering buying.\n\nSo is there something I'm missing? Something I'm failing to consider? It seems like in the case of TSLA and ADBE their tech advancements could be a competitive advantage. Or are these types of stocks just wildly overhyped and overpriced? Because from a valuation perspective (P/B, P/E, and P/S) things like DINO, PBR, TSN, NTR, X, HMC, WFG, BIO, and BNTX look like great buys - why wouldn't I just buy those. They seem much more fairly priced, even cheap...\n\nSo what am I missing? What else do I need to consider in my analysis, if anything?",

    "selftext": "I'm looking to create a portfolio with relatively safe tech growth stocks. I know that sounds like a bit of an oxymoron, but I'm looking to diversify out of my AAPL position. 77% of my portfolio is in the s&p 500. The rest is in AAPL.\n\nI don't think AAPL is going anywhere, and they obviously have a loyal customer base and I think Apple TV is putting out some great content. I also love how vertically integrated they are. That being said, I think they've reached market saturation in most areas and it seems the pace of innovation has slowed. I'm thinking about selling 50%+ of my AAPL position because over the years it has grown to represent 23% of my portfolio and that just seems like too much for any one individual stock.\n\nI'm considering divesting and reallocating into the following positions:\n\nGOOGL\nMSFT\nAMZN\nTSM\nNVDA\nMETA\nTSLA\n\n1. Google needs no introduction, but the stock is at super low p/e ratios and they continuously try (mostly unsuccessfully) to innovate across multiple sectors. Ads are obviously the bread and butter, but YouTube is the biggest threat to cable and streaming services. YouTube content is vast, high quality, and free!\n\n2. Microsoft is also at pretty low p/e ratios. Azure is #2 cloud service. Gaming sector is growing and Sony/PlayStation is falling behind. Biggest thing for me is their investment into AI tech such as OpenAI (aka chatGPT). Overall they have diverse revenue streams and continue to innovate.\n\n3. Amazon is not just ecommerce, but at absolute logistics giant. #1 cloud service. Decent streaming service. And they continuously reinvest into the company. They're also down more than others on this list in the past year.\n\n4. Taiwanese Semiconductor is the world's leading chip manufacturer. P/e is low, but partly because of inflated chip prices. Biggest fear is Chinese government interference, but the $40 billion investment into the Arizona factory is encouraging.\n\n5. Nvidia makes the most powerful chips in the world and has great partnerships with other leaders in tech. Also one of the leaders in AI technology. Downside is sky high p/e and it's down the least over the last year, so not the best value.\n\n6. META for me is the hardest to evaluate. On one hand Facebook and Instagram are absolute social media giants that print money, but on the other hand I don't see nearly as much potential for growth. VR technology is cool, but it's a long way away from being mainstream. If that ever happens, there's no guarantee that META will be the ones to do it.\n\n7. Tesla has obviously been hammered the most on this list, but I'm not sure it's totally warranted. Whatever Musk is doing at Twitter shouldn't really affect Tesla as much as it has. P/e ratio is back to reality somewhat and they continue to lead ev sales. Other manufacturers are struggling to catch up, it's happening, but much slower than anyone expected. If Tesla continues to keep it's foot on the gas and continues to improve it's qc and manufacturing processes, I see them remaining a leader in the ev field for years to come.\n\n\nSo Reddit, what do you think of my choices? And are there any other companies you think I missed and should look into? What percentage would you allocate into the above companies?",

Though wise, I think this financial advice undermines one major flaw; the United States may or may not collapse in the future.

I never considered foreign indices (Hang Sang, Nikkei 225, DAX40, FTSE100) due to their underperformance compared to US indices, however, this recent thought has inspired the possibility of re-allocation to invest in international markets. Zooming out even further, this argument may lead to the idea that investing in the entire planet Earth may be \"putting all of your eggs in one basket\", and that the entire human population can be wiped to zero in a mass extinction event. At that point, we would have much bigger problems than an underperforming portfolio.",
