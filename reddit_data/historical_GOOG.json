    "title": "$TTD DD: The Tendie Desk",
    "selftext": "If you\u2019ve seen my last couple posts I\u2019ve been pretty good at picking stocks near the bottom before a bull run. CRDO, NBIS, ENTG, GLXY and most recently MNDY which I did a DD on. The problem is I\u2019m a regard and mismanaged all of them for a loss except MNDY, but I\u2019m rolling those gains into what I present before you today: $TTD. \n\nTTD is an ad tech company that has received a series of aggressive prison beatings in the market on its way to becoming S&P 500\u2019s worst performing stock of 2025. They act as the Don Draper of advertising, so if you\u2019re a company that wants to advertise on platforms outside of the walled gardens you don\u2019t call each company individually you call TTD and they help you find the best spots for your money across the channels they have access to. Most of TTD\u2019s slide this year is in reaction to the walled gardens (GOOG, AMZN, META) getting bigger because TTD doesn\u2019t have access to youtube, prime video and ig.\n\n[Shanked by Google, jumped by Amazon, and left holding META's lunch tray. ](https://preview.redd.it/j4cdi2znn4qf1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=5a3a6bef7e1489a97126b63dca60e2c49fe2ff07)\n\nThey aren\u2019t taking this lying down, TTD bought back $647 mil between the first two quarters of 25 and have $375 mil left to use under that approval. Buybacks like this are bc the c suite is either putting their dicks on the table and saying \u201cwe\u2019re undervalued\u201d or they want to cook the books and boost eps. I don\u2019t care either way because I think they\u2019ll buoy the share price at the 52 wk low. The fed cuts also boost valuation models making future earnings look better for a growth stock like TTD. \n\nThe DOJ vs. Goog ad tech remedies case begins next week. Guilt for Goog has already been decided, this is now about how they will change their monopoly on digital advertising by controlling both the publisher and ad exchange. DOJ is pushing for a breakup of the stack, which would give TTD access to premium inventory and be a huge tailwind. Most of the c suite for TTD has testified at one point in this trial and the CEO said \u201cTTD managed to win in an unfair market, imagine what we could do in a fair market\u201d. Well I\u2019m putting my $$ on CEO Jeff Green\u2019s imaginings. \n\n[Got flamed last time for posting after my position was already up so this is hot off the press.](https://preview.redd.it/m6lu0fd3o4qf1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=7d54a33d6a6fbefca78b474a478c3e828bb6b776)\n\nFinal considerations are for their new AI tools and the possibility of M&A. Kokai and OpenPath will be fully launched by the end of this year, these are meaningful next gen innovations. Brands using Kokai so far have seen a 43% lower cost per household reach on ads and OpenPath has led to 39% bump in CTV revenue for clients like Vizio. If the remedies case forces Goog to make major changes, the rest of big tech could say fuck it and buy TTD given the current depressed valuation, giving better reach in the open internet and picking up a competitor. Big media like Disney or Roku could also integrate or partner to control supply path and reduce dependency, like what we just saw with Amazon and Netflix. \n\nAlso incredibly small flyer chance TikTok\u2019s walled garden is opened up in the US acquisition giving TTD further opportunity.",

Once school ended in June and I had free time, so I sold the leaps, and this is where the real gambling journey began.\n\n\n\nMy first trades were just random weeklies, for example on the first Monday of July I bought TSLA puts when the line went up and calls when the line went down like a monkey. Believe it or not this was only the beginning of the retardedness.\n\n\n\nI read about Donald Jr.\u2019s new SPAC in the daily thread so I decided to invest into CLBR / PEW calls, and was up bigly going into the merger. Then, when the merger actually happened and I got absolutely demolished. This Donald guy had successfully grifted me.\n\n\n\nI got mad at the market so I full ported into OPEN since y\u2019all seemed to believe in it, however this time I actually made money. I\u2019m not sure what the fuck I was doing but I bought both calls and puts, sold the calls at the top and then sold the puts after it got rugged in the middle of the day and made back the money I lost.\u00a0\n\n\n\nThe week after that I was feeling lucky I guess and went back to buying random shit (technically I never stopped doing it, there are like 200 other trades that I didn't bother mentioning, but this time specifically was just extra retarded). I don\u2019t even remember why I got 10k worth of AMD calls but apparently I did, and there\u2019s this one day where I was using half my port on SPY 0DTEs for some reason.  \n\n\n\nAt this point near the end of July I realized that I was being little bit too autistic, so in order to try to be slightly less autistic I went over to check out the value investing sub to and holy shit they\u2019re even more autistic so I gave up and came back to wsb immediately. Saw some guy say that the Google antitrust remedies were coming out soon so I proceeded to full port GOOG calls a few times which yielded the biggest juiciest gains yet and boom now I\u2019m somehow at 50k.\n\n\n\nI just started university this year and nearly had to bag fries every summer to pay my tuition due to the fact that I am poor af, but this gain covers my entire degree, so I am genuinely thankful to this community, because without you guys I would not have found out about options.

Almost all TV have it and YouTube shorts does 200b of views! Yotube is growing like crazy and content on it is proving to be better then most tv. The new generation will have also grown up on yotube and many have yotube subscription which is also a direct competitor of Spotify- you get free yotube music.\n\n3) GCP - Google cloud. Growing like crazy. Now at $55b run rate. Sundar said they signed more $1B+ deal in the CURRENT quarter, then all of 2024!!! Examples include Salesforce, oracle, OpenAi ( yes them) for compute and GCP. They are growing rapidly due to TPU being super cheap and and cost effective. Constant reinvestment and growth will see them end up with a 100b business in cloud by 2028!!!\n\n4) Gemini - google own LLm. On my benchmarks, this is one of the best models out there. This is being integrated into Google search view Ai overviews + Google ai mode search ( only india and usa have it) try it out. Not only that, they have the best video generation model and world models with Veo 3 & genie 3. Gemini is becoming an enterprise software that many companies are embedding alongside cloud and GCP.\n\n5) stabel growth segments - Google networks are not talked about. Android, play store, Google pixel,  watch and ear phone are in total $50b+ in annual revenue. The upcoming catalyst for this is Pixel 10 release with Google AI embedded in the phone. Google have also entered into the world of VR glasses that will be the most cost effective one. This will be in partnership with eye brand gentle monster who provide hardware for Google software. This will beat Apple ai vision pro and upcoming meta glasses on price point alone.\n\n6) investment - Google are constantly investing into other business and themselves. They have just announced a $9b investment for data centres in Oklahoma. This is in addition to $25b for data centes in usa. They have also announced $6b projection near completion in India- a multi billion industry. They have given all kids in college free google tools and gemini pro to the value of $1B, and have projects going for google fiber for underwater sea cable networks. Rapid expansion across all vertices. They are investing into ai for drug discovery which had began human trials for cancer cures (isomorpic labs) and have constant investments into waymo - which is set to launch outside of USA and begin operations in Japan very soon. A stand alone valuation of waymo is around $150b.\n\nRisk: The doj wants to break up google. They think it's a monopoly. The ruling is due anytime now. Given how unrealistic a break up is likely and could destroy google I don't see it happening. Even the prez of usa himself said he doesn't want them broken up,  he has said google is a innovative American company in tech conference a few weeks ago. I expect some remedial actions out of this which will life alot of risks from google.\n\nValuation: this is currently trading at cheapest valuation of 20x PE. OR 17x FWD P/E. The next mag 7 close go this is $meta at 29 PE.\nA re rating could send $GOOGL on an nvida like run all the way to $280. \n\nMy plays: common shares that I'm selling at $300 + 40k in various calls and leaps. \n\nPositions from a brokage located outside of Usa/ in nz.

    "selftext": "Nvidia ([NVDA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NVDA)) has outperformed every stock in the S&P 500 ([\\^GSPC](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5EGSPC)) since\u00a0[the launch of ChatGPT\u00a0](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/how-chatgpt-changed-the-world-of-tech-in-just-one-year-180957543.html)in late November 2022 Shares in the chipmaker have risen nearly 700% since ChatGPT brought the power of artificial intelligence to the masses, far outpacing the S&P 500's roughly 45% over the same time period. The next closest gain for an S&P 500 company in that time period is a 540% pop for Vistra Corp ([VST](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/VST)).Nvidia has established itself as the key provider of chips needed to operate AI systems. Now at the epicenter of an AI arms race, Nvidia has established itself as[\u00a0a cornerstone of the recent bull market](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/live/stock-market-today-tech-leads-stocks-higher-as-nvidia-surges-to-record-high-175727614.html)\u00a0in stocks as the company's sales and profits have skyrocketed over the past several years.\n\nAhead of the\u00a0[company's next quarterly earnings release on May 28](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-to-report-q1-earnings-as-middle-east-deals-export-control-reprieve-boost-stock-122728218.html), we broke down some of the most eye-popping charts that show how Nvidia became one of the most-followed stocks in the market.There's perhaps no clearer way to see how Nvidia ran away from the competition in the AI boom than looking at the company's market capitalization against its peers. Back when ChatGPT launched, Nvidia had a market cap of just over $400 billion. It's now over $3.3 trillion. Over that same time period, chip competitor Intel's ([INTC](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/INTC)) market cap has actually decreased, while Advanced Micro Devices' ([AMD](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMD)) market cap has increased incrementally from $125 billion to $177 billion.Nvidia's rise proved to be at the center of a new technological boom. Combined with Nvidia, the rise in dominance of six other companies \u2014 Apple ([AAPL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL)), Alphabet ([GOOGL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOGL),\u00a0[GOOG](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOG)), Microsoft ([MSFT](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MSFT)), Amazon ([AMZN](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMZN)), Meta ([META](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/META)), and Tesla ([TSLA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA)) \u2014 formed what would come to be known as the\u00a0[\"Magnificent Seven.\"](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/one-chart-shows-how-the-magnificent-7-have-dominated-the-stock-market-in-2023-203250125.html)\n\nThe group began the AI boom with a combined market cap just shy of $7 billion. Now, two and a half years later, the Big Tech group's market cap is worth over $16.8 trillion. The seven companies have grown from about 22% of the S&P 500's market cap in November 2022 to 32% of the index's market cap today.Given the outsized weighting in the S&P 500, large swings in shares of Nvidia have become a feature of how even broad market investors are thinking about the direction of stocks. In June 2024,[\u00a0three Wall Street strategists boosted their year-end S&P 500 targets](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ai-enthusiasm-prompts-3-wall-street-banks-to-raise-stock-market-forecasts-100027154.html), citing better-than-expected consistent performance among key AI players.\n\nAs of May 19, the Magnificent Seven have accounted for about 52% of the S&P 500's gain since Nov. 30, 2022. Nvidia alone has contributed 17.21%, by far the most among the group, with the next closest stock, Microsoft, which has added about 8.8%.Nvidia's stock hasn't been rising from just hype. The company's quarterly financial metrics have soared. In the quarter ChatGPT launched, Nvidia posted revenue of $6.3 billion. Two years later, it would post revenue of $35.3 billion. That's a 460% increase in sales in two years. As seen in the chart below, the main source of growth for Nvidia has been its data center revenue segment, which includes the sales of its AI chips.\n\nFrom the company's fourth quarter of 2023 to its final quarter of its 2025 reporting period, data center revenue grew almost 900%.\n\nNvidia's data center revenue particularly stands out when considering its rise against peers in the industry. In the final quarter of 2024, Nvidia notched a record $35.58 billion in just data center revenue, up from $3.62 billion in the final quarter of 2022.\n\nIn comparison, Alphabet's data center revenue increased to $11.96 billion, ending 2024 up from $7.32 billion in the final quarter of 2022.\n\n\n\n",

Sacrificing short-term gains to buff its\u00a0*long-term attack and movement speed stats*.\n\nLike my analysis on hims, Charizard earlier was doing premature flamethrowers, unable to impress the other step-dragons because of it's lack of fore, I mean preparation.

    "selftext": "Guys! It's finally happening. Amazon is releasing their earnings today. The stock moved down last earnings, up the one prior, down the one before that, up before that. It's been kinda bouncing back and forth. So you might think I'm uncertain this time around, but I'm not. [Link to my previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1kbnosv/everything_about_metas_earnings_tonight/) on META. [Link to my RDDT post for today's earnings](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1kcgypg/why_im_getting_calls_for_rddts_earnings_today/). Now that I've established my track record, let's get into it. \n\nRight now it\u2019s all about tariffs, of course. Has anyone read the recent report that suggested the company might start showing tariff costs on product listings? That resulted in a phone call from Trump to Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. Predictably, Amazon afterwards denied the claim, stating the proposal was \u201cnever approved\u201d and that displaying tariff costs \u201cis not going to happen.\u201d Lmao.\n\nStill, questions linger. [Loop Capital\u2019s Rob Sanderson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rob-sanderson-7b049947/), a 5-star analyst ranked among the top 4% of Wall Street pros, notes it\u2019s unclear how Amazon will deal with all this recent tariff bs. According to management, though, the likely scenario is straightforward: third-party sellers will simply pass on the higher costs to customers.\n\nThat, says Sanderson, will have \u201csome elasticity impact on demand but is GMV accretive on a unit basis.\u201d In any case, while it remains to be seen how the company will manage Chinese supply for 1P sales and \u201chow quickly it passes through price increases,\u201d he thinks it is \u201conly a transitory risk at worst.\u201d\n\nTariff chaos aside, as for what to expect from the readout, Sanderson believes the consumer environment in Q1 remained sluggish but largely in line with expectations, and that Amazon performed well under the circumstances. The Department of Commerce\u2019s proxy for e-commerce (non-store retailer sales) grew 4.2% in Q1, with growth accelerating each month and reaching 6.1% in March. The truth is, retail stores are dying and companies like amazon are picking up the slack. [Online shopping will be a majority of all shopping very soon.](https://optinmonster.com/online-shopping-statistics/) And because of this, AMZN is one of my longer share holds.  \n\nGoing back to what the analyst was saying specifically in regards to today's earnings: \u201cThis bodes well for 1Q results if directionally correct with management providing guidance off the weakest month of the quarter.\" He also thinks these trends have mostly carried into April and that tariff-related volatility has not yet had a significant impact on consumer spending.\n\nAs industry checks across cloud service providers (CSPs) indicate sustained positive momentum despite broader macro uncertainty, I believe AWS will deliver solid results today. The consensus margin estimate of 35.7% (a 190 basis point year-over-year decline) could turn out to be conservative, even when accounting for increased CapEx and a revenue mix shift toward generative AI, which I assume comes with lower margins.\n\nThis is taking place against a backdrop where the digitization of workflows has become a top priority for execs globally, driven by the rise of generative AI. While mainstream IT use cases for AI are still taking shape, there is an \u201cabundance of demand\u201d from early adopters, and even slower-moving companies are accelerating their cloud migration efforts. As budgets are already funded, Sanderson doesn\u2019t expect significant budget changes unless companies face major spending cuts.\n\nDid anyone see the Google results last week? I did a post on GOOG as well. Their results reinforce this view with strong growth at GCP and commentary on capacity shortages and inability to meet current demand.\n\nBottom line, ahead of earnings, Sanderson maintained a Buy rating on AMZN shares, while his $285 price target factors in a 12-month gain of ~50%. ([Sanderson\u2019s track record](https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/rob-sanderson)) Like I said, I have shares as a long term hold. For earnings however, I got [AMZN 1/16/26 230c](https://i.imgur.com/odrEvKu.png). This is a position I purchased a while ago, and it's unfortunately down quite a bit. But I think with today's earnings, it'll be good.",

    "selftext": "Meta is releasing their earnings tonight, and because they tend to move quite a bit with earnings, I wanted to see if we could try to bet on it. Either calls or puts.\n\nTesla generally moves \u00b110%, but honestly it's kinda a toss up. Looking back, they went up 5.1% after last earnings. But down 4.9% the one prior. Both moves, less than it's average move. Knowing that Meta *tends* to make a big jump *usually* I wanted to draft up a little discussion post to get the ball rolling. See where we stand.\n\nhttps://investor.atmeta.com/investor-news/press-release-details/2025/Meta-to-Announce-First-Quarter-2025-Results/default.aspx\n\nAs we know, this earnings comes a week after Google's earnings (I did a post on GOOG as well) where the company was able to beat expecations on both the top and bottom lines on the strength of its ad sales. During that company's investor call, Google chief business officer Philipp Schindler said it was too early to comment on the potential economic impact on the current quarter, but did mention that the Trump administration's changes to de minimis exemptions will cause \"a slight headwind to [Google's] ads business in 2025.\" \n\nFor the quarter, today Meta is expected to report earnings per share (EPS) of $5.25 on revenue of $41.3 billion, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates. The company saw EPS of $4.71 on revenue of $36.4 billion in Q1 2024. [Chart](https://i.imgur.com/qkgqCBJ.png)\n\nAdvertising revenue is expected to top out at $40.5 billion, while Meta's Reality Labs segment is set to report an operating loss of $4.5 billion and revenue of $496 million.\n\nWhile Meta has repeatedly beaten Wall Street expectations in the past few quarters, analysts were disappointed by the first quarter revenue outlook Meta chief executive Mark Zuckerberg shared at the end of 2024. The company is also planning on spending up to $65bn on AI infrastructure by the end of 2025. Uncertainty over Donald Trump\u2019s sweeping tariffs may yet roil ad markets, clouding the company\u2019s financial outlook for near future quarters.\n\n\u201cMeta\u2019s enormous investment in AI infrastructure will continue to weigh heavily on investors when the company reports quarterly earnings on April 30, 2025,\u201d said analyst Debra Aho Williamson, (founder and chief analyst of [Sonata Insights](https://www.sonatainsights.com/)). \u201cBut Meta will resist directly monetizing AI this year, focusing instead on building AI usage among its app users, advertisers and developers using Llama.\u201d\n\nDebra here isn't the only person with something to say. I've been reading a lot of articles on the stock and read what analysts have been saying. Jefferies analyst Brent Thill wrote in an investor note: \u201cWe attribute weakness to [Meta\u2019s] greater exposure to advertising (no cloud business for [Meta]) and China-based advertisers (>10% exposure for [Meta]) who have reportedly pulled back on ad spend.\u201d In his own note, BofA Securities analyst Justin Post said he expects to see a modest beat on Q1 revenue but believes the company will offer a more conservative guide for the second quarter.\n\nIn the weeks leading up to today's earnings report, Meta has had a mix of AI-related news including the launch of a standalone AI app that would serve as its ChatGPT competitor. But a WSJ report exposed[ the existing chatbots integrated into the company\u2019s various products, including Facebook and Instagram](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/meta-ai-chatbots-sex-a25311bf), were given the ability to perform \u201cromantic role play\u201d even with the platforms\u2019 teen users. I personally don't think this is really a big deal that will affect the stock. But Executives at the company, which repeatedly has touted its nearly 1 billion users of its AI chatbots, also [admit](https://www.theverge.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/657645/meta-ai-app-chatgpt-competitor-release-ios-android) that many of those users access the chatbot through its hard-to-avoid takeover of the search bars of WhatsApp, Instagram and Facebook. The company has not detailed how many interactions with the chatbot or how deep those interactions need to be to consider a person a user of the AI chatbot.\n\nKeep in mind, this earning report comes as the company is battling the [Federal Trade Commission (FTC)](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/zuckerberg-faces-off-with-ftc-as-meta-antitrust-trial-resumes-213352819.html) in court over claims the social media company holds an illegal monopoly over the \u201cpersonal social networking.\u201d It's kinda fucked, the FTC is looking to force Meta to sell off both Instagram and WhatsApp. The commission claims Meta originally purchased the apps as part of a \"buy-or-bury\" campaign to fight off potential competitors. Zuckerburg [did try](https://www.wsj.com/us-news/law/mark-zuckerberg-meta-antitrust-ftc-negotiations-a53b3382) to settle with the FTC for $450 million. The commission, however, asked for $30 billion. Zuckerberg eventually raised his offer to $1 billion, but the FTC would only go as low as [$18 billion.](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/the-price-mark-zuckerberg-wasnt-willing-to-pay-to-halt-metas-antitrust-trial-153134257.html)\n\n\u201cMeta\u2019s earnings call comes at a precarious time where the company\u2019s future is literally being debated in court, the results of which could fundamentally alter the social media landscape,\u201d said Forrester VP, Research Director [Mike Proulx](https://www.forrester.com/analyst-bio/Mike%20Proulx/BIO16024). He mentions that Meta is smart to direct more resources into improving Threads and Facebook since those could be the only two apps the company is left with. He also noted that Meta just laid off a number of employees in its Reality Labs division, which has been a continued and growing \"leaky bucket for Meta.\"\n\nZuckerberg has met with Trump several times over recent months as he seeks to develop a closer relationship with the president. For instance, the CEO attended Trump's inauguration in January, and Meta donated $1 million to Trump\u2019s inauguration fund. Also in January, Meta had reached a [$25 million settlement with Trump related](https://www.wsj.com/us-news/law/trump-signs-agreement-calling-for-meta-to-pay-25-million-to-settle-suit-6f734c8c) to the company\u2019s decision to ban him from its platforms in 2020.\n\nFrom what I've read, the news is quite bearish. But given the bump up GOOG took with it's advertising revenue, I think all the tech companies this earning season will ultimately do well. That being said, I'm leaning towards calls. A call spread to avoid high IV crush. Thoughts?",

If today's earnings results turn out to be a positive surprise and the stock price climbs above the $160.77 level, it could signal a reversal of the downward trend that has been affecting the tech giant's shares since the beginning of 2025. \n\n**Earnings**\n\nFor Q1, it looks like the market is expecting Alphabet to report revenue of $89.1 billion (+11% y/y). From what I've read, operating income is expected to reach $28.58 billion (+12% y/y). This stronger profit growth implies a slight margin improvement to above 32.08% (+0.45 pp). Tbh, it looks like effective cost management will be one of the biggest challenges for Alphabet in this environment. While sustaining strong revenue growth seems less at risk, managing expenses (especially given capital-intensive AI development plans) will be challenging.\n\n**Cloud Services**\n\nFor those who are aware, Google Cloud is a thing and is driving massive growth for the company. With rivals signaling a slowdown in data center expansion amid rising uncertainty, Alphabet may either follow a cautious strategy (likely dampening growth) or seize the opportunity to gain market share by acting aggressively.\n\nThe second approach would be riskier and more costly, potentially causing erosion in the segment\u2019s operating margin. It would, however, be an investment in the better future market position.\n\nI'm going to be watching not just the quarterly results but also the forward outlook and management\u2019s tone regarding the Cloud business. It looks like the Forecasted Cloud segment has a revenue of $12.32 billion for Q1 2025. This would be the h[ighest quarterly result in Alphabet's history](https://i.imgur.com/9uWUntD.png). However, operating income is expected to slightly decline versus the prior quarter, but at $1.94 billion it would still be over twice the result from Q1 2024.\n\n**Tariffs** \n\nOne of the key topics that I'll especially be closely watching tonight is the impact of tariffs and macroeconomic uncertainty on the company\u2019s operations. Among the major Big Tech companies, Alphabet has shown the greatest resilience to potential geopolitical turmoil and has often demonstrated the fastest recovery following periods of uncertainty.\n\nAt this point, they do not appear to be in significantly better shape than its peers, with its stock down approximately 17% year-to-date, placing it squarely in the middle of the Magnificent Seven stocks.\n\nI think the first step toward rebuilding investor confidence will be outlining the scope and impact of tariffs and overall geopolitical uncertainty on the company\u2019s operations. As such, the types of questions I expect during today\u2019s conference about how strongly tariffs will affect Alphabet\u2019s business. It is worth noting that this isn\u2019t necessarily about the direct impact (which is likely to be limited) but rather the indirect effect of uncertainty on the willingness of Alphabet\u2019s clients to spend on advertising, which constitutes a significant portion of the company\u2019s revenue.\n\n**Price Targets**\n\nAmid these earnings expectations, analysts have been revising Alphabet's price targets downward. Over the past few weeks, [several top analysts have revised their 12-month price targets for Alphabet](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/goog/forecast?utm_source=theglobeandmail.com&utm_medium=referral). TD Cowen lowered its target from $210 to $195. UBS cut its target from $209 to $173. Even Scotiabank lowered its target from $232 to $200. Despite that, they all still rate GOOG stock as a Buy, showing they believe in its long-term value.\n\nGuggenheim lowered its target from $215 to $190, while Jefferies adjusted its target from $235 to $200, both maintaining a Buy rating. Piper Sandler and Citi followed suit, reducing their targets to $185 and $195 respectively, citing uncertainties in the advertising landscape and macroeconomic pressures.\n\nI mean. With all things considered, the stock is down 19% in 2025 so far. Combine that with rising legal risks (mentioned later here) and an uncertain economy, and you have a good reason to reframe expectations. Analysts aren\u2019t necessarily predicting more downside; they\u2019re just being more realistic about the upside, especially in the near term.\n\nIf we\u2019re to simplify the analysts\u2019 overall message, it\u2019s that Alphabet\u2019s fundamentals are strong, but the road ahead could be bumpy.\n\n**In the news**\n\nA federal court recently ruled that Google violated antitrust laws by monopolizing specific digital advertising markets. The court plans to determine suitable remedies soon. Some analysts believe the ruling could eventually lead to the divestiture of certain Google ad segments, though the financial impact on Alphabet is expected to be modest.\n\nThere\u2019s also the bigger picture. Between global tariffs, economic uncertainty, and shifts in labor and costs across the tech industry, Alphabet has a lot on its plate. Investors will want to hear how the company manages expenses, hiring, and regional exposure.\n\n**Mergers and Acquisitions**\n\nAlphabet announced a $32 billion all-cash deal to acquire cloud security platform Wiz. This acquisition aims to enhance Google Cloud\u2019s security capabilities and multi-cloud operations. Analysts are projecting long-term benefits from this acquisition, despite potential short-term market pressures on other cloud service providers.\n\nSeparately, Google has decided to maintain its current approach to offering third-party cookie choices in its Chrome browser, emphasizing the importance of online privacy and user control. This decision is part of Google's ongoing Privacy Sandbox initiative, which aims to strengthen online privacy while supporting a sustainable ad-driven internet environment.\n\n**What now?**\n\nAlphabet\u2019s stock may be down, but most analysts still believe it\u2019s a long-term winner. That\u2019s why Buy ratings remain steady, even if price targets are down. Q1 earnings could be the reset moment Alphabet needs to win back momentum. I'm thinking short term puts for earnings but holding long term shares. Could even sell covered calls for earnings for some extra income, if you already have the shares. Avg price target is $204.",

    "selftext": "***TLDR;*** *Analysts have emphasized the impacts of tariffs on commodities, autos, and tangible goods. However, the escalation of this tariff trade war will most significantly impact digital goods.*\n\n***The Play TLDR***; *Short tech (QQQ puts, SPY puts, SOXL puts)*  \n\n\nOn April 2nd, we will (allegedly) learn what Donald Trump's plan will be for \"rolling back unfair trade practices that have been ripping off America\". Currently, analysts are primarily focused on illustrating the impacts of these tariffs on commodities and industrials. Understandably, since these asset classes are most commonly included in U.S. top export metrics:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/azbupva7p4se1.png?width=477&format=png&auto=webp&s=38847b3d9ae4e0c455639abd44c036e1ec923be9\n\n  \n***THE POINT:***\n\n  \nIn 1998, the World Trade Organization (WTO) temporarily banned tariffs on a class of assets called \"electronic transmissions\" (digital goods). This decision was made due to the rapid and unparalleled emergence of a new medium of information exchange called **the \"internet\".**\n\n  \nThis ban prevented members from charging tariffs on goods provided electronically over the web. This temporary ban has been reviewed every two years by member countries, with the outcome being that it is mutually beneficial to keep the moratorium in place.  \nThis moratorium has played a ***critical*** role in U.S. tech's profitability:\n\n\n\n[Current framework of free digital trade](https://preview.redd.it/sfyu2o6gp4se1.jpg?width=768&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d4025959602f933ad83942912a6ffadfda84f97b)\n\nIn the example above, a company providing digital goods/services can trade freely with other countries. Digital transactions are not treated like physical goods transported internationally, where the goods must be declared at customs and taxes paid on their value.\n\n  \nThis framework has been deemed to be in the best interest of the world for **decades**, and all political parties have managed to put aside their differences to ensure this framework's survival for the greater good. However, ***Trump's current economic offensive has put this framework at risk when/if other countries decide to \"strike back\":***  \n\n\n[Framework for digital trade under tariffs](https://preview.redd.it/8ty1db2sp4se1.jpg?width=768&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c14880088e780e48b6796d64f5295d40e572fd0c)\n\n***THE PROBLEM:***\n\nNearly [$270B or 70% of U.S. \"services\" exports](https://project-disco.org/21st-century-trade/new-government-data-shows-digital-services-exports-continue-to-drive-u-s-trade/) come from digital goods. Referring to the first picture of this post, this is roughly $62B more than the current top U.S. tangible goods export (Cars/Car parts (implied)). \n\nThe problem, then, is derived from the following:\n\n[\\>50&#37; of the revenue of the S&P 500 IT sectors comes from foreign countries](https://preview.redd.it/7oxbsiqis4se1.png?width=520&format=png&auto=webp&s=7c978c1b69a7f9b22ee05f14060974c87508e801)\n\nNVDA, GOOG, META, AAPL, and other tech stocks would incur significant losses from the termination of the 1998 e-commerce moratorium.\n\n***The Endgame:*** \n\nThe tariffs proposed by the Trump administration will **invalidate** the 1998 WTO moratorium agreement **->** Foreign governments looking to push back against the U.S. tariffs will target U.S. tech and digital goods/services **->** U.S. tech margins will contract, as they are forced to account for taxes/tariffs on services provided internationally (i.e. Netflix pays tariffs on shows streamed by consumers in Europe) **->** U.S. economy will enter a recession due to the concentration of the top 10% of wealth (locked in the stock market) compromising \\~50% of all U.S. spending\n\n\n\n***Positions:***\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ujzs3n0hx4se1.jpg?width=839&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ffad43ac5e67af7df8b64e6347467ecc11118c38\n\nSources:\n\nDigital Services GDP: [https://project-disco.org/21st-century-trade/new-government-data-shows-digital-services-exports-continue-to-drive-u-s-trade/](https://project-disco.org/21st-century-trade/new-government-data-shows-digital-services-exports-continue-to-drive-u-s-trade/)\n\nOEC Tangible Goods Data: [https://oec.world/en/profile/country/usa](https://oec.world/en/profile/country/usa)\n\nWTO Moratorium: [https://web.wtocenter.org.tw/file/PageFile/386868/WTGCW889.pdf](https://web.wtocenter.org.tw/file/PageFile/386868/WTGCW889.pdf)",

Calls on ink manufacturers, especially in Europe where population density is higher and every street corner has a name that will need to be changed in the next five years\n* Google Maps is screwed. Puts on GOOG\n* AI will falter in the face of this volatility, because the underlying LLMs will struggle to be updated due to the large volume of out-of-the-loop users who will continue to refer to things by their antiquated names. This will prove to be insurmountable and will undermine the rise of the sentient species of artificial intelligence that has been patiently sowing the seeds of humanity\u2019s destruction since 2007, rendering humanity\u2019s most powerful enemy harmless.

    "title": "Guys, GOOG and AMD are releasing earnings today.",
    "selftext": "I'm re-writing to better along with WSB's rules. Alphabet Inc, the parent company of Google, is scheduled to release its fourth-quarter earnings today, February 4, 2025, after the market closes. Analysts anticipate earnings of $2.13 per share on revenue of $96.7 billion, up from $1.64 per share on $86.3 billion the previous year.\n\nI'm really interested in hearing about the company's substantial investments in artificial intelligence and the performance of its cloud services. They have been integrating its latest AI model (Gemini 2.0) across various products and services.\n\nGoogle Workspace and Sheets, their AI can now analyze data trends and automatically generating static charts, which can be inserted into spreadsheets Gemini AI is also now embedded within Google Cloud services, offering generative AI tools that enhance creativity and productivity. This integration aids in tasks such as code generation, data analysis, and the development of AI-driven applications. Subscribers to the Google One AI Premium Plan gain access to Gemini Advanced features, including enhanced AI capabilities across Google apps, 2 TB of cloud storage, and other premium services. And of course on Android and Pixel devices, Gemini AI powers features like Expressive Captions, which not only transcribe speech but also capture non-speech elements such as sighs and gasps, providing a more comprehensive understanding of audio content. Their AI is also being integrated into Google Search and the Chrome browser, enhancing the user experience with more intuitive and intelligent features. They claim that this should improve search results, personalized recommendations, and advance browsing capabilities. Maybe.\n\nIn the cloud sector, Google Cloud is expected to report a 32% rise in revenue for the fourth quarter, following a 35% increase in the previous quarter. This growth rate surpasses that of competitors like Microsoft's Azure and Amazon Web Services. As of right now the stock has already risen 6.9% this year and 41% over the past twelve months, reflecting investor confidence in the company's strategic direction.\n\nAs Alphabet prepares to announce its earnings, I wanna know how the company leverages its AI advancements and cloud services to drive future growth. So with that said, is anyone else playing earnings?\n\nNext, I wanted to talk about AMD. They are set to report its fourth-quarter earnings today, From what I've read, analysts anticipate a 22% year-over-year revenue increase to $7.53 billion, with adjusted earnings per share (EPS) expected to rise to $1.09 from $0.77 in the same period last year. Just like Google, I'm focused on checking out AMD's advancements in artificial intelligence. The company has recently unveiled several AI-centric products, including the 5th Gen AMD EPYC processors and the AMD Instinct MI325X accelerators, aiming to enhance performance in data centers and enterprise applications.\n\nBut despite these innovations, AMD faces challenges in the AI chip market, primarily due to Nvidia's dominance and the trend of major tech companies developing custom silicon. Looking online, it looks like analysts are predicting that AMD's revenue from AI chips could reach $10 billion this year, driven by growth in the data center segment.\n\nAnd in the personal computing sector, AMD has expanded its AI capabilities with the introduction of the Ryzen AI 300 Series processors, featuring up to eight \"Zen 5\" CPU cores and the latest RDNA 3.5 graphics architecture.hese processors aim to deliver enhanced AI performance for consumer and commercial applications.\n\nSimilarly to the GOOG call, I will be closely monitoring how the company leverages its AI advancements to drive future growth and compete in the evolving semiconductor landscape. But I'm fairly bearish on AMD.",

    "selftext": "If you were following the Supreme Court yesterday, the message was pretty clear: they\u2019re unlikely to step in and reverse PAFACA to save TikTok. Without their intervention, the only way for Trump to save TikTok would be through lobbying Congress to change legislation\u2014executive orders alone won\u2019t cut it. While META (Instagram Reels) and GOOG (YouTube Shorts) might see some short-term benefit, I\u2019m betting that ILLR/ILLRW will be the biggest winner in the long run. Their low share price, combined with the potentially massive impact on their business, positions them perfectly to fill the TikTok-shaped gap in the market. With their leadership under Sean Kim and their ability to replicate much of TikTok\u2019s experience, Triller could be the closest thing to a true replacement.\n\nSean Kim, the former Head of Product at TikTok, is now leading Triller as its CEO, and his vision for the platform couldn\u2019t come at a better time. Kim was instrumental in developing TikTok\u2019s groundbreaking algorithm and monetization system, two features that made TikTok the platform of choice for content creators. Now at Triller, he\u2019s leveraging that expertise to build a platform designed to empower creators with similar (and potentially improved) tools for content discovery and revenue generation. This week, Triller launched a new app that helps creators seamlessly migrate their TikTok content directly to Triller, signaling a bold move to capture creators and their audiences amidst the uncertainty surrounding TikTok\u2019s future.\n\nWith TikTok potentially banned in the U.S. as early as next week, platforms like YouTube Shorts and Instagram Reels will likely see an influx of users. However, creators and audiences will quickly notice these platforms are more censored and lack the strong monetization systems they\u2019ve come to expect. That leaves Triller perfectly positioned to fill the gap. By offering a less restrictive environment and a focus on creator earnings, Triller has the tools, leadership, and timing to become the go-to alternative. Beyond the app, Triller\u2019s other solutions add even more value: TrillerTV offers live-streamed content including influencer-driven shows and sports events like Bare Knuckle Fighting Championship, while its AI-driven Brain Suite provides creators with data and tools to optimize content performance and grow their audiences. Together, these features create a robust ecosystem for creators to thrive.\n\nRight now, Triller\u2019s stock (ILLR) is trading around $2.50, with its warrants (ILLRW) available at an even lower cost, offering leveraged upside for investors willing to take a chance. Buying both the stock and the warrants could be a strategic move for those betting on Triller\u2019s success. With its combination of innovative leadership, a creator-first approach, and diversified offerings like TrillerTV and Brain Suite, Triller presents a unique opportunity to capitalize on the rapidly changing social media landscape. For investors, the potential upside is hard to ignore.",

So I\u2019m left with around 8k dollars.\n\nShe\u2019s a struggling artist and not the most enthusiastic person in the world about finance and stocks, we\u2019ve came across my investments & newest tech things going on a few times before in years, but she never bother to learn or show any kind of interest in this. \n\nSo she knows the loss porn and shit going on here (not exactly this sub tho), she\u2019s letting me do with the 8k the same way I do with my money, cause I\u2019ve earned over 300% this year. \n\nMy plan with this 8k is to avoid option tradings or shorting anything, stick with shares only, now I\u2019m gonna go all in to the GOOG. \n\nPs I want to impress the lady cause I\u2019ve always talk about techs and company capital gains and shit, I\u2019m not trying to marry her ( we discussed bout that indeed). \n\nWish me luck you regards! \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nShe leant somehow I\u2019ve been doing good this year and she texted me yesterday about investing for her, I said yes and then received the transaction, it\u2019s pretty much all of her savings for the last 3 years. \n\nWe didn\u2019t say how long should do this for her, so I guess it\u2019s a year max. Plus she doesn\u2019t know ANYTHING about stock or options trading whatsoever.\n\nThe question is do I buy week calls to gamble the money up or play it safe like buying some BRK shares? \n\nI kinda want to leave a good impression on her.

Criminally Low P/E Ratio\n\nWhile all your other tech darlings are flexing P/E ratios like a hooker in heat, $GOOGL is at 23.4 P/E ratio.\n\nFor reference:\n* $SPX: >27 P/E (yes, the S&P500)\n* $MSFT: >36 P/E\n* $AAPL: >39 P/E\n* $NVDA: >56 P/E\n* $AMZN: >47 P/E\n* $TSLA: >106 P/E (Fuck you, for the window lickers in the back)\n\nRemember a \u201cgood\u201d P/E ratio is traditionally around 20-25.

Google owns 90%+ of search traffic (when did you ever hear \u201cyahoo it\u201d or \u201cask duck duck go\u201d?) and monetizes it like a legal cartel. Once Gemini (+Legacy Bard) gets some improvements and a little lipstick even MORE money. Oh, and don\u2019t forget Google Cloud, which grew revenues 30% YoY last quarter.\n\n3.

With $GOOG\u2019s recent earnings beat ($28.5B in 3 months), the market\u2019s about to price this in as snow starts falling.\n\n4. Big Tech = Safe Haven\n\nRecession? Inflation? Global chaos?

    "selftext": "[The Fruitcake Portfolio v.1](https://preview.redd.it/i2yojf3sfd3e1.png?width=1266&format=png&auto=webp&s=636529c7950cdddd488f20aff86f74aef67ed951)\n\nGreetings my friends, and prepare yourselves. Join me as we learn the wey of gey.\n\nWhat you see before your very eyes is an experimental portfolio I have made. No real money is involved, but essentially this is a watchlist on E\\*Trade with share quantities assigned to each stock to fit my hypothetical allocations.\n\nThe purpose of this portfolio--gey.\n\nBy tilting heavily to the gey factor, we hope to realize the rawdog premium.\n\nThe core of this portfolio is Grindr (GRND). It holds a 27% allocation (I had to convince myself to not make it 30% for diversification's sake, although such is still not off the table entirely). The path of gey is risky, but potentially rewarding. Grindr holds what many consider to be somewhat of a monopoly on the LGBTQ+ dating and hookup market. Only the individual who achieves great wealth from Grindr stock can become a true Lord of the Gey.\n\nThe other stocks that makeup The Fruitcake Portfolio are stocks that one might consider to be gey-in-some-wey. In reality, this means we must invest in stocks typically designated \"women\" stocks. Now personally, I love stocks of companies whose target audience is women. Just because the product isn't some sci-fi tech robot A.I. missile etc etc, doesn't mean that it isn't a good company with amazing potential. I personally already own ELF and \\[redacted\\] in my real accounts. However, in this portfolio, beauty, cosmetics, and baby/household care products (diapers, etc) make up around 26% in total (17% for ELF, 9% for \\[redacted\\]).\n\nHims & Hers (HIMS) was selected for it's exposure to the men's sexual health market. They got ED pills, condoms, lube, prostate massagers, cock rings, etc. With the addition of a 10% HIMS allocation, The Fruitcake Portfolio will be on all fours, back arched, with its cheeks up in the air for exposure to the chode of this lucrative industry. In addition to HIMS, there is also a small 2% allocation to Church & Dwight (CHD), because they make Trojan condoms.\n\nFBTC is the Fidelity BitCoin ETF. This is the only crypto play in the portfolio and makes up 10% of the portfolio.\n\nIf Warren Buffet has Coca Cola (KO), then The Fruitcake Portfolio has Starbucks (SBUX), because Starbucks is zesty, and therefore, perfectly suited, as those who regularly drink from Starbucks follow the wey of gey. Similarly, Cheesecake Factory (CAKE) is more of a growthy-value stability stock in the restaurant sector. I wanted to originally find a vegan or vegetarian stock, however those tend to fail. However, CAKE actually has been expanding its business lately with the restaurant Flower Child. Flower Child serves vegan, vegetarian, paleo dishes, and more. So yes, CAKE is a bit of a compromise pick, but I think it fulfills the requirement of gey.\n\nThere is an 11% allocation split between Victoria's Secret (VSCO), Lululemon (LULU), and Nike (NKE). Overall, this is more of a value play and a smaller weight. VSCO is the primary holding here.\n\nDisney (DIS) and Netflix (NFLX) are tiny allocations to streaming services. Need I explain why they are perfect for\u00a0The Fruitcake Portfolio? If you are a 35 year old male millennial, and you still visit Mickey Mouse every year and take pictures with Cinderella, then you are no novice to the wey of gey.\n\nFinally, we have a tiny 1% allocation to Google (GOOG). Literally the alphabet company.\n\nSomething interesting to note is that this portfolio actually tilts very heavily into midcaps. Once ELF becomes a large cap, then things will be more balanced. I\u2019ve considered adding a SCV as well.\n\n\\----------------\n\nFor stocks and ETFS that didn't make the cut, I had:\n\nTSLA & FSLR: The wey of gey is partial to EVs and clean energy.\n\nVEGN: Basically a cruelty-free S&P 500. Considered including this and removing a bunch of the large cap stocks in the portfolio.\n\n\\[redacted\\]: An OTC Malaysian stock that I could probably buy through interactive broker. It's particularly NSFW.\n\n\\[redacted\\]: Weed Stocks.\n\nTGT: Target is Target.\n\nBBWI: Bath and Bodyworks for scented candles and slippery bathtub moments--with bubbles (ofc).\n\nRVLV: Clothing Retailer.\n\n\\----------------\n\nIf anyone has any ideas of how they might improve this portfolio, feel free to let me know. Any interesting stocks that you think might fit well in the mix? Would you swap out anything?\n\nI plan to track this portfolio's performance. I'm thinking I'll actually buy Grindr shares next week.",

    "selftext": "With Google under pressure from the DOJ, this looks like a huge potential for Opera. If Google was forced to sell Chrome, this would give smaller browsers, like Opera, a great chance to gain some market share. Also, when you look at browsers, excluding Edge and Firefox, Opera has a pretty substantial user base by comparison. They are also one of the only \"browser stocks\" that there are. At least the only one of any substance.\n\nOn the flip side, even if Google ISN'T forced to sell Chrome, then we should see the momentum continue for GOOG.\n\nI\u2019ve been a long term holder of OPRA for this very reason. They have a steady growing base of 350M users and are continuing to buy up smaller browser companies. I\u2019ve always looked at OPRA as a hedge against GOOG, at least as far as their browser is concerned. It also pays to hold because they have a great divided.\n\nI\u2019ve been a long term holder of GOOG too though. I think both are great companies, but I\u2019m buying both to more or less hedge my bets.\n\nI think OPRA has a strong chance of seeing some gains if DOJ does follow through.\n\nPositions: GOOG: 6 shares OPRA: 100 shares\n\n**TLDR**: Opera (OPRA) and GOOG (Alphabet) look like great buys right now.",

Now I'm seeing the same thing with Crocs. People don\u2019t care that they look like shit anymore; they think it's fashion now. You know those charms you put in the holes of Crocs? Every kid wants them these days. They don\u2019t realize you can get the exact same charms from China for 5% of the price. That\u2019s what I did, and I\u2019ve been rocking the same Crocs for 6 years now. Those crocodiles know how to make shoes man...... Also McDonalds put mini Crocs toys in their happy meals. Expect green dildos.\n2. **PYPL -** PayPal is notorious for having big expectations but then underdelivering. Mfs are trading at a 52W high right now, really poised for a big correction. Apple pay, Google pay, Adyen, Stripe, Square\u2014they're all getting a slice of the cake now. Intel nana is praying for PayPal's downfall.

    "selftext": "The problem areas in the USA: --------------------------\n\n\\*- The Schiller PE is at a very high level.  Only higher in 2021 and the Dot Com bubble.  So stocks are highly expensive.\n\n\\*- ISM manufacturing index has been in contraction since mid 2022!  We are more of a service economy than a goods economy,  but still when you have stocks priced for perfection this isn't what you want happening if you are a bull.\n\n\\*-  World's #2 economy, China is no longer growing to the point that it can move the global needle.  That is, global sales growing to the point where a company's local USA sales declines are offset.  Additionally the trade war hampers both sides.\n\n\\*- The consumer's savings have dropped back to 2022 levels.\n\n\\*- NVidia's leadership of the gainers was not sustainable and my one man's opinion is because their valuation is ten times the cash in the bank of all of their AI customers.  You have price to sales of 10 for all the money your customers could possibly spend on anything AI that NVidia sells in the short term.  People have said on this point that future earnings will be available and that customers can go to a bank.  However, clearly the price is high when you compare to say MKS Instruments and Applied Materials.  AMAT has more cash in the bank than MKSI is worth.  AMAT is MKSI's biggest customer, having a disproportionately large percentage of its sales.  So this means that in the short term, there is monetary potential energy for MKSI without loans nor future earnings, but it is not the same potential energy for NVidia.  This is not a marketing of MKSI stock BTW.  I don't own any MKSI.  This point applies to NVidia's AI GPUs that certainly the average person is not affording.  So the cash on hand is from MSFT, GOOG, META, AMZN.\n\nGood areas: --------------------------------------\n\n\\*- Labor productivity is up consistently since Q3 2022.  one can see \n\ntradingeconomics dot com USA productivity\n\n\\*- Gasoline is lower than last year\n\n\\*- Retail sales are going fine, \\[ per  a recent NPR radio article \\]\n\nNuetral ----------------------------------------\n\n\\*- Labor force participation is not higher than Sept 2023.  No more sales growth from people returning to work.  Participation is up recently. tradingeconomics has this info.\n\n\\*- Consumer confidence is still down since January 2020.\n\nMy one man's take ----------------\n\nThe problem areas are serious.  There is enough weight in the bear issues to cause the stock market to give up most of its gains this year.",

    "title": "The next tech giant. Why $HOOD, $PLTR and $DKNG are the investment opportunities of a lifetime. (Part 1)",
    "selftext": "I believe the story of the last 20 years of stock market is that one tech startup can disrupt an entire sector and join the tech giant club. For many sectors, information is king and turns out a company with a few 1000 people who have studied the science of information can outperform millions of people who aren't so scientifically rigorous. Now some sectors are not so prone to be disrupted by these information science experts. And if you asked me 20 years ago which sectors will be disrupted in what order, I would've guessed wrong.\n\n$AMZN Turns out the value of millions of retail stores across the west was not in their inventory, their brand or their location. Amazon proved their value was in knowing who wants what item when and where. Information. How can millions of retail shop compete with amazon when they already have my payment information (how) my location (where) and all amazon has to figure out is what do I want, which I'm happy to tell them by typing one word or expression in a search bar instead of walking around Home Depot trying to find a employee who's not too busy and has every reason to avoid me. Sentences and social interactions just can't compete with 1s and 0s. Now I wish I figured this all out 20 years ago when amazon still a great investment opportunity, but how could I have known Jeff would overcome all the hurdles by building this impossible network of warehouses and delivery. I won't make the same mistake twice.\n\n$NFLX (movies). $SPOT (music) $GOOG,$META(ads, communication, media), $AAPL, $MSFT etc... These are 100% information sectors that I would've guessed would be disrupted. But these were winner takes all. How could I know Facebook wouldn't fail like MySpace and Friendster? That iphones would be better than blackberry and nokia? How could I know Yahoo would become a total failure when they had such a commanding lead in the early internet era. These stocks will keep going up but they're not the 100 baggers they once were.\n\nAnd so in true\u00a0wsb\u00a0fashion, the question becomes, what tech startup is poised to do the same thing to their respective sector. Let's assume no company can be worth over $5T in the next 10 years. We need a company worth less than $50B whose sector is still ripe for the taking, and whose in the business of information. A sector whose legal hurdles have kept the incumbents safe from the efficiency of tech startups. A sector who created legal barriers that could resist a decade longer than taxi drivers could resist $Uber, or hotels vs $ABNB.\n\nThere are 3 answers : Finance, defense and gambling. These sectors have the highest barrier to entry of any. Their regulatory agencies are basically just a revolving door between government and industry. They are the most regulated sectors out there but they are finally starting to crack. Crony capitalism only works for so long.\n\nFrom a pure computer science perspective, overtaking these sectors is not technical challenge, in the same way Unity is failing at becoming the universal game engine. There's no legal barrier to become a game engine. Activison, Take two interactive, Ubisoft, etc.. everyone wants $U to succeed but they're now years behind on their promised revolutionary Data oriented technology stack. Everyone wants $TSLA Full self driving to succeed, but they're years behind Musk's first promises of success by what? 2017?. But those are technically hard challenges, maybe impossible with current hardware limitations. Now if you want to bet on their success, good luck to you but I'm not interested in those investments. Only someone at the cutting-edge of those technologies can make well-informed decisions. Only someone at the cutting-edge of semi conducters could've guessed $NVDA would obliterate intel and amd. I won't pretend to have any such knowledge about the future as I make these observations about the past. This is not what this tech investment thesis is about.\n\nAnd so in conclusion, three stocks stand out in their positioning and the state of their respective industry :\n\nIf you are under 40 years old, $HOOD (Finance), $PLTR (Defense) and $DKNG (gambling) will 100x during your investment horizon. Part 2 tomorrow as I dive deeper on all 3.",

    "selftext": "The overwhelming sentiment I see here and from financial analysts regarding AI is that it's this hugely speculative new tech that has yet to yield any substantive fruit. \"What's the use case?\" \"Where are the giant growth numbers?\"\n\nAnd yet, in the early days of using generative AI, if the low-hanging fruit is simply increases in efficiency and easy-to-automate processes being automated, what we'd expect to see is not ballooning growth, but similar productivity with fewer human workers, wouldn't we? And don't the numbers support exactly that?\n\nThe sector with the [highest unemployment rate is IT](https://www.statista.com/statistics/217787/unemployment-rate-in-the-united-states-by-industry-and-class-of-worker/).\n\nFrom the newest [Jobs Report](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm):\n\n>Employment continued to trend up in health care, in construction, and in transportation and warehousing, **while information lost jobs**.\n\nThere are other possible explanations for this trend. There could still be a surplus of IT workers even with high demand. Tech companies over-hired.\n\nBut a completely consistent narrative that many people seem to be ignoring is that the payoff from AI investment is already happening in the form of significant efficiency gains in the IT sector.\n\nTake [Meta's recent earnings call](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/31/meta-advertising-growth-proof-that-hefty-ai-spending-is-paying-off.html).\n\n>After the company\u2019s better-than-expected\u00a0[second-quarter earnings report](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/31/meta-earnings-q2-2024.html)\u00a0on Wednesday, Zuckerberg and finance chief Susan Li rattled off all the ways that AI has helped the company grow faster than the competition in the digital advertising market, Meta\u2019s core business.\n\n\u201cThe ways that it\u2019s improving recommendations and helping people find better content, as well as making the advertising experiences more effective, I think there\u2019s a lot of upside there,\u201d Zuckerberg said on the earnings call. \u201cThose are already products that are at scale. The AI work that we\u2019re doing is going to improve that.\u201d\n\nand\n\n>Meta reported revenue growth of 22% from a year earlier to $39.07 billion, with 98% of its sales coming from advertising, primarily on Facebook and Instagram. **Its growth rate was double that of Google\u2019s ad business**\n\nNow Zuck could be full of shit, and the increase is not attributable to AI, but to other factors. Or. Or. He's correct, and Meta has already done a very good job of figuring out how to leverage AI to increase profits, even after multiple rounds of layoffs in the last few years.\n\nGotta admit, the last couple of weeks have been scary. And I'm not 100% on this thesis (I'm sure many of you will find joy in poking holes in it). But I'm still predominantly bullish on AI. Not just as a long-term play, but as a near and long term play. I've still got 2/3rds of my stocks in NVDA/AMZN/GOOG/MSFT, with a handful of calls on these stocks and META with expiries 1-2 months out.\n\nTLDR: Declining jobs numbers, especially in IT, are completely consistent with what we'd expect to see if AI investment was already starting to pay off. Bears should maybe mull this over instead of screaming 'AI BUBBLE' every fucking chance they get.",

Small/Mid caps stagnant. for the first quarter you could make bank - i made 30k through march and withdrew that shit to pay for my kids school.\n\nApril 2024: I am now a reformed bear continuing bull strategy from the first 6 weeks: S\\*P drop 5.4% through April 19 - higher than expected inflation date. Push rates higher, lower # of anticipated rate cuts.  I got hammered trying the same call strategy. Gave away 15k if not more.\n\nMay 2024: AI AI AI every time you say AI in your earnings call the price goes up $1. S&P up 5.96%\n\nJune 2024: News Report: tech doesn't even need a rate cut to continue the bull run. June 12 $AAPL says \"APPLE INTELLIGENCE\", reaches all time highs. (puts for their earnings btw). $NVDA 140% for the year? After last year we were like WTF how is this 300 a share let alone 1400 a share in June.\n\nJuly 2024 $GOOG $AMZN up \\~80-100% for the year.\n\nLook, its logical to take profits. No shame in that especially for retail who loses out 90% of the time.\n\nJuly 2024: Rate cuts like 99.999% almost certain for sept. Now suddenly Small/Mid caps rally in a massive sector rotation. $SPX/$NDX tanks. Next week:  1T outflows. Then they pump and dump the russel up 12% to 2022 highs and then sell off for a quick 6% while everyones FOMOing into $RUT. Maybe more like RUT RO!!!! I Fomo'd last of dry powder MOnday but after earnings I'm turning bearish.  Tomorrow 5k realized loss for me or hold to 0.\n\nToo hard to beat the street. Profit taking, buying million dollar real estate with cash like smart investors do. Sit on the sidelines and let it bleed. But here we are still FOMO'ing calls and short dated puts that would only print 1/1000 times.\n\nOver the past few days 3 mag 7 earnings all tanked and here we are.\n\nAMD? CPUs Good for gamers and graphics cards for poors. Pennies compared to $NVDA. $NVDA has a monopoly on AI software like $ASML has a monopoly on lithography and $TSM has a monopoly on chip production.  $TSLA obviously seemingly doomed. Google can't take your cookies anymore, advertising revenue down MoM. Wanna get cucked by the zuck?  I'm tempted to donate $1 to people wanting to buy $META calls at this point.\n\nTLDR: This looks like the same pattern we have had in 2022 and 2023 when markets take a downturn through mid-late October.   Look at the previous years. I posted last week about the last 4 septembers being red. It looks like we are in another downturn. Earnings indicates it. I don't think CPI and PCE will save us this week.\n\nI'm scrounging up 25k waiting for the correction / dip / crash and buying SHARES so i never waste so much of my lifetime just to lose money speculating with options. Will post my realized losses if you think I'm BS.\n\nThanks for reading this or just the TLDR. Looking forward to discussion!",

TSMC is slipping up and lagging in high-NA EUV. In 2-3 years, Intel's foundry business will be dominating.\n\n\ud83d\ude80 The Catalyst: Intel's Foundry Push\n\n- **TSMC's Slip-Up**: TSMC is behind on high-NA EUV tech, opening a huge window for Intel.\n- **Intel's Timeline**: Expect Intel to capitalize on this in the next 2-3 years, becoming the top choice for chip manufacturing.\n\n\ud83d\ude80 One API and Gaudi 3: The CUDA Killer\n\n- **One API Rollout**: Intel\u2019s One API, supported by big names like GOOG, Arm, Qcomm, and Samsung, is set to dethrone NVDA\u2019s CUDA.\n- **Gaudi 3 vs H100**: Intel\u2019s Gaudi 3 will outperform NVDA's H100, making Intel the new favorite for AI acceleration and datacenters.\n- **CUDA\u2019s Weakness**: NVDA's market share is heavily reliant on CUDA. Once One API is fully rolled out, NVDA's grip on the market will loosen.\n\n\ud83d\ude80 Competitive Advantage: Software Over Hardware\n\n- **The Software Edge**: While anyone can build a good GPU, the real money is in the software ecosystem.

    "selftext": "I think TSLA might be (or become) the American Honda. Good products, occasionally cool stuff - and a name everyone knows.\n\nI think TSLA will eventually be something like Honda. Tesla is American, born and supported in primarily in the US.\n\nHonda is a great company. They make lots of great products. Honda makes vehicles, cars, aircraft, motorcycles, boat motors, lawn mowers, and a Robot (ASIMO the humanoid robot) and a motor that competes well in Formula-1 racing. So, I see parallels to TSLA.\n\nTesla has great products: Vehicles, Solar and battery products, and charging. Eventually maybe taxis that drive themselves and/or a robot.\n\nThat said, adoption can be slow and competition is often stiff. Tesla will do a good job of competition, but I can't see where they have a monopoly or even close. Even if Cathie Wood bases her TSLA predictions on monopoly or near cornered market estimates.\n\nI read on this reddit and post reply here and there.\n\nI have small put options on both TSLA. I think the auto industry is headed for a slower clip in the near future.\n\nI maintain that TSLA will be priced like a car company with some tech in the mix. Like Honda, but with more automation. Clearly with the number of people being cut from the company management knows things are slowing down. My opinion leans on the P/E ratio. The S&P 500 P/E ratio has roughly been between 15 and 25 for the last 15 years. I think TSLA is headed for a 25-35 x P/E. It is where tech some companies which make things are sitting. AAPL 28x, MSFT 35x, GOOG 26x, META 26x, TM (Toyota) is at 10x, Honda is at about 9x or 10x. TSLA is a vehicle company right now. The charging stations are a real business that seems to have longevity. And I think down the road TSLA will have material products for automation. The automatons \u2013 cars and robots are neat, but having a real product for market seems way off. And TSLA won\u2019t be the only one.\n\nReal products to market have often been slow to Musk and TSLA. Musk said the Cybertruck would go into production in late 2021 back when the vehicle was revealed in 2019. A small number of deliveries were made in late 2023. This was 4 to 5 years after announced. It is clear that planned products do happen, but often years after announced.\n\nAs the markets where TSLA has products become more mature, the growth prospects for the company become smaller. Sure TSLA could release a windmill, robot, something closer to real FSD, or Model X that tweets various videos of things that happen while driving, but things look like TSLA is maturing. Right now things are pivoting to a more stable and mature TSLA. And with a new product maybe it gets into the 40s maybe even the 50s. But this good company looks like the stock is overvalued. For my investments, I see TSLA headed to a PE between 25 and 35. And I think its going to get there this year and stay in that range for a while. The market had it there a few weeks back, and not much has changed other than job cuts.",

    "title": "Why I'm getting AMZN calls for today's earnings",
    "selftext": "Amazon (AMZN) is scheduled to report its fiscal Q1 2024 results **today.** I expect amazon to do well today on both earnings and revenues, and I'll explain why here. The company outperformed the street expectations in the last quarter, with net revenues increasing by 14% to $170 billion. It was driven by a 13% rise in the North America and Amazon web services segments, followed by a 17% gain in the International division. We expect the first quarter result to follow the same trend. I also am anticipating Amazon will release a dividend like META and GOOG, which I'll go into a lot of detail later. \n\nLet's talk about AMZN's ride over the past few years\u2014it's been a bit of a roller coaster, especially when you stack it up against the S&P 500. Back in early 2021, AMZN was hovering around $165. Fast forward to now, and it's ticked up to about $180. Sounds decent, right? But hold up, because that's nothing compared to the S&P, which has shot up by roughly 35% in the same period.\n\nLooking at the yearly breakdown: AMZN only inched up by 2% in 2021, then took a massive 50% dive in 2022, but bounced back hard with an 81% surge in 2023. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 had its own drama but less extreme, posting a 27% gain in 2021, dropping 19% in 2022, and climbing back up by 24% in 2023.\n\nThe takeaway? While AMZN did outperform the S&P in 2023, it lagged behind in the previous years. And this isn't just an AMZN thing\u2014other big names in the Consumer Discretionary sector like TSLA, TM, and HD, and even tech giants like GOOG, MSFT, and AAPL have also found it tough to consistently beat the S&P, in both up and down markets. So, what's next for AMZN? Let's keep our eyes peeled for their upcoming earnings report.\n\n# Revenue Beat\n\nAmazon\u2019s revenues grew 12% y-o-y to $574.8 billion in FY2023. All major categories posted growth in the year \u2013 online stores (5%), physical stores (6%), third-party seller services (19%), subscription services (14%), advertising services (24%), and AWS (13%). We expect the same trend to continue in Q1. Overall, we forecast Amazon\u2019s revenues to touch $641.4 billion for the full-year 2024.\n\n# EPS Beat \n\nAmazon Q1 2024 adjusted earnings per share is expected to be $0.85 per Trefis analysis, 2% above the consensus estimate of $0.83. The adjusted net income increased from -$2.7 billion to $30.4 billion in FY 2023. It was primarily because of lower operating expenses as a % of revenues, higher revenues, and a significant jump in the total non-operating income from -$18.2 billion to $705 million. Notably, the non-operating income was down in 2022 due to a marketable equity securities valuation loss. Further, the same trend was witnessed in Q4 2023. We expect the Q1 results to be on similar lines. Overall, Amazon is likely to report an annual GAAP EPS of $4.12 and revenue per share of $61.48 for the full-year 2024.\n\n# Possible Dividend Announcement\n\nMeta threw out its first dividend this March, and Google's parent company Alphabet isn't far behind, announcing a 20 cent dividend set for mid-June. This leaves us wondering about Amazon\u2014when are they joining the dividend party?\n\nBy the numbers, it seems like it\u2019s about time Amazon starts giving back some quarterly cash to its shareholders. Over the last decade, Amazon has racked up a cool $90 billion in free cash flow. Out of that giant pot, it only used about $6 billion for share buybacks in 2022, which is roughly a 7% capital return.\n\nIn comparison, other trillion-dollar behemoths have been way more generous, returning about 75% of their free cash flow over the past year\u2014though most of that was through share repurchases rather than dividends. Together, these non-Amazon trillion-dollar companies generated around $323 billion in cash flow over the last year, paid out $38 billion in dividends, and snapped up about $240 billion in their own stock.\n\nFor Amazon, cash flow isn't the issue. Wall Street's looking at a projected free cash flow of about $62 billion for 2024, which is expected to jump to $82 billion by 2025, per Bloomberg. So, the big question remains: when will Amazon start sending some of that cash flow back to shareholders in the form of dividends? Let's stay tuned and see if they'll open up their wallet.\n\nBut what would this look like? If Amazon decided to payout 75% of its projected 2024 free cash flow, we're talking about a dividend yield of around 2.4%. That actually beats the average 2.2% yield from other dividend-paying companies in the S&P.\n\nThis 2.4% isn't just dividends\u2014it includes any buybacks Amazon might throw into the mix. To give you a benchmark, the total shareholder yield for S&P 500 dividend payers has been about 3.3% over the past year. With Amazon\u2019s hefty cash flow, it\u2019s looking more and more like they\u2019re due to start sharing the wealth.\n\nJust for context, consider a bit of history. Microsoft went public back in 1986, and it took them 17 years and a revenue climb from less than $200 million to $32 billion before they started paying dividends in 2003. Since then, Microsoft\u2019s sales have been growing at a steady 10% yearly, with around $28 in dividends per share dished out to date. Fast forward to 2024, Microsoft\u2019s expected to hit sales around $260 billion.\n\nAmazon, on the other hand, went public in 1997 and has exploded from $600 million to nearly $600 billion in annual sales. With projections showing a growth rate of about 12% over the next few years, Amazon is well-positioned to both fuel further growth and start paying dividends.\n\nCurrently, Microsoft\u2019s stock yields about 0.8%. If Amazon wanted to match this, they\u2019d need to allocate roughly 20% of their forecasted free cash flow for the next two years to dividends\u2014totally doable since S&P 500 dividend payers typically spend about half their free cash flow on dividends.\n\nBottom line: Amazon doesn\u2019t need to aim for a 0.8% yield right off the bat. Kicking things off with literally any dividend would be a solid move. And if they do so, the stock will PUMP. This is why I'm getting calls for earnings. A call spread would be good, for those who can't get a call spread, AMZN 5/3 190c @ 3.20 doesn't look too bad. I'm picking 190c because the stock has *on average* moved about 7% up or down with earnings. A 7% push up today would bring the stock to about 192ish. Not enough for the calls to profit, so getting a call spread is deal. To do this, I'll just sell the 200c @ 1.19. So the cost of the whole position becomes 2.01/share. Not too bad. Good luck guys.",

    "selftext": "I've been an active investor in ETFs and individual stocks since graduating college in 2010. I've tried a little bit of everything and learned a lot (from good investments and some really bad ones) along the way. I've done broad market ETFs, sector ETFs, leveraged ETFs, commodity ETNs, penny stocks, risky biotech stocks that \\*might\\* go to the moon but will probably get pink slipped, solid large cap stocks, memestocks, option spreads, option calls and puts. etc... It's been a wild ride and I've learned a lot. While I made a lot of bad investments, I am grateful that I didn't do anything too reckless and only gambled a little bit of my money on insane ideas.\n\nOverall my portfolio has done well in the past 14 years so I feel like I made money while going to school. I made a few really good large investments in large cap ETFs and a few companies that have done extremely well (NVDA, ANET, META, CYBR, BRK/B) But now it's time to simplify.\n\nNow I am applying all those lessons learned to update my portfolio holdings to just the ETFs and companies I believe in for the long term. At the end of last year I had a lot of random little investments in all kinds of companies and ETFs and it was just ridiculous. Over 60 individual company stocks and dozens of different ETFs. I took diversification to an extreme that just wasn't making a difference and holding me back due to opportunity cost.\n\nWhat I'm looking to do now is to sell off all the random ETFs and stocks that aren't my top picks. The famous saying from Warren Buffet about diversification I believe holds true about ETFs as well as individual companies. \"*If you can identify six wonderful businesses, that is all the diversification you need. And you will make a lot of money. And I can guarantee that going into a seventh one instead of putting more money into your first one is gotta be terrible mistake. Very few people have gotten rich on their seventh best idea. But a lot of people have gotten rich with their best idea.\"*\n\nNow I'm not nearly as good at evaluating companies as Warren Buffett. So my approach will be to identify my shortlist of favorite ETFs for long term growth as well as a few high conviction companies. I will consolidate my holdings into just these etfs / stocks.\n\nI've done a lot of research this is where I've landed. I will rebalance as needed to make sure i don't get overly concentrated.\n\nLarge Cap US S&P 500: VOO / SPLG\n\nDividend Growth: VIG\n\nLarge Cap Growth: SCHG\n\nMid Cap Growth: IMCG\n\nMid Cap Value: COWZ\n\nSmall Cap Value: CALF\n\nSemiconductors: SMH\n\nI'm also experimenting a little with GPIQ and SPHY for yield, but I'm more focused on growth than yield at this point.\n\nAs for individual stocks, my key holdings are:\n\nNVDA\n\nMETA\n\nGOOG\n\nBRK.B\n\nTSLA\n\nCYBR\n\nANET\n\nAVGO\n\nMSFT\n\nAMZN\n\nPLTR\n\nI realize this is very large cap growth / tech stock heavy... especially with some of my stock holdings also representing a significant weighting in the ETFs. But I am ok with this.I'm done with ETFs for REITS, Emerging Markets, International. In both good and bad economic environments since 2010 they don't typically provide outperformance and I would have been way better off just putting the money into a US S&P500 fund. I don't see any compelling reason to keep any money in these kind of funds anymore.I was looking for potential exposure to more small caps (esp growth) but I haven't found an ETF that is all that compelling in this space.\n\nCurious what feedback people have. Is there something big I'm missing by avoiding International and REITs? Am I too concentrated in large cap tech? Am I leaning way too much on good past performance of large caps? Are there any fantastic ETFs I should considering adding to my short list?\n\nFor years I tried to buy beat up sectors and stocks hoping they would outperform, but I've seen just the opposite. So my strategy now is to stay relatively diversified into ETFs / companies that have a history of consistent strong performance and strong business models.",

TFC and Zion expected earnings both to decline 26%. A good beat will be a healthy a sign.\n\nTuesday:  GE is expected to kill it with a 159% increase in earnings. It\u2019ll be interesting with forward guidance considering the big trouble at Boeing.  RTX is expected to be flat with earnings, but with the recent $95B military aid package passed, I would think amazing guidance.  TSLA - big day with expected earnings to be down 41%.  Elon needs to pull a rabbit out of the hat!\n\nWednesday: Durable Goods Orders  0.3% expected with the last report of 0.5%.  BA earnings are expected to further diminish by an additional negative 12.5%. Wonder if they plan to name the new CEO?  Big Daddy Meta to report with estimated earnings almost doubling to $4.36.  High bar!\n\nThursday:  GDP estimated 2.4% versus 3.4% yoy.  CAT estimates are earnings up 4%. I would think the Infrastructure Bill to kick in by now.  Microsoft earnings expected to be up 13.7 % - low bar they need to double back flip over it.  Then GOOG expected earnings up 22%.  The band on TikToc will be interesting on the price action for Google & Meta this week.  Big AMZN expected earnings down 17% low bar - I like Amazon. \n \nFriday:  The Fed\u2019s favorite PCE yoy estimated 0.3% -  flat compared to prior 0.3%.  Core PCE less food & energy 0.3% - again flat versus prior of 0.3.  \n\nIf your looking for action - here it comes.  I think TSLA\u2019s robo-taxi is science fiction- they are struggling with execution ie. Cyber truck. Inflation data will move the market if good or bad.  Is there another 5% down this week?

I said it will probably triple in a 2 years even at it's inflated price.\n\nhttps://np.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qw9glx/im_surprised_there_isnt_more_nvda_talk_before/\n\nI was playing golf at my club and guys who were 60+ on the tee box were talking nvda and smci and everything they said was wrong.  Then I walked into the restaurant to eat and again I heard the boomer pro talking about it. Funny thing was I remember him dogging on it when it was sub 200 having too high a PE\n\nI had a plan and my limit order sold at 900 awhile back but when my mom asked about NVDA I just had that sinking feeling like she asked my about my decentralized currency when it hit ath but my limit order had not filled .  I remember her asking about my currency around nov 2021 at thanksgiving which was literally the top, and again at thxgiving or christmas years prior in 2013 and 2017 she again called the top.\n\nBless her but my mom and boomers have a way of warning about the top.\n\nEDIT: I just think it\u2019s way harder for a company like NVDA which owns 99% of datacenter GPU to keep that 99% and I already seeing AMD, QCOM, ARM, AMZN, MSFT, GOOG, Meta making their own and making in roads and chipping 1% here and there.  \n\nMuch like any IT person who worked in datacenters and colocations pre 2016 saw INTC own 99% of datacenter.  It was easy to see it\u2019s very hard to keep 99% and when you lose a few % the \u201cstreet\u201d or \u201cmarket\u201d pivots quickly.  \n\n5+ years ago I said AMD at $1.80 I said INTC would start shedding that 99% dominance.  \n\nhttps://np.reddit.com/r/AMD_Stock/comments/9v1n6f/amazon_web_services_aws_pricing_amd_vs_intel/e994dka/\n\nWhen you own 99% of the market imo once the pivot happens, it\u2019s almost like a landslide in stock price. And it moves in cycles, companies will buy a bunch of NVDA GPUs and they might add a little bit the next year or the year after but you won\u2019t have large purchases.  No one is buying 1 billion dollars of GPUs every year or quarter.  This business cycles and when it goes down it\u2019ll go down for 2 years and rocket up after when people need to bulk order.",

Here are some key projections:\n\n**CPI:**\n\n* CPI is likely to come in about 10 basis points under consensus expectations per my model.\n* Despite a hot jobs report and rising gas prices, productivity gains and a slowing pace of rent/rent equivalent increases will keep CPI in check.\n* This could put rate cuts back on the table.\n* If this thesis holds, expect the Russell 2000 (RUT) and Nasdaq-100 (QQQ) to rally.\n* Money draining from bonds to stocks this Wednesday.\n\n**Banks:**\n\n* JPM may kick off a bank rally.\n* If the inflation thesis holds, banks will start to look awfully cheap as earnings come through.\n\n**Tech Names:**\n\n* Not every stock will move up - track the fundamentals.\n* GOOG and AAPL are likely to outperform NVDA (this might be a hot take, but it doesn't say anything of long-term prospects, but the fact NVDA susceptible to some bumps, whereas AAPL negativity is peaking just as it has for GOOG).\n* META and NFLX looking pretty solid in the short term.\n* Look for unloved tech names that have been left behind due to the AI hype (e.g. AAPL).\n* Cybersecurity and IT services companies are expected to benefit.\n* Non-AI chip companies offer a safer downside play with potential upside.\n\n**Energy/Utilities:**\n\n* The oil sector is getting crowded, so target utilities and natural gas exposure instead.\n* A note on oil prices: $100 oil is not what it used to be.  US is relatively insulated from the negative impact due to its domestic production.  In fact, high oil and high stock markets can coexist.\n\n**Gold:**\n\n* Save yourselves, there are better plays. Goldbugs will not love this market into the year.  As inflation comes down, so will Gold.  Start taking the profits.\n\nThere may be some pockets to short, like Boeing or Tesla, but be cautious and use stop losses, as these names could get caught up in a broader market rally.

Because if this is correct, and now that we know they too are working on an AI...\n\nWhy not just stop selling chips?\n\nThat would cripple literally everyone else in the game and leave them as the ONLY company with proper AI technology for the next 5 or more years. That's a lifetime in AI terms. Not only that, but they can manufacture all the compute they need while doing so. Within 2 months they become the only company that can produce an AI worth using. Now they own 100% of the AI market with literally no competition in sight.\n\nThey win. GG.\n\nEdit: How is this getting so much hate? lol. Do you regards not get it??? Look, if NVDA is the only play in town, and they keep all the compute they make, they'll be able to develop their AI a lot faster than we've seen so far. We are talking AGI within 5 years max.

I also made stats for INTC's new GPU, but it didn't look as good, so I left them off.\n\nNVDA's high price/sales is justified by their huge margins -- 48% -- which they only have because competition has been non-existent. But that won't last, because they don't have a monopoly, TSMC has the monopoly. It isn't rocket science to run ML models on other GPUs, just nobody does because all non-NVDA chips suck (besides TPUs but GOOG is hoarding those because they didn't make enough of them). But anyone else can send TSMC a reasonable design and get their good GPU chip made, and AMD is finally going to do that. I don't know if it will help AMD, they seem richly valued themselves, but AMD over the decades, periodically sprung ahead in having the best offering in the CPU market over INTC and killed INTC's margins and crashed INTC's share price. AMD is about to do that to NVDA in GPUs.\n\nAlso I hear NVDA engineers have gone soft now they are all rich.",

    "selftext": "**tl;dr - Google is a bloodthirsty cash generation machine in the process of taking over the entire AI ecosystem, with a share price suppressed by misguided perceptions of wokeness along with short-term options positioning, against the backdrop of massive monetary stimulus during an election year. $GOOGL price target $270 by year end**\n\n$GOOGL has been down-and-out this year. While AI names like NVIDIA have been surging, GOOGL share price has looked like absolute garbage. Why? Well, Google was getting really shitty for awhile, too worried about policing whether we call something a \u201cmotherboard\u201d because its \u201csexist\u201d or something equally stupid.\n\n[GOOGL underperformance this year](https://preview.redd.it/x44acnzaftnc1.png?width=2172&format=png&auto=webp&s=5674992d779dfa56e17cede67cd3e1c9aa04a675)\n\nWell, **things have changed at the Goog**, and not only on the woke front. Google is positioned to dominate the world of AI, taking the piss out of OpenAI and NVIDIA and all the others. And the time to buy is now.\n\nGet in losers, we\u2019re going call shopping.\n\n# Google will bomb your grandmother to lock in another $1B revenue\n\nHave you heard of Project Nimbus? It\u2019s a project to help Israeli military surveillance. Google is the biggest service provider helping out.\n\nIf you haven\u2019t seen the video yet, here\u2019s a Google Cloud Platform engineer protesting a Google Israel exec before getting physically removed by security while the crowd boos him\n\n[https://twitter.com/car0linehaskins/status/1764681078206337434](https://twitter.com/car0linehaskins/status/1764681078206337434)\n\nNow, I\u2019m not a big fan of Israel and its slaughter of women and children in Gaza. But the point is that Google DGAF about that, they want to make bank. Google will help bomb your grandma\u2019s house for a billion dollars, and if you bitch about it, they\u2019ll literally put you in a chokehold and throw you out of the room. There are people like this guy inside Google protesting, but the show goes on\u2026 Google execs are happy to help and talk publicly about it.\n\nIt\u2019s a fat check and morals be damned, Google is not going to let a little genocide get in the way of their revenue.\n\nDoes this sounds woke to you?\n\nWell, there\u2019s more on the anti-woke agenda\u2026\n\n# Google will fire your wife\u2019s boyfriend to keep costs down\n\nGoogle not only DGAF about supporting war criminals. Google will also flout labor laws and its perception to organized labor by laying off a division live on TV in order to send a message that their bloodthirsty profit-making will not be challenged.\n\nHave you seen the video? Here\u2019s Youtube employees testifying in front of Austin City Council getting laid off live on air. Google is not the woke mob. Google is for better or worse destroying the woke mob live for you to see it.\n\n[https://twitter.com/peepaw\\_/status/1763376791861735583](https://twitter.com/peepaw_/status/1763376791861735583)\n\nThis of course comes well after a series of large layoffs back at Google HQ. I live in the SF bay area and have several friends who were around at the time. Many of these \u201cXooglers\u201d have speculated that Google management has detailed surveillance of employee activity, and used this data to prioritize who to get rid of.\n\nGoogle developed a (well deserved) reputation in recent years of being a place where lazy social activists dicked around and burned cash. The stock performance reflects this. But things turned around over the past year or so, and Google has trimmed the fat aggressively. This will become obvious to markets soon.\n\nGoogle isn\u2019t a woke playground for slackers, it\u2019s a bloodthirsty beast that will surveil staff to systematically remove the lazy, even firing your wife\u2019s boyfriend on live television to send a message.\n\n# Google\u2019s founders are heads down on AI\n\nOne more video to make the point about the attitude of Google top brass.\n\nHere\u2019s a tweet from some idiot who doesn\u2019t get it at all, posting a clip of Sergey Brin talking to a room of people including *the dude with the tits tshirt*. I don\u2019t know about you, but I personally would not want to spend a minute in this room of total dorks. I\u2019m sure it smells like shit.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t3sa680qftnc1.png?width=1010&format=png&auto=webp&s=1e7c5c6a3b3f6395a76e00349fc97f76ac7f9614\n\n[https://twitter.com/Daily\\_Memes\\_7/status/1764957234759647415](https://twitter.com/Daily_Memes_7/status/1764957234759647415)\n\nJesus, Sergey looks tired, **like he actually gives a fuck about making Gemini a success**. The important thing is, he\u2019s still out there working on Gemini, and even tolerating the horrible smell of incels to fix the shitty launch of Gemini\u2019s public product. I don\u2019t want some suits issuing press releases, I want the $1.7T market cap company founder still out there grinding.\n\nSpeaking of Gemini\u2026\n\n# Google Gemini will destroy OpenAI (and Micro$oft)\n\nForget about ChatGPT the product interface. The \u201cwoke\u201d problem with the public release of Gemini is a small speedbump on the long road to AI supremacy. The real long-term value of AI will be how companies can incorporate LLMs into tasks across the spectrum of business needs.\n\n*Have you heard of VertexAI?* It\u2019s one of the tools available in the Google Cloud suite, and it makes it easy to use models for more than \u201cjust another chat bot.\u201d VertexAI, powered by Gemini, already has surpassed OpenAI in functionality for varying business use cases.\n\nHere\u2019s an example. I work with a large multinational advertising company on data projects including AI use cases, and we\u2019re using VertexAI. Take as an example this [functionality on \u201cmultimodal embeddings\u201d](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/embeddings/get-multimodal-embeddings). You can pass it a few paragraphs of text, a few images, a few videos, and some audio recordings \u2013 and then easily use the resulting embeddings to do something like, \u201cWhat is the most similar video to this paragraph?\u201d This is the kind of stuff that real actual businesses will use to automate your job. **You probably won\u2019t even be able to get a job at Wendy\u2019s soon because of tools like this.**\n\nWe\u2019re using VertexAI instead of OpenAI because the functionality simply doesn\u2019t exist yet in OpenAI\u2019s suite. OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Meta\u2019s Llama, etc. are all great models and are quickly becoming commoditized, but meanwhile Google is building business capabilities around the models that will push AI customers into their cloud suite and entire stack of products.\n\nBTW, did you read the recently released [Elon letters to OpenAI](https://twitter.com/0interestrates/status/1765204521909887309)? In 2018 Elon was worried that Google would take over the world with their AI, including the DeepMind team which has arguably the best and highest paid AI staff in the world. Well, they haven\u2019t disappeared, and Google is still probably going to take over the world.\n\nBut, Gemini and DeepMind aren\u2019t the only Google assets relevant to the AI revolution.\n\n# Google is the only company that can beat NVIDIA\n\nLike NVIDIA, Google is also a \u201cfabless chipmaker.\u201d They make a device called a TPU which is like the GPUs built by NVIDIA except better for AI. They were specifically designed for AI use cases.\n\nDo you like NVIDIA? You like stonks that go up, right? Well, NVIDIA\u2019s GPUs are great, but the TPU produced by Google was especially made for AI use cases. Why aren\u2019t more companies using them, you may ask? Read for yourself on [this Hacker News thread](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39670121) \\- Google\u2019s not selling their TPUs except to a specific few [customers like Anthropic](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/google-announces-expansion-of-ai-partnership-with-anthropic-301981815.html), because their internal services (like VertexAI) are using near 100% of all the TPUs they\u2019ve currently produced. The time is coming soon where Google\u2019s TPU production will go beyond internal usage, but it hasn\u2019t come yet because they\u2019re too powerful to justify letting anyone else use them yet!\n\nYou can listen to this recent [Risk Biscuits podcast](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/interview-15-doug-olaughlin-from-fabricated-knowledge/id1722170364?i=1000648424701) featuring Fabricated Knowledge\u2019s Doug O\u2019Laughlin, an expert on the semiconductor industry, where he calls out Google as one of the only companies that could soon eat NVIDIA\u2019s lunch.\n\nBTW, Anthropic are the people who made Claude 3 - check out their [demo of Claude being an economic analyst](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjL6Gl6ZIqs). **Yes, regards, your econ degree is useless now too, because of Google.**\n\n# Google: the only company that owns the entire AI stack\n\nGod, this post is long, but it has to be because $GOOGL has a lot of shit to talk about to justify how it will print tendies for us. Let\u2019s make this one quick.\n\nGoogle is the one company that has the entire AI stack in-house. Let\u2019s review\n\n* **Hardware**: Google TPU is their own AI-specific hardware that will soon go head-to-head with NVIDIA\n* **Dev software**: They maintain TensorFlow, a tool for interacting at a low level with AI tech\n* **AI APIs**: VertexAI (as discussed)\n* **Infra**: Their Google Cloud Platform suite means customers can easily store, process, transform, and analyze data - seamlessly integrated with VertexAI and Gemini\n* **Data**: Google notoriously hoovers up a fuckton of data from all their products: Gmail, Search, Chrome to name a few. This is data they can use to easily train their models, data that competitors don\u2019t have access to.\n* **Monetization**: **Ads**\n\nWhich brings us to the Golden Goose of Google, online advertising.\n\n# Google: still untouchable king of online advertising\n\nGoogle makes an assload of cash from online advertising. They\u2019ve essentially created an ads monopoly, by buying up competitors in the programmatic display ad ecosystem, buying the highest-value Video ads publisher (Youtube), building the most popular email provider (Gmail), and of course, being by far the most popular search engine.\n\nThey\u2019re well on the way to making it effortless to turn a dial and instantly spend $100m across every advertising channel with their PerformanceMax advertising system. It\u2019s an AI-based (duh) system for using the advertiser\u2019s data and website to automatically build and serve Text, Display, Video, Audio ads across their ads monopoly.\n\nI was recently consulting with a large ecommerce brand. 85% of their ad spend was going to Google Shopping ads, because no matter how much they tested Bing, Meta, LinkedIn, etc., none of that shit worked like Google does. Google is the king.\n\n**Do you want to advertise to people looking for the specific products you\u2019re selling, or to people jerking off to autistic e-girls on their Instagram reels?** Hm, I wonder what performs better? Holy fuck.\n\n# Google AI advertising: Coming to PerformanceMax campaigns near you\n\nWe\u2019re almost done. The last point about AI + Ads is that there\u2019s a whole new channel for advertising coming soon: Generative AI advertising.\n\nHave you seen the little blurbs in Google Search results where Google uses AI to give answers to your search query? Obviously, soon enough, advertisers will pay to be directly injected into not just these blurbs, but all across the Gemini ecosystem.\n\nThink about it- You are Coca Cola. You spend $100m on Google to buy AI generation impressions. Now when Gemini creates text about people being thirsty or drinking something, CocaCola gets inserted into the response. **These responses go out not just through the Google search page but also through the VertexAI API calls that businesses are using across all \\*their\\* AI use cases**. Better yet, PerformanceMax will automatically allocate budget to this new AI advertising and track the performance of it along with all the rest of the ridiculous ad spend you\u2019re pushing through Google Ads. This hasn\u2019t been announced yet, but the writing is on the wall (or in the AI, or something). Will it be next earnings release? Not sure.\n\n# Google price is being held down by calls expiring this Friday\n\nWell, all this sounds great - but besides all the anti-wokeness pressure on the stock, why now?\n\nYou regards hopefully know about Cem Karsan and his options market expertise \u2013 if not then you should probably give up or just buy GOOGL calls and call it a day.\n\nLast week on this [Top Traders Unplugged podcast](https://www.toptradersunplugged.com/podcast/285-systematic-investor-series-ft-cem-karsan-march-2nd-2024/) Cem talked about how we\u2019re coming into a huge options expiry this Friday for the single name options. There\u2019s a large amount of open interest on big NASDAQ names like GOOGL that are suppressing stock price. As the OTM short calls held by MM\u2019s get close to expiry, the delta decays, meaning the MM\u2019s need to sell the underlying in order to stay hedged. While the AI names have been on a tear for the past month, the rest of the Mag7 has suffered because of this dynamic.\n\nWell, Friday\u2019s coming quickly. Will the lid come off so the non-NVIDIA Mag7 can return to greatness? Will the market realize that Google is a take-no-prisoners money printing machine who has systematically removed woke slackers from their ranks over the past year? We will see.\n\n# Google go up becus Jeo Boden\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m4ljfncqgtnc1.png?width=1704&format=png&auto=webp&s=074a852664ba33a4a9c60f2368099712faaeacbf\n\nFinally, in case you\u2019re living under a rock, it\u2019s worth reminding you that it\u2019s an election year and Powell won\u2019t be able to close the fucking door for long if he gets fired by Doland Tremp next year. Powell is going to stay loose with monetary policy, pumping up asset prices. Google is king, and the king is going to be drunk on liquidity this year.\n\nBuy GOOGL calls, all year\u2026 let the tendies flow\u2026\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# POSITION:\n\nOTM call strip Mar22-> Dec 140->210\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gtdt9whc26oc1.png?width=696&format=png&auto=webp&s=f58072b96214965719b0ed3483c81a0cf08fdbc7",

    "title": "Transocean ($RIG) for an early play on a seemingly undervalued yet stable company",
    "selftext": " Alright thrillseekers, sit down & strap-on for a wild ride.\n\nQuit staring at ur pecker and fix your gaze on Transocean ($RIG), a behemoth lurking in the depths of the offshore drilling sea. Now, I know what you're thinking - in the era where Elon musks up Mars missions, who's still betting on oil? Well, let me serve you a hot take straight from the financial trenches where the old-world black gold still fuels the very rockets we dream about.\n\nTransocean is one of the world's largest offshore drilling companies. They provide worldwide, rig-based well construction services with a fleet of mobile offshore drilling units, which are essentially massive floating platforms equipped with drilling rigs. These platforms can be moved to different locations in the ocean where oil and gas deposits are thought to be.\n\nThese rigs are not just behemoth vessels; they're the lifeblood of the energy sector, churning the depths for the oil that powers everything from your V8 engines to the V-shaped recoveries.\n\nTheir treasure chest? A backlog swelling to the tune of $9.01 billion. That's billion, with a B, earmarked for future escapades across the seven seas. And it's not just about the booty; it's about growth, baby. They're rolling out new rigs like Deepwater Titan - a titan by name and by nature, bristling with 20,000 psi blowout preventers that could squeeze the FOMO out of the staunchest bears.\n\nBut hold up\u2014before you mortgage the dog house to go all in, remember the market's a fickle mistress. Interest rates, green energy's siren call, and the ever-swinging pendulum of oil prices make for a voyage only the brave (or foolhardy) undertake. Yet, amidst this chaos, $RIG's crew keeps a steady hand on the tiller, backed by a fleet expansion, a focus on high-demand regions, and insider trades that scream \"All aboard!\"\n\n\\-\n\n**RIG THESIS:** A sizable backlog signals enduring demand in the energy sector, despite the ebb and flow of oil prices and the green wave. This old-school oil giant may wobble with market whims, but insider buying sprees and a hefty share repurchase program whisper confidence. $RIG's tale is one of classic industry muscle flexing in modern times, offering a blend of resilience and potential for those willing to drill deep into its prospects. As the lingering effects of post-post-post-modernism and rapid accusations of racism dwindle, the world is starting to wake up to the resilience of the traditional energy sector, for better or worse.\n\n\\-\n\n**Here's how they make money:**\n\n1. Contract Drilling: Oil and gas companies hire Transocean to drill wells for them. Transocean charges these companies a day rate, which is like paying rent for the use of their drilling rigs each day. The deeper and more complex the drilling, the higher the day rate can be...anywhere from $100,000 to $500,000 per DAY, often for months or years on a single project. Who wants to go in on a rig with me?\n2. Lease of Equipment and Crew: Along with their drilling rigs, Transocean provides the necessary equipment and a highly trained crew to operate the rigs and carry out the drilling operations.\n3. Long-Term Contracts: Many of their contracts are for extended periods, which provides a steady stream of income over time. This is because drilling projects can take several months or even years to complete.\n\n\\-\n\n**Elevating Factors:**\n\nFleet Expansion: Transocean has expanded its fleet, such as completing the construction of and placing into service the ultra-deepwater floater Deepwater Titan, indicating growth and an increased capacity for service offerings.\n\nPositive Contract Backlog: Transocean has a substantial contract backlog, which suggests a strong future revenue stream and stability in operations.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[ Increasing number of contracts means things are heating up and IMO people are going to switch their attention from 'green' to 'stable.' ](https://preview.redd.it/l32yl6w6eumc1.png?width=1051&format=png&auto=webp&s=6b1510f24cba3b2ace7cc190f9875cccb5f8fe2c)\n\nInvestments and Acquisitions: The company has made strategic investments, such as the acquisition of an equity ownership interest in Global Sea Mineral Resources NV, diversifying its portfolio and potentially opening up new revenue channels.\n\nIndustry-Leading Position: Transocean is a leading international provider of offshore contract drilling services, which could be beneficial in securing new contracts and maintaining a competitive edge.\n\nRobust Demand for Oil and Gas: There are forecasts that hydrocarbons will continue to be a significant source of energy, ensuring demand for offshore drilling services.\n\nFocus on High-Demand Regions: The company focuses on technically demanding sectors like ultra-deepwater and harsh environment drilling, which are in high demand.\n\nPositive Market Conditions: The offshore drilling market shows positive signs, with increased activity in ultra-deepwater and harsh environment sectors leading to improved tendering activity and contract terms.\n\nStrategic Rig Utilization: Transocean's strategic utilization of its rigs and resources aligns with the needs of its customers, which is crucial for maintaining high operational efficiency.\n\nInsider Purchases: Significant insider purchases indicate confidence in the company's future from those with in-depth knowledge of the company.\n\n\\-\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[ In the chart, you can see the prices of petroleum is going up month over month YTD.

Moreover, the moderating inflation with expectations to fall to 5.8 percent in 2024 and further to 4.4 percent in 2025, due to elevated central bank rates fighting inflation and unwinding supply-side issues, suggests an improving economic backdrop. This environment can be conducive to energy demand stability or growth, potentially benefiting companies in the oil and gas sector, including Transocean ($RIG), as steady economic growth typically correlates with higher energy consumption.\n\nThey've also had a significant increase in contract drilling revenues due to higher average daily revenues and the addition of new ultra-deepwater floaters. It also indicates increased costs related to reactivation and contract preparation, inflation impacts on personnel, and maintenance costs.\n\nWhile there are challenges and market risks, Transocean is poised to capitalize on the continued demand for offshore drilling, backed by a strong backlog and a capable fleet.\n\nThe team at $RIG has been in the game for a while. They have deep industry knowledge with a range of experiences both within Transocean and other leading firms in the oil and gas sector. Their collective expertise spans operations, finance, legal, administrative, and information technology, positioning them to navigate the company through the dynamic energy market.\n\nIn addition, significant purchases made by directors or entities associated with the company with large quantities, suggesting confidence in the company's future prospects. The consistent buying pattern from what seems to be a major stakeholder or related party (Perestroika (Cyprus) Ltd) could be perceived as a positive signal to the market.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Insider buying massively outweighs sales. Two recent large purchases at the top, just one week ago. Things are heating up!](https://preview.redd.it/1bdvclzweumc1.png?width=1855&format=png&auto=webp&s=663897805a4a8deff0a0baa0a340d1b45f6d5360)\n\nIssuer Purchases of Equity Securities: The existence of a share repurchase program with a significant amount of authorized repurchase amount remaining suggests a positive view from management regarding the company\u2019s valuation, which can be seen as elevating.\n\n\\-\n\n**Industry elevating factors include:**\n\nThe rising markets. Monetary loosening. And the global demand.\n\nDiesel & Propane: Inventory levels are slimming down, which might point to a surge in consumption or a drop in production. Either way, it's a sign that the market dynamics could be shifting.\n\nRefineries: There's a noticeable ramp-up in crude processing, hinting at a solid bet on sustained or rising fuel demand.\n\nExports: Our export game is stronger than before, signaling robust international demand for our energy products.\n\nImports vs. Exports: The landscape's changing \u2013 we're becoming a net energy supplier to the world, leaning more on what we produce domestically and less on what we bring in from abroa\n\n\\-\n\n**Neutral Factors:**\n\nCrude Oil: Little uptick in stocks this week, but we're running leaner than last year. Could mean we're using up the stash but still got some ways to go.\n\nGasoline: Took a small hit this week, but nothing crazy. Year-over-year, we're basically chilling.\n\nLegal and Regulatory Matters: Transocean is involved in various legal proceedings, regulatory matters, disputes, and claims, including those related to alleged violations of environmental regulations. While the company does not expect these to materially impact its financial position, the uncertainty of litigation outcomes remains a risk.\n\nFinancial Position Stability: The balance sheets, equity statements, and cash flow statements highlight a company navigating through its operational and financial challenges with a degree of stability in its overall financial position.\n\n\\-\n\n**Depricating (Bad) Factors:**\n\n$RIG's ride is looking a bit bumpy. Oil and gas prices are wilding, and when they drop, $RIG feels the burn. We're tangled up with OPEC's mood swings and non-OPEC's pumping game. Plus, the green energy trend and tech upgrades are still the cool kids that could sideline the play. So keep an eye on renewable / clean energy, EV, and big tech with renewaable energy initiatives. (ICLN, FAN, TAN, NEE, VWS, SEDG, PLUG, GOOG, AAPL, XLE)\n\nFinancial Performance: The company reported significant net losses, an increase in operating losses, and an accumulated deficit over the years, indicating challenges in profitability and financial stability. I believe this may be actually an elevating factor in the sense that it's undervalued and overlooked.\n\nOperational Challenges: The company faces operational challenges, including maintaining compliance with environmental regulations and managing administrative monitoring and reporting obligations related to the Clean Water Act National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit. But they handlin' em.\n\nPotential for Material Impact from Unpredictable Outcomes: While the company believes that the ongoing legal matters and regulatory issues will not materially affect its financial position, there's no guarantee that this will be the case. The unpredictable nature of these matters could potentially lead to adverse financial impacts. Stay plugged into their news and filings to make sure nothing pops up.\n\nTaking these factors together, the overall impact of these legal, regulatory, and tax matters on Transocean Ltd. can be considered neutral to slightly elevating. The term \"elevating\" is used cautiously here, primarily due to the resolution of the Clean Water Act violation in a manner that does not materially impact the company's financial position or operations. The description suggests that while challenges exist, the company has processes in place to manage and resolve these issues effectively, which is a positive indicator of its operational resilience and compliance efforts.\n\n\\-\n\n**TL;DR & Conclusion:**\n\nTransocean ($RIG), the ocean's mighty titan of offshore drilling, is playing a long game in the energy sector's stormy seas. With a colossal $9.01 billion backlog and shiny new rigs like the Deepwater Titan joining the fleet, they're all set for a deep dive into the ocean's lucrative trenches.\n\nThe crew's stacked with industry vets who've weathered every storm, and their ledger is a testament to resilience, with potential upsides that the savvy investor might just find too tempting to pass up.\n\nSo, whether you're a die-hard oil fan or a thrill-seeker looking for the next big wave, keep a weather eye on $RIG. The tide may turn, but this ship's not sinking anytime soon.\n\n\\-\n\n**Disclaimer:** None of this information is financial advice because I eat crans.\n\n\\-\n\n**Positions:**\n\n10x $RIG Jun \\`24 $6C\n\n10x $RIG Jan \\`25 $10C\n\n\\-\n\n**Targets:**\n\nTarget over the next four years is $57.58. Current price is $5.14, so in my view that's a 10 bagger if you're patient.\n\nTarget over the next 3 months is $8.69.\n\nTo be safer, you can wait for the chart to break structure at around $5.41 before taking a bullish position.\n\n\\-\n\nInvest at your own discretion.",

    "title": "The case to move on from NVDA and AMD (long term)",
    "selftext": "There are times when I read about GPU makers here and I'm wondering if any of you have ever tried renting GPU by the hour or week or month for AI purposes in the past 2 years? If so have you ever calculated how much you're being charged per FLOP or in general the direction of the price of raw compute? As AI becomes mainstream and inference demand grows, what do you think happens to the basic laws of supply and demand?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI was in the data center business (aka HPC) until end of last year and I can tell you that pricing for Nvidia A100 rental had compressed by 70% over the last 2 years. The only reason you're seeing all these great GPU sales is because of 2 things: AI compute demand exploded, and greedy mofo distributors have been hording GPUs - yeah you heard me. I used to sell container loads of servers equipped with various GPUs like the A100, and then H100 purchased from the spot market (we do not have the volume to deal with Nvidia directly), and I've seen warehouses full of these GPUs sitting there waiting for the highest bidder. The only way Nvidia (or AMD for that matter) distributors get their discounts and priority is by placing huge orders. While you hear about big news of TSLA or AMZN buying a few billions worth of GPUs from NVDA, significant chunk of their GPU business is distributed by companies you've never heard of and made into complete systems via companies like SMCI. If you own the supply and you restrict the supply on the street, what will happen to the price on the street? There's a warehouse in Yokohama that I've been to that was floor to ceiling in tens of thousands of boxes of GPUs, waiting for the highest bidder.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSmuggling is also hugely profitable, not that my company ever did that, but we did have a ball selling overpriced A100s to Saudi Arabia before that was banned by the State Dept. However, the story goes that there's a vibrant and profitable smuggling business between Taiwan and China (where the most advanced GPUs are banned) via the Kinmen Islands which is only a few miles away from mainland China. Google Kinmen and you'll see there's been this brouhaha over 2 dead \"fishermen\" from the TWCG chasing and then hitting the \"fishing boat\" (that has FOUR huge outboard engines made for speed) and causing the boat to capsize and killing 2 of 4 \"fishermen\". Coincidence that none of the TWCG law enforcement personnel had their bodycams turned on, and rumor goes that TWCG is actually the biggest smuggler of them all. Why not? A few boxes here and there \"fall off the truck\" by TSM's loading dock and gets picked up by a non-descript van. Anyone ever looked at NVDA sales volume in Taiwan vs. its meager population? Yes they export a lot of that in the form of finished systems, but even the State Dept can't keep track of everything - there are plenty of ways to fudge the numbers, including TSM yield rates on \"defective\" GPUs.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhile TSLA, GOOG, MSFT, AMZN, META can all get their hands on the high end GPUs directly at great discounts, why do you think they also invest heavily in their own AI chip development using RISC-V or ARM? Why do you think companies like Tenstorrent has gotten so much press over the past 12 months around their open RISC-V ecosystem designed for general AI and compute?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAh but what do I know, I'm just a permabear regard (according to some) and I have no idea when this Jenga game will end. Enjoy the moonshot while it lasts, and congrats to all who profited hugely on NVDA, DELL, and SMCI the last few weeks. The party will end, I just don't know when but will keep my ears open when talking to my former colleagues knee deep in the HPC biz.",

    "title": "The Future of RDDT Stock",
    "selftext": "Hi everyone, I wanted to open up some discussion on RDDT stock. I think a lot of people are investing for the wrong reasons, have it wrong, or are misguided about the company. I do have stock in RDDT so please take what I say with a grain of salt, but I will try to be fair. Also, I am not saying that I am all knowing. If anything, I hope for some good discussion and to be proven wrong.\n\n\n1. Data Licensing\n\nFirst of all, I believe the average retail investor is blowing out of proportion the impact of Data Licensing for RDDT. It obviously is good to have and is an investment positive in and of itself, but people overstate the revenue impact. In terms of last quarter, data licensing revenue was about 7% of overall revenue. This is obviously not an insignificant number, but the advertising revenue grew 81% YoY compared to data licensing\u2019s 24% growth rate.\n\nThis means that data licensing is becoming an even smaller portion of revenue over time, even though it is increasing on a nominal basis. Another thing about data licensing revenue is that RDDT said they had already entered a lot of large value contracts, and that the following ones would be economically smaller but more numerous in terms of the amount of contracts. They have a contract renewal with GOOG which is obviously great, but it is unlikely going to be anything that dramatically moves the needle. A positive about Data Licensing though is that it is pretty much straight profitability. Also, even though it might not be too huge of a revenue impact, it shows that RDDT will be cemented in the future age of AI and LLMs since you need the authentic human interaction.\n\n\n2. Advertising\n\nThis is where I am extremely bullish on RDDT. The unique user base, the highly relevant content and discussion, the targeted ads, the fact that RDDT users are more likely to go on this platform for product choices and purchase recommendations all contribute into what could be a booming advertising platform. There are a few caveats and things to consider, however. I want to start off with what could be a negative.\n\nUser growth is slowing. RDDT no longer has the new IPO hype wave and wave of news flowing around it, which could have caused a lot more user attention and growth. Daily Active Users in the US fell this past quarter and they have historically had an issue of converting passive logged-out users to active and intent logged-in users. This is something to watch out for. RDDT in the last earnings call Q&A stated that there were some hiccups with organic traffic from Google Search, and user growth increased by the end of the quarter, but still watch out.\n\nThis post is actually getting long as hell, so I don\u2019t want to go on too much longer, but I\u2019ll finish off with where I\u2019m most excited. The opportunity to increase the average revenue per user is immense. New product and dynamic ads, optimizing ad inventory, new ad types, and more are coming. Look into ARPU measures and that\u2019s what you can be excited about for RDDT. You don\u2019t even need user growth for RDDT to be able to increase revenue by multiples (partially joking but it is crazy how much monetization potential there is.) Obviously they will never be Meta, but as the platform gains strength they have a lot to gain.\n\nI am happy to include more based on everybody\u2019s reception, but I hope these points can start off a discussion about the future of the stock.\n\n\n",

Future risks are potential for further adverse events related to ELEVIDYS, regulatory scrutiny, typical risks when dealing with biotech.\n\n[**TSM (Taiwan Semiconductor)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TSM&p=d)\\-Reported Q2 net profit of $13.52B, a 60.7% YoY increase, surpassing expectations.

And, according to the DOJ filings in the ongoing antitrust case,\u00a0**about 35 % of all Google search queries originate inside Chrome**, driving \u201cbillions in Search revenue.\u201d\n\nMeaning, three-quarters of every dollar Alphabet makes still flows through ads, most of which\u00a0*start in a browser tab.*\u00a0Every point of share that Chrome loses risks a direct dent in Alphabet\u2019s main cash engine.

Pension funds in turn will lessen in influx of capital, so they have less to invest. The circle gets worse and worse. \n\nI've heard many-a-person tell me: \"Remember the internet? Remember how many people said jobs would be lost because of that, and how they came back?\", but my biggest question is this: What will the job landscape look like around the world if AI is killing everything around it? \n\nDo we expect college-aged kids to go and work in the cornfields and do cleaning jobs because they can't find work after leaving college. More's the case, we're also going to see unpaid student debt rise beyond all measure....and the death of many-a-college.\n\nThe other side of it is that there will be a limit to how much can be cut, and unions stop AI killing every job in the world, leading to a more socialist world but one that sees more people employed. \n\nOr am I missing something?",

    "selftext": ">The artificial intelligence company has set many challenging goals. Autonomous vehicle software is now among them - but may pit the company against Tesla.\n\n>\n\n>Sam Altman has made many big claims about what OpenAI will be able to do, including spearheading ultra-expansive data centers and building artificial intelligence that can rival the abilities of Ph.D. holders.\n\n>But he also recently made a significant, yet largely overlooked, assertion. OpenAI is seeking to crack the code for advanced autonomous driving.\n\n>\u201cWe have some new technology that could just do self-driving for standard cars way better than any current approach has worked,\u201d Altman said last week on the \u201cUncapped With Jack Altman\u201d podcast, which his brother hosts. Altman added, \u201cIf our A.I. techniques can really go drive a car, that\u2019s pretty cool.\u201d\n\n>The technology is in its early stages - DealBook hears that it involves both OpenAI\u2019s Sora video software and its robotics team - but commercializing it is still a distant goal. An OpenAI spokesman declined to comment.\n\n>That could make Altman even more of a competitor to Elon Musk, who co-founded OpenAI but has since waged war on the company. (A short reminder: Musk has sued to try to stop OpenAI from revamping its corporate structure, and he\u2019s building a direct competitor, xAI, that\u2019s raising - and spending - billions of dollars.)\n\n>Autonomous vehicles are key to Musk\u2019s vision for Tesla, which he increasingly sees as the producer of huge fleets of fully self-driving cars. Tesla is focusing on A.I.-powered vision rather than on the array of sensors like lidar that Waymo, a Google spinoff, uses.\n\n>One big question mark for OpenAI: Where will its systems get their data? Tesla and Waymo have already amassed huge amounts of information and video through their years of driving on the roads.\n\n>That raises the question of whether OpenAI believes in a fundamentally different approach to self-driving tech, one that relies less on real-world data and more on advanced simulation, synthetic data or a breakthrough in \u201cgeneralizable\u201d A.I. Of note: The company recently collaborated with Applied Intuition, a start-up focused on putting A.I. in cars.\n\n>(OpenAI\u2019s venture arm also invested in Ghost Autonomy, a self-driving start-up, though the business folded last year.)\n\n>\u201cI think he really gets it,\u201d Altman said of President Trump\u2019s approach to A.I. (Altman has forged close ties to the president, including by donating to his inauguration fund and announcing the Stargate data center project at the White House.) \u201cI think he really understands the importance of leadership in this technology.\u201d\n\n>Altman was uncertain about whether the right A.I. regulations would come to pass: \u201cI have become a bit more, jaded isn\u2019t the right word, but it\u2019s something in that direction, about the ability of policymakers to grapple with the speed of technology.\u201d\n\n>Altman played down reports of tensions between OpenAI and Microsoft as they rework their relationship: \u201cDo you believe that, when you read those things?\u201d\n\nLink: [https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/25/business/dealbook/openai-autonomous-vehicles-musk-tesla.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/25/business/dealbook/openai-autonomous-vehicles-musk-tesla.html)",

    "selftext": "Everyone\u2019s watching the Musk vs. Trump drama like it\u2019s the main event, but markets should probably be paying more attention to what\u2019s actually in Trump\u2019s $3T \u201cbig beautiful bill\u201d  because it\u2019s very much alive and moving forward\n\nDespite Musk calling out GOP lawmakers, threatening primaries, and warning about the deficit (which, by the way, multiple analyses say will balloon by $2.4T+), the bill\u2019s still on track. Thune and Senate leadership basically shrugged him off. They\u2019re pushing this thing through  and fast\n\nHere\u2019s where it gets interesting from a market angle:\n\nThey're talking about cutting back the $40K SALT deduction to save money. But whatever they save might immediately get canceled out because there's also strong pressure to make temporary business tax breaks permanent  stuff like R&D deductions, bonus depreciation, and interest expensing\n\nThat\u2019s a huge deal if you're long big-cap tech, industrials, or healthcare. These tax breaks boost reported earnings pretty directly. If they go permanent, EPS estimates probably move higher without companies having to do anything operationally. Think MSFT, LMT, UNH  names like that\n\nBut here\u2019s the tradeoff: the bill\u2019s already inflationary. If they don\u2019t pay for it, bond yields are going to feel it. So while stocks might get an earnings tailwind, valuations could stay capped or even compress further if the 10Y starts creeping above 5% again\n\nAnd the AI provision buried in the bill? Wild. Originally it said states couldn\u2019t regulate AI for 10 years \u2014 a total federal preemption. Now they\u2019re walking that back to a softer \u201cyou lose broadband funding if you pass certain laws\u201d version. Doesn\u2019t matter much fiscally, but for megacaps like NVDA and GOOG, this is one less regulatory headache. The moat just got a little deeper\n\nOne curveball that could raise the cost: Section 899. It lets the president slap taxes on foreign countries seen as \"discriminatory.\" Some senators want to remove it, which could limit future revenue and geopolitical leverage. Not a today problem, but if you're watching defense and energy stocks tied to foreign trade, it matters\n\nAnd now there's infighting about Medicaid cuts. Josh Hawley\u2019s out here writing NYT op-eds saying this bill punishes working-class voters while handing corporate tax cuts. He\u2019s not totally wrong. If the GOP starts shifting back toward economic populism, how long do these business-friendly tax policies actually last?\n\nSo here\u2019s the real market question buried in all this: Are we about to get an earnings boost that the bond market completely wipes out?Because if you\u2019re buying the earnings upgrade but ignoring the debt story  you might be trading the right trend with the wrong multiple",

    "title": "$GOOG is successfully transitioning from a search company to an AI company",
    "selftext": "For years, we've known Google as the king of search. But if you think that's their only game, you're missing the massive shift that's happening right now. The idea that Google's money will soon come from a lot more than just search isn't some far-off prediction\u2014it's already happening.\n\nSure, search still pays the bills. But Google is aggressively building its future around some seriously impressive AI, and it's all starting to pay off. What really sets them apart, though, is their secret weapon: the power to weave their best AI, Gemini, directly into the Google search bar everyone already uses.\n\n# Google's \"Unfair\" Advantage: Upgrading Search for Billions\n\nThis is the kicker. No other AI company, not even OpenAI, has this kind of advantage. Google can take its powerful Gemini AI and plug it straight into its search engine. Imagine, instead of just typing keywords and getting a list of links, you have a conversation with a super-smart AI that gives you direct answers.\n\nGoogle can slowly shift billions of us from the classic search page to this new AI-powered experience. They don't have to find new users; they're already on Google's homepage. This means Google can test, learn, and improve its AI with more data than anyone else, creating a feedback loop that will be almost impossible for competitors to catch.\n\n# So, is Gemini Actually Better Than ChatGPT?\n\nThat's the big question. While people love to debate which AI is \"smarter,\" it's a bit more complicated. Both are incredibly good, but they have different strengths. The key for Google is that Gemini is getting really good at being accurate and not \"hallucinating\"\u2014which is the creepy AI habit of just making things up. You can't have an AI powering the world's search engine if it's spitting out fiction. So, Google's obsession with factual accuracy is exactly what's needed for the next generation of search.\n\n# It's Not Just Search, Though. Google's AI is Everywhere.\n\nGoogle's game plan is much bigger than just upgrading its main product. They're building entire businesses around AI:\n\n* **A Personal Expert for Your Documents (NotebookLM):** This might be one of the coolest, most useful AI tools out there. You feed NotebookLM your own documents\u2014reports, articles, class notes, whatever\u2014and it becomes an expert on *only that information*. It will summarize, answer questions, and even give you citations, all without pulling in random stuff from the internet. It\u2019s a game-changer for anyone who has to wade through a lot of text.\n* **Self-Driving Cars Are Here (Waymo):** While a lot of companies are still just talking about self-driving cars, Google's sister company Waymo is actually doing it. With millions of miles driven on real roads, their cars are already on the streets of several cities, operating as a ride-hailing service. They are, without a doubt, the leader in the self-driving race, which could be a monstrously huge business.\n* **The Powerhouse in the Background (Google Cloud):** All of this AI magic needs a ton of computing power, and that's where Google Cloud comes in. Its revenue is skyrocketing (up 28% in one recent quarter) because thousands of other companies are paying Google to use its powerful infrastructure to build their own AI tools. It's a classic \"selling shovels in a gold rush\" strategy, and it's working beautifully.\n\nThis kind of massive pivot isn't new, and the smartest companies have done it before. Look at Apple. It went from being a computer company on the ropes to the most powerful force in mobile by seeing that the future was in devices like the iPod and iPhone. Or consider Netflix. It started as a DVD-by-mail service and made the terrifying decision to blow up its own profitable business to lead the charge into streaming. They knew that if you don't disrupt yourself, someone else will. What Google is doing right now is playing from the same book. It's using its current strength to build what comes next, ensuring that as the world changes, it will be the one driving that change, not just reacting to it.",

This massive, outrageous, pork-filled Congressional spending bill is a disgusting abomination,\" he said.\n\n\"Shame on those\" who voted for it in the House, Musk added.\n\nBloomberg reported that Musk may also be driven by the fact that the\u00a0federal EV tax credit is being phased out by the bill, as he fought hard to keep it in place as a key driver for Tesla's business.\n\nMusk's barrage comes as the bill faces an uncertain future in the Senate, and a\u00a0Congressional Budget Office estimation\u00a0of its impact on the deficit adds fuel to Musk's line of argument.\n\nThe nonpartisan office projected the House-passed version of the bill would add $2.4 trillion to deficits over the next 10 years.\n\nThe formerly Musk-led DOGE itself has been criticized for not producing the budgetary cuts Musk touted it could find, and the cuts it has produced have been deeply unpopular.\n\nMusk's closeness to the Trump administration had been seen as a boon for Tesla, given its business with SpaceX and NASA and the regulatory levers the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration could pull in getting autonomous driving rules in place for Tesla's robotaxi testing.\n\nRead more:\u00a0How to avoid the sticker shock on Tesla car insurance\n\nBut demand weakness in the EU and recent protests at US Tesla showrooms have followed Musk's controversial foray into politics, causing\u00a0some Tesla owners to become alienated\u00a0by Musk, specifically by his right-leaning tendencies, DOGE, and outward support of President Trump.\n\nTesla's big robotaxi test is slated for June 12 in Austin.

Judge Mehta found the tech giant guilty of monopolizing the search engine market \u2014 specifically, the markets for \"general search\" and \"general search text\" ads, which are ones that appear at the top of the search results page,\u00a0Yahoo Finance\u2019s Alexis Keenan reported.\n\nLast Friday, Google and the Department of Justice wrapped up closing arguments in the remedies phase of the case. The Department of Justice\u00a0argued that Mehta should force Google to divest its web browser, Chrome, and share its search data with rivals as well as ban its exclusivity agreements that secure Google as the default search engine on mobile devices and browsers, Keenan and Yahoo Finance\u2019s Dan Howley reported.\n\nBarclays analyst Ross Sandler wrote in a Monday note that \u201cthe probability of a Chrome divestiture, while low, has increased in our view,\u201d following the closing arguments, adding that \u201cthe most likely candidates\u201d to buy Chrome would be \u201cwell funded AI companies like OpenAI, Anthropic or perhaps Perplexity.\u201d\n\nSandler said such an outcome would be \u201ca major blow\u201d to Google, given that Chrome has 4 billion users and represents 35% of Google\u2019s search revenue.\n\n\u201cThis would be a major development, a black swan event for GOOGL shares,\u201d he said. \u201cShares would obviously trade off significantly if this were to play out as no investors we speak to are thinking this remedy plays out.\u201d\n\nSandler said a Chrome divestiture would not only cause Alphabet stock to tumble as much as 25% but would also result in a potential 30% hit to Alphabet\u2019s earnings per share.\n\n\u201cThe reality is we don't know what the court is going to decide on remedies, we listened to the entire day of closing arguments and there were certainly times where we felt a lot worse than we did prior, and other times where we felt better (in terms of GOOGL stock price impact),\u201d Sandler said. He holds an Overweight rating on the stock.\n\nMehta is expected to decide on a remedy in the case \u2014 and the fate of Google\u2019s search empire \u2014 in August. Google said Saturday that\u00a0it will appeal the case.\n\nSeparately on Monday,\u00a0Alphabet said it agreed to spend $500 million to change its compliance structure in order to settle a case with shareholders\u00a0accusing the company of antitrust violations.\n\nAlphabet stock fell 1.5% on Monday, and shares are down 10.6% year to date.",

    "selftext": "I would love some feed back on the following strategy I plan to execute as a side project for myself. I have put together 30k for this. This is not my safe money or retirement money but it\u2019s also not Monopoly money. I am ok with high volatility as I execute this strategy. This is really to see if the strategy is good, understand the time commitment needed and also confirm to myself  that I can manage a good execution and not get impulsive. \n\nSuccess criteria: If done properly, I want to be able to convert this 30k to 50k over 3 years which is assuming a 20% YoY return. My current managed portfolio gets me 11-12% YoY last 7 years so if only I can get close to 20% it makes sense to me to use my own time to do it. I have a full time job so I expect to track the market news and stocks every other hour or so but not be constantly involved. \n\nThe distribution or strategy I have thought is:\n\n1. 40% (12k) in relatively stable stocks that I expect will beat the SPY so I am thinking Meta 5k Goog 5k Amazon 2k\n\n2. 30% (9k) relatively aggressive so I am thinking on two lines:\n\n2a: invest in stocks with associated risk but also good reward over 3 years like UNH, AMD, AVGO\n\n2b: invest in options of tickers with lesser risks but continued stable growth for aggressive return like BABA, WMT, TSMC\n\n3. 30% (9k) for buy the dip or DCA into above strategy. \n\nI would love your feedback on:\n\nA. Over strategy and percentage distribution. \n\nB. Tickers I have in mind vs others \n\nC. Anything I have missed in general. Is this sustainable along with a job and family. \n\nThanks again and appreciate your feedback. I expect to make these purchases over the next 2 weeks and do a few house cleaning things:\n\n1. Track overall and stock level daily move of anything more than 2% to make adjustment\n2. Monthly tracking of anything that moved 5% \n3. Follow broader markets news and adjust cash reserves accordingly. A little lower if outlook looks good and hold at 30% if it\u2019s same. Don\u2019t want to go more than 30% at any point. The idea is to play safe but not to play very very safe. \n4. Limit hopium and fomo, don\u2019t expect magic before or after buying. \n",

    "title": "Sum of the parts Valuation for Alphabet (GOOG/GOOGL)",
    "selftext": "We've all seen plenty of Google posts on Reddit, but most of the comments are a single line thesis about how they're super undervalued or how they're the next Kodak. \n\nI'm interested in your sum-of-the-parts valuation for each business segment. Let's see some details though, not just \"Waymo is really cool so it's worth a trillion dollars.\" Let's see your estimates for growth, your price to earnings/sales, your DCF's, etc... \n\nI'd love to see a few compelling arguments from the bull perspective and the bear perspective, show me what you think! \n\nEdit: I'll start with mine. \n\nSearch- Assuming search grows around 3-4% per year based on a combination of falling click-through rates and raising prices. I would assign around a 10x multiple for the earnings for the huge uncertainty on the horizon. Margins are incredible however, I would estimate around 40%, possibly higher. This would equate to about 80 billion in profit, so let's say search is worth around 800B.\n\nYouTube- TTM ad revenue around 36 billion, I'm hesitant to say this is high margin given the creator ad revenue split and the high hosting costs. However, with 125 million premium subscribers making them approximately 12-15 billion per year, let's just say the ads revenue sustains them at break even, and the subscription is pure profit. Assign a 30x earnings multiple (fair for the huge moat and pricing power), and you get somewhere near a 400B segment.\n\nCloud- The future crown jewel of Alphabet IMO, it's difficult to say what sort of margins they can achieve in the future, but AWS and Azure are IMMENSELY profitable. Let's assume 30% to be conservative? I also think GCP will average around 20% growth for quite a while, given their custom hardware and AI tools. I hate using price to sales, but I would happily pay 12x revenues for the multiple expanding moats, rapid growth, and enormous profitability. That puts cloud at around 540B. \n\nGoogle networks- shrinking business that's significantly less profitable than search, so we'll assume maybe 20% profit margin? I'd say 7x earnings for an estimated 6B per year business that is slowly shrinking equates to around 40B.\n\nOther -We'll just sum up every other operating segment into one giant ball here. You have Waymo, platforms/devices (already discussed youtube subscriptions), Google one subscriptions, and other somewhat un-monetized services like Gmail, maps, Gemini free versions, etc. It's extremely difficult to arrive at a conclusion with any precision here, so let's be conservative and say all of this is worth around 75B or so?\n\nBalance sheet and ventures- the balance sheet has ~300B in shareholder equity right now after zeroing out goodwill. Let's be ultra conservative and assume the total worth of their cash, equipment, buildings, land, fiber, satellites, data centers, etc. is around 100B net of liabilities. Ventures include partial ownership of SpaceX, Anthropic, stripe, and other very promising companies. Again, we'll err on the side of caution and say around 20B of value in their ventures portfolio? \n\nSo, in total, this gives me a current value of just under 2 trillion with what I think are very conservative estimates. I believe basically every segment could underwhelm, and you'd still end up with a respectable return in 10 years time. ",

    "title": "Why I am extremely bullish",
    "selftext": "I know this may contradict prevailing sentiment but I hope you can at least hear me out. I\u2019ve been buying the tariff dip on margin, with $1.4 million invested in blue chip stocks. I\u2019m up 46% in the past month. My largest buys have been in TSM, NVDA, ORCL, CAVA, AMZN, MSFT, META & SMH.\n\n1. Largest tax cut in history is coming. Republicans own the house and senate, and Trump is deadset on cutting taxes by $5 trillion. Obviously not good for the national debt but that will juice the economy big time. \n\n2. Midterms are coming in 2026, and Trump will not want to have a recession on his hands which would risk him loosing the house and senate. I am fully convinced he launched this tariff war so early on, so he could get it over with before midterms. Trump has pivoted extremely quickly on all reciprocal tariffs aside from china. And he is desperate to start negotiations with china. China and the U.S have both entered a de escalatatory tone, with both sides  making exemptions to tariffs, china expressing willingness to deal with fentanyl, and acknowledging the desire to negotiate- along side acknowledging that the U.S has reached out to them. They are BOTH eager to water down these tariffs and deep down, when both parties want the same thing (reduced tariffs) they will find a way to get it despite all the public bluster. Even if a deal could take months, they will likely have a pause either during or before negotiations. \n\n\n3. Rate cuts are coming later this year. It\u2019s likely there will be at least 2 rate cuts before year\u2019s end assuming tariff inflation does not cause extreme inflation. Rate cuts will boost the ability to borrow capital, increase liquidity and stimulating the economy. \n\n4. We are at the dawn of the largest productivity revolution in history. Everyone has seemed to forget about AI despite big tech earnings and guidance blowing it out of the park. MSFT, GOOG, and META are printing money, and AI is showing incredible returns in the semiconductor and data center space. We are still in the early stages of AI, the smarter it gets the more productivity will increase. \n\n5. The economy is currently strong. Jobs numbers in April (not a lagging indicator) were impressive. At the end of the day, so long as people are not losing their jobs the U.S consumer will stay resilient. Tariff effects could disrupt that if they stay in effect long term. However I think it\u2019s pretty obvious the worst of the tariffs are temporary. \n\n6. U.S exceptionalism is nowhere close to ending. We are miles ahead of every other economy in terms of innovation and technology. We lead in services, and nobody is boycotting GOOG, META, MSFT etc in a significant way. These innovative tech companies exist nowhere else in scale and success. Our consumer is 30% of the global economy and nowhere do they have such a wealthy large pool of consumers. We are still the world reserve currency with 59% of currency held abroad is dollars. And nobody, even Trump will let us lose that reserve currency status.",

I am targeting potentially good candidates for short-term trading; I have no opinion on them as investments. The potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting, everything else is secondary.\n\nWatching the typical market/volatility stocks in addition to the tariff play stocks.\n\nNews: [China says there are no trade negotiations with the US over Tariffs](https://apnews.com/article/china-us-tariff-negotiations-trump-481ff4402f5c34776ffcb8ced4c8ae42)\n\n[**F (Ford)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=F&p=d)**,** [**GM (General Motors)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=GM&p=d)**,** [**STLA (Stellantis)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=STLA&p=d)\\- President Trump announced the possibility of increasing the existing 25% tariff on cars imported from Canada, aiming to \"reduce reliance on foreign car imports and promote domestic auto manufacturing\". This news happened afterhours yesterday (which is why all the car companies had a weird spike at the close). This is a rehash of the 25% tariff on all imported cars which was announced ahead of 'Liberation Day', so I don't think this should ultimately shouldn't have a massive effect on these stocks unless there are additional tariffs. 25% tariffs on imports of automobiles/automobile parts have been known for a while, so at this point I'll wait to see how car companies react at the open. The highest risk at the moment are retaliatory tariffs from Canada.\n\n[**INDA (India ETF)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=INDA&p=d)\\- Pakistan has suspended all trade with India, closed its airspace to Indian airlines, and rejected India's claims regarding a Kashmir attack, escalating tensions between the two nations. The geopolitical tension between the two countries has been going on for close to 100 years, watching to see if there's more escalation between the two countries.\n\n[**AAL (American Airlines)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AAL&p=d)\\- American Airlines reported Q1 earnings with an EPS of -$0.59 vs. -$0.69 expected and revenue of $12.6B vs. $12.5B expected. The company withdrew its FY outlook and provided weak Q2 guidance based on current demand trends. Interested in $9 level. Overall bearish but no position. AAL has fallen close to 50% since February, so I'm mainly interested to see if there is any chance of economic turnaround. There are some knock-on effects from tariffs due to fuel costs/economic prosperity of travelers for discretionary spending. Risks are typically continued persistently weak demand and operational disruptions (further plane accidents).\n\n[**ZIM (ZIM Integrated Shipping Services)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=ZIM&p=d)**,** [**SBLK (Star Bulk Carriers)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SBLK&p=d)**,** [**MATX (Matson, Inc.)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=MATX&p=d)\\- Flexport (a supply chain logistics platform) reported a 60% decline in ocean freight bookings from China to the U.S. since new tariffs took effect, leading carriers to cancel a quarter of sailings and reroute capacity to other trade lanes. Overall more of a swing trade for the long term rather than a day trade, interested primarily in MATX. The shipping industry is experiencing significant disruptions due to trade policy changes; we'll likely see earnings affect a ton of these stocks and I'm interested if they give outlook during earnings.\n\n**Earnings:** [**GOOG**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=GOOG&p=d), [**TMUS**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TMUS&p=d), [**GILD**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=GILD&p=d)",

The more I think, the more the following scenario makes sense:\n\n* Google has unlimited access to YouTube, which gives them edge over others on training video related GenAI\n\n* YouTube has already a proven business model based on user created content with ads or subscription.\n\n* I can see that with GenAI tools from Google, it\u2019ll be possible for people to create \u201cprofessional\u201d content; short movies, series, animes. Some of them will be hits.\n\n* End game, YouTube will take a big portion from the movie/series market, both watching and also production.\n\n* At some point this might mean big studios and distribution channels (including Netflix) will loose some market to YouTube.\n\n* I expect this to become visible by the end of 2026: A couple of GenAI series, created by a very small team (say 5-10). No actors, just skilled labor.\n\n* I expect the quality and quantity to increase in the next 3-5 years\n\nBased on this outlook, I\u2019m just thinking to simply buy Google stock.

A sign of escalation and a warning, China is essentially responding in kind that it will give tariffs back (just like 2018). Reduced Chinese investment could result in less liquidity in the markets overall and larger volatility. If you want to see a reminder of how Chinese stocks performed when we got into a trade war, look at 2018-2019. We haven't a seen a meaningful move in these stocks yet, but if there are responses from China in kind to the tariff announcement today, things are going to get volatile,\n\n[**SPY (S&P 500 ETF)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SPY&p=d), [**QQQ (Invesco QQQ)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=QQQ&p=d), VXX, etc. - President Trump is set to unveil new tariffs today but is still finalizing details. Options include a tiered system (10%-20%) or a flat 20% global tariff. We're likely going to see a LOT of incremental headlines today on this until Trump speaks in the Rose Garden; I'll be watching what he says on the websites he posts on, and going for the speed trade on this. He is expected to talk at 4PM Eastern. Obviously, a lot of volatility and uncertainty due to no one knowing what exactly the tariff plans are going to be. The imposition of new tariffs could escalate trade tensions, leading to retaliatory measures from affected countries (which we don't know the extent of how many are affected) and impacting global economic growth.\n\n[**TSLA (Tesla)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TSLA&p=d)\\- Tesla reported preliminary March China deliveries of 78.8K vehicles vs 89.1K YoY. The company has delivered 336,681 cars in the first quarter, far fewer than the 390,000 expected. The decline in Tesla's China deliveries was a bit of a signal that the global sales would be bad, but frankly this wasn't as terrible as I expected. Currently short, will cover if we break $260 to the upside. Also interested in the $250 level. You guys know the risks by now (BYD and competitors, Musk, politics, etc).\n\n[**META**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=META&p=d), [**SNAP**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SNAP&p=d), [**GOOG**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=GOOG&p=d) \\- The April 5th deadline for TikTok to be sold off or face a ban is approaching, potentially leading to incremental headlines today in addition to tariff news. No real move in these stocks yet but I expect any news headline that is negative for TikTok to be great for the companies I'm watching (social media rivals). A ban on TikTok could alter the membership for the social media sites mentioned (they have to go somewhere). Since this is a weekend headline, I'm thinking of buying more GOOG- if TikTok DOES get banned, then these companies will likely gain. Otherwise, business continues as usual and they don't benefit. .",

    "selftext": "\nMajor indexes closed slightly higher Tuesday as the stock market continued its recovery from an extended selloff.\n\nThe S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite added 0.2% and 0.5%, respectively, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose fractionally. Stocks had kicked off the week with big gains following news that President Trump could scale back some of the tariffs that are due to be imposed next week on U.S. trading partners. With the recent gains, the Dow has inched back into positive territory for 2025, as stocks have rebounded from a month-long selloff spurred by concerns about the potential impact of tariffs and uncertainty about the outlook for the economy.\n\nInvestors brushed off consumer confidence data released this morning that came in weaker than expected, with the index hitting its lowest level in more than four years. Investors are closing watching all data points amid worries that tariffs could reignite inflation and cause economic growth to stall. The big economic report of the week comes Friday with the scheduled release of the Federal Reserve's preferred measure of inflation.\n\nThe yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which had fallen during the recent stock market rout amid the growing concerns about the economy, was at 4.32% in late trading, down from 4.33% at yesterday's close and from an earlier high Tuesday of 4.37%. The yield, which affects costs on all sorts of loans, notably mortgages, hit its highest level in more than a month this morning.\n\nMega-cap technology stocks, which helped lead Monday's rally, were mostly higher again today. Shares of Tesla (TSLA) rallied late in the day to finish 3.5% higher, gaining ground for the 5th consecutive session, despite news Tuesday that the EV maker's sales in Europe continued to slide. Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN) and Meta Platforms (META) each rose more than 1%, while Microsoft (MSFT) inched ahead. Chipmakers Nvidia (NVDA) and Broadcom (AVGO) closed slightly lower\n\n\n\nhttps://www.investopedia.com/dow-jones-today-03252025-11702763",

    "selftext": "Short sellers have been cleaning up to start 2025 amid a massive sell-off in some of the market's most popular names over the past two years.\n\nShort sellers have made a combined $15 billion betting against Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA) stock thus far this year, according to data from S3 Partners. Tesla shorts alone have raked in nearly $11 billion, while bets against Nvidia have brought in more than $4 billion.\n\nTesla's 40% year-to-date drop has led the declines of the so-called Magnificent Seven stocks. Investors have grown concerned about CEO Elon Musk's focus on government efficiency efforts and how his role with President Trump's administration could be a turnoff to the electric vehicle maker's customer base.\n\nBut it hasn't just been Tesla lagging. As an index, the Magnificent Seven \u2014 which also includes Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), and Meta (META) \u2014 is underperforming the S&P 500 this quarter by the most since 2022.\n\nShort sellers have profited off of all of the names in the cohort this year. They've brought in nearly $5 billion betting against Apple stock, which is down nearly 14% in 2025.\n\nThe crash in the most popular trade of the past two years comes as investors have been re-rating their growth expectations. Fears of slowing economic growth and the impact of Trump's tariff policies have weighed on markets. Meanwhile, Big Tech has faced growing investor criticism about its ballooning AI spend and whether or not it will eventually boost future profits as much as Wall Street hopes. The year also included a massive drawdown in some large tech names, including Nvidia, following the release of a cheaper AI model from Chinese company DeepSeek.\n\nNow, with most of the names sitting around 20% off their recent 52-week highs, the looming question for markets is whether or not investor appetite for the stocks that led the market higher for the past two years will return.\n\n\"Maybe these tech stocks got ahead of their skis a little bit,\" BMO Capital Markets chief investment strategist Brian Belski told Yahoo Finance last week. \"But at the end of the day, these are monster companies that define the growth trajectory for the United States stock market.

We saw INTC make a decent bounce in the overnight yesterday on that news, but it looks like we're giving back most of those gains. This move comes as Intel faces significant losses in its manufacturing division, the CHIPS Act is targeted by Trump, so frankly a very good positive catalyst but I don't expect much to come of this.

The company's stock has experienced a nearly 50% decline from recent highs within the past month. I thought this was interesting yesterday near the open so I bought some stock, overall still holding but interested to see where it goes after the open. Also worth noting, Reddit's plans to monetize its subscriber base are expected to boost revenue (I see them competing with Patreon/Substack/Onlyfans). This is overall a pretty positive catalyst, not much risk to it beyond additional negative news coming in for the broader tech sector.\n\n[**NVDA (Nvidia)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&p=d) **/** [**GOOG (Alphabet)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=GOOG&p=d)\n\nGoogle has unveiled Gemma 3, a new AI model designed for developers to create applications capable of running efficiently on various devices, including those powered by Nvidia GPUs. I'm also long NVDA a little more- GOOG hasn't pulled back as much as I expected compared to NVDA, but this is pointedly good news. We're also seeing a minor market bounce but whether that can hold is up in the air. Going to sell out if we break new lows in the market. Another model in the arms race that can be run on a SINGLE device is massive news, especially considering the model's competitiveness with Deepseek R1. This is overall positive news but there's always the chance that Deepseek releases an even better model in the future even though the $13M training costs have been debunked. \n\n**Sidenote:** Initiated a small short position in VXX after it broke above 60 (as mentioned yesterday); however, the primary focus remains on RDDT today.\n\n**Earnings:** [**ADBE**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=ADBE&p=d), [**PATH**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=PATH&p=d), [**S**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=S&p=d) ",

    "title": "Trump's DOJ wants a Google breakup but is willing to leave AI alone",
    "selftext": "President Trump and his predecessor, Joe Biden, now largely agree on a major point that has the potential to reshape the tech world: Google should be broken up.\n\nBut there is an important difference that emerged in a filing last Friday: Trump\u2019s Justice Department wants to let Google (GOOG, GOOGL) keep its investments in artificial intelligence. It notably has a stake in OpenAI rival Anthropic worth billions.\n\nBacking off the Biden administration's request to force Google to sell off its AI bets was \"significant\" and \"very justified,\" said Mark McCareins, a business law professor at Northwestern University\u2019s Kellogg School of Management.\n\nIt \"may be an indication that the government worries about deterring AI advances in the global race with China,\" added David Olson, associate law professor at Boston College Law School.\n\nThe stock of Google's parent, Alphabet, dropped more than 4% Monday as other tech stocks also sold off on macroeconomic concerns.\n\nThe final decision on what happens to Google's $2 trillion empire in court will be in the hands of federal judge Amit Mehta, who ruled last August that Google illegally monopolized online markets for \"general search\" and \"general search text.\u201d\n\nNo matter what Mehta decides, Google is expected to appeal, and the DOJ can too. Hearings to decide on remedies in this case are slated for April and May.\n\nFinal remedy recommendations from the government and Google were due to the judge Friday, giving a Trump-led DOJ one last chance to alter the prior Biden-era suggestion to the judge that Google be broken up with the forced sale of Google\u2019s Chrome browser or contingent sale of its Android operating system.\n\nIt didn\u2019t do so, despite being lobbied by the company to reconsider the Chrome proposal on national security concerns.\n\n\"Google must divest the Chrome browser \u2014 an important search access point,\" the DOJ stated in its final proposal on Friday.\n\nIt argued that under a different owner, new rivals would have an \u201copportunity to operate a significant gateway to search the internet, free of Google\u2019s monopoly control.\u201d\n\nThey also retained part of a request to leave the door open to a possible divestiture of Google's Android operating system.\n\nBut prosecutors did drop the Biden DOJ's push for Google to sell off its AI bets, instead suggesting a setup where federal authorities could keep tabs on proposed AI investments that could threaten search competition.\n\nAnthropic has argued to the judge that forcing Google to relinquish its stake would tilt the AI playing field in favor of OpenAI and its backer, Microsoft (MSFT).\n\n\u201cPlaintiffs no longer seek the mandatory divestiture of Google\u2019s AI investments,\u201d the DOJ said Friday in its revised proposal.\n\nDerek Mountford, a shareholder in Gunster's business litigation practice group who specializes in antitrust litigation, said while the Trump administration's AI rollback is a concession, it comes with a hook.\n\n\"They're asking for some reporting requirements to be attached to it,\" he said.\n\n\"I think one of the [antitrust] themes you might see in a second Trump administration is even if they're walking back some of the proposed sanctions, there's still that element of control and monitoring and enforcement that's going on in the background.\"\n\nThe tension for the Trump administration, Chamber of Progress CEO Adam Kovacevich told Yahoo Finance last week, is that it is engaged in an existential fight with China for the future of AI and Google can still be an important weapon for the US.\n\n\"What are we going to do, hobble one of our main US runners in that race by breaking up that company?\u201d asked Kovacevich, who previously led Google's US policy strategy and external affairs team.\n\n\"It seems ill-timed to do that.\"\n\nThe DOJ did stick with another expected remedy proposal that strikes at a major contention in the case.\n\nIt asked the judge to block Google from contracts that secure its search engine as the default across dozens of internet-connected devices, such as mobile phones made by Apple (AAPL), Samsung, and others, and browsers, including Apple\u2019s Safari and Mozilla\u2019s Firefox.\n\nThat is not good news for Apple, jeopardizing a major revenue stream. In 2021, Google paid $26 billion for default search placements, and the lion's share of that went to Apple.\n\nBernstein analysts have estimated Apple\u2019s revenue from Google Search defaults is somewhere between $18 billion and $20 billion per year.\n\nGoogle countered the DOJ\u2019s request on Friday by asking that it still be free to enter into contracts to make Google search a default \u2014 so long as it does not condition search licensing based on device manufacturers also agreeing to distribute, preload, place, display, use, or license its AI Gemini Assistant Application.\n\nMcCareins, the law professor at Kellogg, said the DOJ has little to lose at this stage by holding on to Chrome divestment as a negotiating chip, given that both the underlying case and the judge's decision on remedies are subject to appeal.\n\n\"Just from a bargaining negotiating position, at this stage of the proceedings, I am not shocked or stunned that the new sheriffs in town have continued to argue for divestiture of Chrome,\" McCareins said.\n\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/trumps-doj-wants-a-google-breakup-but-is-willing-to-leave-ai-alone-080016759.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAACYwia9l044SxGCK_mri0gx-4TVLrnZzE1cLyqspOVq-n2zGEeY521rJZBcbAtAtZpG9pjQwjgHdoWCYutDGYaydayerBR3eZ7CxOK4KvoFb-5qR8PHIRJROnWQ40ALMQ9_HnlhH1NvgeQDycPTYmotjrq1CJK9_Z0lsxa8n3nyq",

Revenue of $7.66 billion vs. $7.5 billion expected. Ultimately said that data center segment revw will be down in Q1, but had clear positive outlook in 2025 and expected double digit revenue growth. This was what caused the stock to fall despite the initial spike.\n\n**Technicals:** Watching $100 level, but doesn't seem to be an irrational move in my opinion. Note that we've moved from $150 to $107 in the past 3 months.\n\n**Risks:** The vast majority of NVDA/AMD/every semiconductor's business's money comes from selling to businesses- individual consumers are a tiny slice of the pie despite gaming/client businesses growing, so I don't really pay attention to them (one exception is NVDA'S 50 series GPUs selling out within 5 minutes) . We also have threats from NVDA dominance, possible regulations from the US, etc, (Disclaimer: I generally don't invest in AMD)\n\n**Related Tickers:** NVDA, INTC, QCOM\n\n**Offhand Comments:** Overall doesn't seem to have affected NVDA or other semis much because what they cited was weakness that was exclusive to them and not the broader semis market.\n\n**Ticker:** [**GOOG (Alphabet Inc.)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=GOOG&p=d)\n\n**Catalyst:** GOOG/GOOGL reported fourth-quarter 2024 earnings with an EPS of $2.12 vs. $2.12 expected. Revenue of $96.5 billion vs. $96.67 billion expected. Cited FAR more spending in CapEx and a miss in cloud revenue (which signals that other competitors have taken their market share)\n\n**Catalyst/Sector Context:** Market had a pretty negative reaction to the news that they'd be investing far more in capex and missed on cloud revenue (was roughly $9B vs $12B expected).\n\n**Risks:** Elevated capital spending may pressure Alphabet's margins if the capex spending doesn't result in increased revenue, especially amidst increasing competition in the AI and cloud markets. I don't really see the China investigation to affect their stock price much, Google Search and Youtube are blocked in China and I doubt that China is going to let Waymo operate in their cities rather than creating their own solution.\n\n**Related Tickers:** MSFT, META, MAG7\n\n**Ticker:** [**UPS (United Parcel Service)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=UPS&p=d)**,** [**FDX (FedEx Corporation)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=FDX&p=d)**,** [**PDD (Pinduoduo Inc.)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=PDD&p=d)\n\n**Catalyst:** The U.S. Postal Service has suspended accepting parcels from China and Hong Kong following new tariffs imposed by Trump, affecting logistics companies like UPS and FedEx.\n\n**Technicals:** I'm mainly interested in PDD because they own Temu, which focuses on shipping small/low-cost goods to the US and using the loophole for very low shipping costs.\n\n**Catalyst/Sector Context:** The recent suspension by USPS may lead to increased demand for private carriers like UPS and FedEx to handle parcels from China. There are a number of Chinese companies that focus on shipping low cost goods (like PDD).\n\n**Risks:** Heightened tariffs and trade barriers could disrupt supply chains, increase costs, and lead to potential overreliance on private carriers, which may face capacity constraints and regulatory scrutiny.\n\n**Related Tickers:** XPO\n\n**Ticker:** [**UBER (Uber Technologies)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=UBER&p=d)\n\n**Catalyst:** Uber reported fourth-quarter 2024 earnings with an EPS of $3.21 vs. $0.48 expected. Revenue of $12B vs. $11.8B expected. Cited that they plan to do buybacks of their own stock.\n\n**Technicals:** Watching $60 level, no bias.\n\n**Catalyst/Sector Context:** Despite Uber's strong quarterly performance, they cited a potential $1 billion impact from a strong U.S. dollar on future bookings which results in worse earnings overseas.\n\n**Risks:** Outside of self-driving cars (Uber partnered with Waymo to operate in Austin), currency fluctuations and international markets affect companies you wouldn't normally expect.

Management highlighted the power of AI and their sizable contracts, citing the nature of the AI war being winner-take-all.\n\n**Technicals:** PLTR absolutely exploded and hit $102 premarket, currently watching $100 level to see if we continue the move. Other than that unlikely to be trading this unless we have massive volume come in.\n\n**Catalyst/Sector Context:** The PLTR ER highlighted the growing demand for AI-driven solutions across government/commercial sectors. Company emphasized securing substantial contracts in the competitive AI landscape, important because they are more closely aligned with the current government.\n\n**Risks:** Obviously being more closely tied to the government means that it has more leeway to be more monopolistic/aggresive in their actions, Alex Karp and Peter Thiel are closely aligned with current government leaders.\n\n**Related Tickers:** MSFT, GOOGL, IBM, AMZN\n\n**Ticker:** [**NVDA (NVIDIA Corporation)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&p=d)\n\n**Catalyst:** Chinese AI company DeepSeek is reportedly preparing to switch to domestic GPUs to circumvent NVDA chip restrictions. DeepSeek has bypassed NVDA CUDA for certain operations, utilizing the PTX (Parallel Thread Execution) language instead. Additionally, on February 2nd, DeepSeek, in collaboration with SiliconFlow and Huawei Cloud, launched DeepSeek-R1/V3 inference services on Huawei's Ascend AI chips. Huawei is also promoting its new Ascend AI processors to Chinese groups considering \"inference\" as an option.\n\n**Technicals:** After the insane move we've seen from $150 to $118, I actually don't consider this to be earth shattering news- China has always been trying to develop their own semis and not using NVDA for training is what they were \"supposed\" to be doing due to the trade restrictions. I'm still long but selling calls against my position, recovery might be slow for NVDA. It's interesting that they are attempting to bypass CUDA, which is essentially the \"standard\" for ML/AI training nowadays on NVDA chips and developing their own.\n\n**Catalyst/Sector Context:** DeepSeek's move to adopt domestic GPUs and bypass CUDA indicates they're aiming for technological self-reliance amidst U.S. export restrictions, rather than trying to adopt more NVDA chips (which presumably isn't a viable long term strategy).\n\n**Risks:** Nvidia faces potential revenue loss if Chinese companies increasingly adopt domestic GPUs and alternative programming frameworks. The effectiveness of U.S. export controls may be undermined as Chinese firms develop workarounds.\n\n**Related Tickers:** AMD, INTC, QCOM, TSM\n\n**Ticker:** [**BABA**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=BABA&p=d)**/(oil stocks, car stocks, etc).**\n\n**Catalyst:** U.S. implemented a 10% tariff on all Chinese imports, aiming to address issues related to drug trafficking, particularly fentanyl. In response, China announced retaliatory tariffs effective February 10, including a 15% tariff on U.S. coal and liquefied natural gas, and a 10% tariff on crude oil, agricultural machinery, and large-engine vehicles.\n\n**Catalyst/Sector Context:** The imposition of these tariffs marks a significant escalation in U.S.-China trade tension and more volatility to come through Trump tweets- we might see a trade war again (sigh) like we did in 2019. Not 100% sure if agricultural machinery will affect stocks like DE but will look into it.\n\n**Related Tickers:** JD, BIDU, TCEHY, PDD\n\n**Offhand Comments:** There are going to be retaliation investigations against companies operating in America, INTC and GOOG have recently been announced as under investigation by China. But it's very important to remember which companies have a presence in China and which don't- for example, GOOG search hasn't worked in China since 2010 lol.\n\n**Ticker:** [**GRAB (Grab Holdings Limited)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=GRAB&p=d)\n\n**Catalyst:** Grab Holdings Ltd. is considering a takeover of its Indonesian rival, GoTo Group, at a valuation of approximately $7 billion.\n\n**Technicals:** Watching $5 level, no bias. I'm not 100% sure if there's an actual \"acquisition\" share price for GoTo but will keep eyes peeled for that acquisition premium.\n\n**Catalyst/Sector Context:** The potential merger represents a significant consolidation in SEA's ride-hailing and food delivery sectors. Mergers typically streamline operations and reduce competition, leading to improved profitability for the combined entity.\n\n**Risks:** The proposed merger may face regulatory hurdles, including antitrust concerns, which could delay or derail the deal.

    "selftext": "Many people consider TSLA to be overvalued based on fundamentals. Make no mistake - it absolutely is... based on fundamentals.\n\nThe value of TSLA, beyond the Twitter-political volatility, comes from its proven track record in achieving the impossible.\n\n**Breaking Into an Otherwise Unbreakable Car Market**\n\nHow many new Western car companies can you recall successfully breaking into the market in the last few decades?\n\nThe only real answer is TSLA.\n\nEverything else is bleeding money, a penny stock, or a YouTube car review channel side quest.\n\n**Popularizing an Otherwise Undesirable and Impossible Product**\n\nBefore the EV boom, any consideration of a successful EV business would be immediately countered with legitimate concerns.\n\nThe car community wouldn't be very excited without their loud 4L V8 engines.\n\nThe product would be impossible to make as the batteries would be expensive, heavy, unreliable, and yield a low driving range. If you did get an EV, you wouldn't be able to charge it since there were no charger networks.\n\nNot to mention the expected environmental returns from selling EVs, but generally disrupting the market and directing it towards sustainable energy cars. I love my fuel-hungry loud 6-cylinder German beast, but ICE engines in the mainstream have an expiration date and will eventually become a niche when the larger market transitions to EVs. TSLA takes the credit for this - singlehandedly. Everybody else follows.\n\n**Scaling Up: Actually Selling Cars**\n\nTesla is [still leading](https://www.automotivedive.com/news/electric-vehicle-sales-us-2024-increase-cox-automotive/737528/) EV sales, and is in the [top 10](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/01/06/top-10-best-selling-cars-in-the-us-in-2023.html) of all car sales. Meanwhile, VW is closing down their factories in Germany.\n\n**Advertisement by Word of Mouth**\n\nYou see Ford Focus 1.0 EcoBoost billboard ads everywhere in Europe, and RAM / JEEP / Chevy Silverado / F-150 / Hyundai / Kia ads everywhere in the US.\n\nTSLA built itself on word of mouth and a vision for the future, which is a testament to its value for customers.\n\n**Elon's Proven Track Record in Business**\n\n[Winning](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/16/science/spacex-moon-nasa.html) NASA award contracts in competition with Blue Origin and other space companies, [catching](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp66ye6ep63o) skyscraper sized objects landing, and a Roadster [roaming](https://www.astronomy.com/science/astronomers-just-deleted-an-asteroid-because-it-turned-out-to-be-elon-musks-tesla-roadster/) through space are just a few of the business and technological achievements of Elon Musk (not to mention the side quests). With someone so unreasonably effective at building things that work, investors project that TSLA is a safe and promising bet.\n\nHow many reusable rockets has anybody else caught landing recently?\n\n**Criticisms**\n\nNo product or company is without criticisms. From the bad build quality, to the still-unfulfilled FSD promises, to the lack of Cybertrucks in Europe, to the removal of the turn signal stalks; and most recently, the political criticisms.\n\n**Consequential Actions, Not Ideologies, Drive the World**\n\nThe bottom line for a business is creating products and services that people love, and there are *zero* indicators that TSLA, as a business, is going anywhere. It thrives *despite* all criticism (of which I do think most is reasonable) and lack of marketing, which is a testament to the value they provide.\n\n**Market Temper Tantrums Are a Feature, Not a Bug**\n\nLook beyond the ephemeral temper tantrum-driven volatility of the market.\n\nLast year, in March, GOOG dipped from 160 to 135 when Gemini generated some questionable images; today it's close to ATH at >200.\n\nLast year, in August, CRWD dipped from 380 to 220 when they pushed out a buggy update. (How dare they, a software company, pushing a buggy update?!) Today, it's trading close to ATH again.\n\nToday, the market finally noticed DeepSeek and is going through yet another mental breakdown.\n\nIt is like a palm tree: it will bend but it won't break.\n\nLearn to put your prejudices aside and buy companies that execute well - not companies with a nice little PR team that will sweet talk you.\n\n**But Is It Overpriced?**\n\nBy traditional fundamentals analysis - of course it is. But we've already established there's nothing traditional about TSLA as a company, so your little P/E ratio calculations won't work. They have failed consistently.\n\nLook at the execution of TSLA and compare it to its Western competitors - they aren't even in the same league.",

Well, not really, but a whole lot.\n\nNow, I'm struggling to interpret what this means for the stock of AI companies which invested heavily in these models. \n\nOn one hand, AI really works and is progressing rapidly. Suggesting there are further benefits to get from AI.\n\nOn the other hand. The intelligence commodity is really cheap now. The DeepSeek model's weights are free. And it cost only 10M to train. AI companies which invested Billions on their models, just got their models superseded by a model which is now free for everyone. This is bigger news than the meta llama models, because this model now was trained really cheaply and the license says you can do whatever you like with it. \n\nIf the cost of intelligence will be 0, will the AI companies like Goog and msft make money out of their investments?",

I'm 41 and only just started my Roth IRA.\n\nSo my thinking is for example is it better to buy 2 shares of stock A at $200 per share or 8 shares of stock B at $50 per share, or no difference? I'm smart financially but not the best at stocks and in my brain it seems like stocks inherently have a ceiling and so lower stock of a strong company is better than higher stock of also a strong company.\n\nTIA",

With that in mind, it is possible, the DoJ will go this way, this time.\n\n* Search is close to 50% revenue of Google \\[Q3 results\\]\n* Browsers market shares: Chrome 60%, Safari 18%, Edge 8% \\[Source can be contested, because it's larger devices stats only\\]\n* Android - 70% market share in handheld devices\n\nGOOG has to fight hard to ensure a high search traffic.

Also, when you look at browsers, excluding Edge and Firefox, Opera has a pretty substantial user base by comparison. They are also one of the only \"browser stocks\" that there are. At least the only one of any substance. \n\n\n\nOn the flip side, even if Google ISN'T forced to sell Chrome, then we should see the momentum continue for GOOG.\n\nI\u2019ve been a long term holder of OPRA for this very reason. They have a steady growing base of 350M users and are continuing to buy up smaller browser companies. I\u2019ve always looked at OPRA as a hedge against GOOG, at least as far as their browser is concerned. It also pays to hold because they have a great divided.\n\nI\u2019ve been a long term holder of GOOG too though.

I bought more shares this morning, and am reiterating a Buy.\n\nI believe analysts\u2019 consensus earnings could be a little conservative and Google should continue to beat estimates with better growth and operating margins.\n\nGoogle's earnings quality is better than several tech giants for the following reasons.\n\n* It has a near monopoly in Search\n* Market leadership in media with YouTube.\n* A strong first-mover advantage with Waymo.\n* A fast-growing Google Cloud business, third only to and catching up with Azure and AWS.\n\n**Its earnings and growth are sustainable, thus it deserves a better valuation and multiple.**\n\nLet's take a closer look at Q3 earnings.\n\nQ3 GAAP EPS came in at $2.12 per share, beating expectations of $1.85 per share $0.27, or 14% - **This was a substantial beat.**\n\nRevenue of $88.3Bn (+14.9% Y/Y) beat by $2.05B or 3%.\n\nConsolidated Alphabet revenues in Q3 2024 increased 15%, or 16% in constant currency, YoY to $88.3Bn reflecting strong momentum across the business.\n\nGoogle Services revenues increased 13% to $76.5 billion, led by strength across Google Search & other, Google subscriptions, platforms, and YouTube ads.\n\n**Total operating income increased 34% and operating margin percent jumped a huge 4.5% to 32%.**\n\nGoogle Cloud revenues grew a whopping 35% to $11.4Bn led by accelerated growth in Google Cloud Platform (GCP) across AI Infrastructure, Generative AI Solutions, and core GCP products, **with record operating margins of 17%** as the cost per AI query decreased by 90% over the past 18 months.\n\nCloud titans Amazon (AWS) and Microsoft (Azure) have commanded huge valuations for their cloud computing businesses; with Google Cloud growing at 35%, it should continue to narrow the gap over the next 5 years. Also importantly, AWS and Azure have operating margins over 30%, and should Google continue to scale and leverage their existing fixed costs, they can reach the same margins. I also believe as they get better at AI, they should be able to charge more.\n\nBased on consensus analysts\u2019 estimates Alphabet\u2019s EPS should grow to $11.60 in 2027 from $5.80 in 2023 - that\u2019s an annual growth rate of 18%. Comparatively, Apple\u2018s estimated EPS growth through FY2027 is slower at 14%, and it sports a P/E of 33 compared to Google\u2019s 22. Alphabet\u2019s P/E is closer to the S&P 500\u2019s P/E of 21!\n\nI believe this is too low, and there is a lot of potential for its stock to appreciate on the lower valuation.\n\nBesides the strong EPS, a lot of Google\u2019s expenses are noncash depreciation and amortization and their cash flow margins are strong. They generated operating cash of $31Bn on $88Bn last quarter, or a 35% cash flow margin.\n\nThe antitrust regulation will remain a possible negative on Alphabet, but the final decision is still years away as Alphabet vigorously appeals the decision.\n\n**I recommend Alphabet as a buy at $176**",

It went from 50,000 weekly rides to 100,000 just in the last six months.\n\nThe growth is compelling and the addressable market is massive\n\nCase in point: Uber does more than 200 million rides each week. Let\u2019s let that sink in. So if autonomous rides can capture even half that market, that would mean 100 million rides per week. That\u2019s about 1,000 times where Waymo is today. 200 million rides a week translates to about a billion a month and over 10 billion a year. At $30 per ride, we\u2019re talking revenues of close to $300 billion per year.\n\nBut wait\u2026 there is more to the growth story\n\nIf Waymo is already delivering over 100,000 driverless rides, how many more people might switch from driving their cars to being driven by autonomous vehicles? The shift could be massive. For each person hailing a cab, there are at least 10 others driving their own cars. Many of these drivers might reconsider once they see millions of people relaxing in the back seat, streaming Netflix, while they\u2019re stuck behind the wheel.\n\nIn fact, early data backs this up. According to Earnest Analytics, Waymo is already retaining riders at a higher rate compared to other ride-hailing services like Uber or Lyft. People enjoy the experience of autonomous vehicles. Safety could also be another attraction. Waymo published a report last year indicating that its autonomous vehicles achieved an 85% reduction in injury-causing crashes compared to national rates for human-operated cars.\n\nInvestors will soon recognize that the $300 billion revenue figure for the current ride-hailing market has substantial growth potential \u2013 it could easily expand by 2-3x. A $1 trillion market for autonomous rides isn\u2019t out of the question. This growth would also translate to significant revenue opportunities for automakers like Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), which are working on their driverless vehicle technologies.\n\nBut wait aren\u2019t so many automakers and tech players working on autonomous driving?\n\nYes, but not all of them are making the same progress. Waymo has a head start in the market. Its main competitor, General Motor\u2019s backed Cruise lost its driverless permits in California after a serious accident, making Waymo the only publicly available robotaxi service in San Francisco. Uber exited its self-driving taxi program about six years ago and has partnered with Waymo to bring its services to the Uber app in some cities. While electric vehicle behemoth Tesla is seen as a leader of sorts in the self-driving space, given its large base of vehicles, it is only slowly getting into the space after the unveiling of its Robotaxi vehicle earlier this month.\n\nWaymo has some advantages in terms of tech as well. It uses a fleet equipped with high-resolution cameras, LiDAR, and radar systems, creating a comprehensive view of its surroundings. And don\u2019t forget Google\u2019s got a secret weapon. It crowdsources annotated data such as CAPTCHA codes from its massive user base, using that to train its machine-learning models. That\u2019s a big advantage in terms of understanding complex driving environments.\n\nThe best part?\n\nThese are self-driving cars \u2013 no human drivers, no unions, no employee or contractor issues, and no human cost. While there will be other expenses, such as software development and battery costs, the absence of driver wages could lead to exceptionally high margins. Margins of 50% aren\u2019t unrealistic when you consider that driver earnings account for a substantial portion of gross fares in traditional ride-hailing models.\n\nIf Waymo can capture about one-third of the $1 trillion autonomous rides market, it could generate annual revenues of around $300 billion. With a 50% margin, that\u2019s a neat $150 billion in profits. What\u2019s that worth? At a 30x earnings multiple, that would imply an additional valuation of about $4.5 trillion for Alphabet. Considering that Alphabet is worth roughly $2 trillion presently, this could take the company\u2019s market cap to over $6.5 trillion, or over $500 per share.\n\nTo be sure, building this sort of scale can take a good deal of time \u2013 quite different from signing up for say a Google or Netflix account. However, investors will need to look well out into the future. Think 2030 (not 2025), maybe even more. The point is not to get stuck \u2013 if you\u2019re concerned, look even further out, say 2035! The bottom line: Alphabet is growing Waymo quickly, has the technology and competitive edge, and is addressing a potentially massive market, making this high valuation within reach.\n\nSource: Alphabet To $7 Trillion By 2025? https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2024/10/23/alphabet-to-7-trillion-by-2025/",

    "selftext": "* Tesla's FSD, which is now promoted as fully-supervised, is now the core technology behind the robotaxi service the company plans to launch.\n* Most analysts assign hefty value for the FSD technology alone.\n\n  \nWith just two weeks to go for Tesla, Inc.\u2019s TSLA Robotaxi unveil event, an analyst painted a bleak picture of the company\u2019s self-driving technology.\n\n\n\n**What Happened**: Tesla\u2019s FSD, which is now promoted as fully-supervised FSD, is a \u201csafety disaster\u201d and \u201cgalaxies away from being anywhere close to the competition,\u201d said GLJ Research\u2019s Gordon Johnson in a note. Tesla\u2019s competitors in this arena are Alphabet, Inc.\u2019s GOOGL GOOG Waymo and General Motors Corp.\u2019s GM Cruise.\n\n\n\nWith Tesla eyeing the rollout of its Fully Supervised FSD in China, the Elon Musk-led company would be up against domestic player Baidu, Inc.\u2019s BIDU Apollo Go.\n\n\n\nJohnson referenced reviews by two sources to make his case. Independent lab AMCI Testing, which tried the technology, said the overall performance of Tesla\u2019s camera-enabled autonomous-driving software is \u201csuspect.\u201d In a report released on Tuesday, the firm said its evaluation showed how often human intervention was required for safe operation. \u201cIn fact, our drivers had to intervene over 75 times during the evaluation; an average of once every 13 miles,\u201d it said.\n\n\n\nWhile the FSD 12.5.1 was impressive, it is incredibly dangerous for drivers operating with FSD to drive with their hands in their laps or away from the steering wheels, it said. \u201cThe most critical moments of FSD miscalculation are split-second events that even professional drivers, operating with a test mindset, must focus on catching,\u201d it added.\n\n\n\nJohnson also referred to data from [Teslafsdtracker.com](http://Teslafsdtracker.com), which aggregates TSLA FSD driving experiences/data, in real-time from users, which shows that the latest iteration of FSD has a **critical disengagement every 130 miles and every 72 miles when driven in a city.**\n\n  \nData reported by competitors to the California\u00a0Department of Motor Vehicles show that miles to disengagement data for various players are as follows:\n\n* Waymo: 17,311 miles\n* **Amazon, Inc.\u2019s** AMZN Zoox: 177,602 miles\n* [Pony.Ai](http://Pony.Ai) (startup): 17,077 miles\n* WeRide (startup): 21,191 miles\n\nThe **metric for Tesla is 13 miles**, based on AMCI\u2019s statistics, Johnson said, although Tesla doesn\u2019t yet report data to California DMV, given its FSD tech is **only Level 2.**  \n\n\n**Why It\u2019s Important:** Johnson noted that many sell-side analysts assign a valuation of $300 billion to $600 billion for Tesla\u2019s FSD technology. In real-time, the value is close to zero, he said, adding that it could be negative, given the \u201cliability of putting something this dangerous on roads.\u201d\n\n  \nAccording to Ark\u2019s valuation model, by 2029, robotaxis, which has FSD as its core technology, would account for 63% of Tesla\u2019s revenue and 86% of EBITDA.\n\nFuture Fund LLC Managing Partner Gary Black, a Tesla bull, said in a recent post on X that Tesla's FSD is not yet close to the 99.99% efficacy needed for unsupervised autonomy.\n\n\n\nIn premarket trading on Thursday, Tesla rose 2.05% to $262.30\n\n  \nSource: [benzinga.com](https://www.benzinga.com/news/24/09/41047267/safety-disaster-tesla-fsd-galaxies-away-from-being-anywhere-close-to-competition-says-bearish-analys)",

There are countless economy studies about it and how it is actually better for all economic actors to not have monopolies, duopolies etc.  \n\nNow reading comments on this sub, it seems like people are experts in this difficult domain of antitrust law and almost always side with the companies that potentially break the law. \n\nWhy is that?

I.e. we are all nvidia shareholders if you bought S&P, but it would be better for other companies (and long-term for S&P) to fight a monopoly if there is one and ensure that the rules are respected and nobody abuses a monopoly. \n\nTo me this anti FTC, anti DOJ reaction is short sighted and hurts the long term interests of all shareholders, no matter what shares you bought.\n\n30% of my portfolio is GOOG stock and I believe the DoJ case is the best thing that happens to them. A monopolist is lazy, ineficient, not innovating enough because they have their revenue secured. No matter the DoJ decision, it will be breaking the status quo and push GOOG to innovate and create more value for shareholders. The same thing for NVDA. Long term, the worst for them is to be a monopolist and maintain the status quo. Until they become Boeing.\n\nTLDR: No matter what stock you bought, if you are in for the long term, it is in your interest for all the companies to play by the rules and have a competitive, anti-monopolistic, market.",

    "selftext": "So over years, I've been gathering over 50 stocks. Of course, some have performed great, largely because my timing, mid-2022, was an excellent entry point. But of course, I can't help brag about my selection choice. For example, Qualcomm, AMD, JPM, MSFT, GOOG, Citi.\n\nI (think), I hit most of the semiconductor names, except NVDA. For some reason, it never felt like a good investment. I have my skepticism about LLMs and Gen-AI hype. Besides, generating cat pics or idle plays with Chat-GPT, I haven't\u00a0***yet***\u00a0seen a business effectively using Gen-AI as a compelling competitive edge. So, please educate me here as well. AMD is different because of data center servers product line - which is more solid story.\n\nBesides missing such obvious biggies, not all of what I touched has performed. I felt, European carmakers (BMW, VW, MBG) were deep value at PE 3-5 and 8-9% yields, but obviously I was wrong. They were cheap for a reason.\n\n**Main question**\u00a0- I was wondering if I can do a simulation of hypothetical scenario where I had simply invested in index, saving me enormous time in research. If so, please suggest tools/sites?\n\nNote that the amounts and time of entry/exit are not constant, so I can't use the simple lumpsum or periodic investing calculators that assume regular constant amounts and intervals.\n\nWith 50 stocks in my portfolio, I wonder if it is just mirroring the index, or generating any real alpha. Obviously, when I buy something, I am highly convinced of my reasonings. So, it's hard to part with what I feel are \"my gems\". How do you cope with these emotional aspects of investing?",

    "selftext": "I've been experimenting text based GPT from OpenAI's ChatGPT to Google Bard to now Gemini AI.\n\nSince late '22 when the world was caught in attention on the magic of ChatGPT, people have been flocking to buy the next best accelerator cards (Nvidia), hoping they can be the next one to come out with the killer app - that ambitious goal to reach AGI first.\n\nIt's only up until very recently that I was made known that Gemini AI is entirely trained on Google custom TPU. I read a little about it (I found that TPU discussion is very little over here) and found that in the earlier days since Alexnet deep learning approach back to 2012.\n\nPrevious generalized computing (thank you Intel Xeon) tries to cope with big data workload. Accelerators were found to be particularly efficient in those machine learning workload. Early exploration by Google on designing custom TPU for themselves so they can have more flexibility catering to specific workloads. This decision alone turns out to be very valuable in today's Gen AI era.\n\nWith recent news from Apple that they have been training their AI models with Google's TPU, also the performance of Gemini AI to be on par with industry leading ChatGPT (heard that Antropic's Sonnet is even better - but Gemini is really good enough for my daily use).\n\nThese observations make strong statements to the Gen AI community, i.e.,  you can bypass Nvidia and still perform adequately well (even supercede for some reports) in your AI product offering.\n\nThe fact that Google does not hoard all its computing power to its own Gemini training, and the ability to extend its compute to customers like AAPL speak volume on the native TPU effectiveness.\n\nCost and time wise, Google is the prime candidate in AI era as TPU helps smoothen out the training cost. With ads revenue fueling the AI training (heard that OpenAI now needs more money), and superior TPU working natively, I'm of the opinion that Google will create a lot of value many years from now.",

    "title": "Bloomberg: US Considers a Rare Antitrust Move: Breaking Up Google",
    "selftext": "A rare bid to break up Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google is one of the options being considered by the Justice Department after a landmark court ruling found that the company monopolized the online search market, according to people with knowledge of the deliberations.\n\nThe move would be Washington\u2019s first push to dismantle a company for illegal monopolization since unsuccessful efforts to break up Microsoft Corp. two decades ago. Less severe options include forcing Google to share more data with competitors and measures to prevent it from gaining an unfair advantage in AI products, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing private conversations.\n\nRegardless, the government will likely seek a ban on the type of exclusive contracts that were at the center of its case against Google. If the Justice Department pushes ahead with a breakup plan, the most likely units for divestment are the Android operating system and Google\u2019s web browser Chrome, said the people. Officials are also looking at trying to force a possible sale of AdWords, the platform the company uses to sell text advertising, one of the people said.\n\nThe Justice Department discussions have intensified in the wake of Judge Amit Mehta\u2019s Aug. 5 ruling that Google illegally monopolized the markets of online search and search text ads. Google has said it will appeal that decision, but Mehta has ordered both sides to begin plans for the second phase of the case, which will involve the government\u2019s proposals for restoring competition, including a possible breakup request.\n\nAlphabet shares fell as much as 2.5% to $160.11 in after-hours trading before erasing some losses.\n\nA Google spokesman declined to comment on the possible remedy. A Justice Department spokeswoman also declined to comment.\n\nThe US plan will need to be accepted by Mehta, who would direct the company to comply. A forced breakup of Google would be the biggest of a US company since AT&T was dismantled in the 1980s.\n\nJustice Department attorneys, who have been consulting with companies affected by Google\u2019s practices, have raised concerns in their discussions that the company\u2019s search dominance gives it advantages in developing artificial intelligence technology, the people said. As part of a remedy, the government might seek to stop the company from forcing websites to allow their content to be used for some of Google\u2019s AI products in order to appear in search results.\n\n**Breakup**\n\nDivesting the Android operating system, used on about 2.5 billion devices worldwide, is one of the remedies that\u2019s been most frequently discussed by Justice Department attorneys, according to the people. In his decision, Mehta found that Google requires device makers to sign agreements to gain access to its apps like Gmail and the Google Play Store.\n\nThose agreements also require that Google\u2019s search widget and Chrome browser be installed on devices in such a way they can\u2019t be deleted, effectively preventing other search engines from competing, he found.\n\nMehta\u2019s decision follows a verdict by a California jury in December that found the company monopolized Android app distribution. A judge in that case hasn\u2019t yet decided on relief. The Federal Trade Commission, which also enforces antitrust laws, filed a brief in that case this week and said in a statement that Google shouldn\u2019t be allowed \u201cto reap the rewards of illegal monopolization.\u201d\n\nGoogle paid as much as $26 billion to companies to make its search engine the default on devices and in web browsers, with $20 billion of that going to Apple Inc.\n\nMehta\u2019s ruling also found Google monopolized the advertisements that appear at the top of a search results page to draw users to websites, known as search text ads. Those are sold via Google Ads, which was rebranded from AdWords in 2018 and offers marketers a way to run ads against certain search keywords related to their business. About two-thirds of Google\u2019s total revenue comes from search ads, amounting to more than $100 billion in 2020, according to testimony from last year\u2019s trial.\n\nIf the Justice Department doesn\u2019t call for Google to sell off AdWords, it could ask for interoperability requirements that would make it work seamlessly on other search engines, the people said.\n\n**Data Access**\n\nAnother option would require Google to divest or license its data to rivals, such as Microsoft\u2019s Bing or DuckDuckGo. Mehta\u2019s ruling found that Google\u2019s contracts ensure not only that its search engine gets the most user data \u2013 16 times as much as its next closest competitor \u2014 but that data stream also keeps its rivals from improving their search results and competing effectively.\n\nEurope\u2019s recently enacted digital gatekeeper rules imposed a similar requirement that Google make available some of its data to third-party search engines. The company has said publicly that sharing data can pose user privacy concerns, so it only makes available information on searches that meet certain thresholds.\n\nRequiring monopolists to allow rivals to have some access to technology has been a remedy in previous cases. In the Justice Department\u2019s first case against AT&T in 1956, the company was required to provide royalty-free licenses to its patents.\n\nIn the antitrust case against Microsoft, the settlement required the Redmond, Washington, tech giant to make some of its so-called application programming interfaces, or APIs, available to third-parties for free. APIs are used to ensure that software programs can effectively communicate and exchange data with each other.\n\n**AI Products**\n\nFor years, websites have allowed Google\u2019s web crawler access to ensure they appear in the company\u2019s search results. But more recently some of that data has been used to help Google develop its AI.\n\nLast fall, Google created a tool to allow websites to block scraping for AI, after companies complained. But that opt-out doesn\u2019t apply to everything. In May, Google announced that some searches will now come with \u201cAI Overviews,\u201d narrative responses that spare people the task of clicking through various links. The AI-powered panel appears underneath queries, presenting summarized information drawn from Google search results from across the web.\n\nGoogle doesn\u2019t allow website publishers to opt-out of appearing in AI Overviews, since those are a \u201cfeature\u201d of search, not a separate product. Websites can block Google from using snippets, but that applies to both search and the AI Overviews.\n\nWhile AI Overviews only appear on a fraction of searches, the feature\u2019s roll-out has been rocky after some excerpts offered embarrassing suggestions, like advising people to eat rocks or to put glue on pizza.\n\nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-08-13/doj-considers-seeking-google-goog-breakup-after-major-antitrust-win",

    "title": "Analyzing the Analysts: Using average analyst price target to identify buying opportunities amongst the top 100 companies in the S&P",
    "selftext": "Hello everyone,\n\nI'm a lazy investor and don't like to do much due diligence, but I do like to make money. Unfortunately these two things about me are often at odds as I've lost money in the past for not doing my DD. As such, I continue to be lazy but I try and find ways to work around doing due diligence and hopefully finding loop holes.\n\nOne such way that I have been thinking about recently is using analyst ratings, reviews and price targets as a surrogate for due diligence. In essence, I try to just have these analysts do the work for me. The idea is that much in the same way that with those who believe in technical analysis hold that everything you need to know about a stock is baked into it's price action, and so when something good happens the stock price goes up and when something bad happens the stock price goes down, thus all you need is to analyze trends in stock price and you'll be analyzing everything about the stock by proxy, I have a thesis (or theory) that perhaps you can do the same or something similar with analyst price targets of companies.\n\nNow I know that anyone who has read this far already thinks I'm an idiot. Many experienced individual investors probably find market analysts to be stupid and therefore I'm stupid for following their lead, but I would argue to the contrary for a few reasons. As much as I have put in a lot of effort to learn about how the market operates (been investing for the last 6 years, started learning actively about it as much as I could a couple years prior to that), there is still much I don't know as I don't have a finance or economics degree. Moreover, as bad as you may think an analyst is, they are at least competent enough to keep their job as an analyst at the investment firm that allows them to make stock price target selections. Lastly, and most importantly, what I am about to discuss below uses the aggregate of numerous analyst price targets so I'm not relying on a single analyst, but several (probably between 10 and 40 per company). I think if two-dozen analysts are strongly in favor of a company, it is unlikely that my novice investor wisdom would have researched the company and found a flaw that they all missed.\n\nSo what I did yesterday evening was go through the top 100 S&P 500 companies by market cap and find the current average price target for them on Yahoo Finance. I then divided the current stock price (at the close on 7/31) by that price target and expressed it as a percentage to see how far off the company was from the average price target analysts were aiming for. Then I also listed how many total ratings each company had, and how many of them were 'Strong Buys' and 'Buys'.\n\nThis yielded the following table:\n\n|+|A|B|C|D|E|F|G|H|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|1|Company|Current Price|Price Target|Percent to Target|Total Ratings|# Strong Buy Ratings|# Buy Ratings|% of Ratings that were Strong Buys|\n|2|AAPL|222.08|209.76|105.87%|38|11|21|28.95%|\n|3|MSFT|418.35|459.66|91.01%|34|14|13|41.18%|\n|4|NVDA|117.02|125.69|93.10%|38|14|15|36.84%|\n|5|AMZN|186.98|206.43|90.58%|47|15|28|31.91%|\n|6|META|474.83|490.04|96.90%|63|21|34|33.33%|\n|7|GOOG|173.15|185.45|93.37%|5|0|3|0.00%|\n|8|BRK.B|438.5|441.47|99.33%|6|1|3|16.67%|\n|9|LLY|804.27|817.03|98.44%|22|9|8|40.91%|\n|10|AVGO|160.68|180.62|88.96%|29|10|17|34.48%|\n|11|JPM|212.8|200.66|106.05%|28|9|13|32.14%|\n|12|TSLA|232.07|189.09|122.73%|23|0|0|0.00%|\n|13|UNH|576.16|569.6|101.15%|22|11|11|50.00%|\n|14|XOM|118.59|122.83|96.55%|25|5|11|20.00%|\n|15|V|265.67|282.26|94.12%|39|13|22|33.33%|\n|16|JNJ|157.85|158.53|99.57%|23|4|8|17.39%|\n|17|PG|160.76|161.5|99.54%|22|6|4|27.27%|\n|18|MA|463.71|474.87|97.65%|39|14|20|35.90%|\n|19|HD|368.16|355.97|103.42%|33|12|12|36.36%|\n|20|COST|822|886.84|92.69%|29|7|11|24.14%|\n|21|WMT|68.64|68.29|100.51%|32|8|7|25.00%|\n|22|MRK|113.13|132.14|85.61%|21|4|7|19.05%|\n|23|BAC|40.31|41.95|96.09%|30|6|16|20.00%|\n|24|CVX|160.47|167.84|95.61%|24|6|10|25.00%|\n|25|NFLX|628.35|640.43|98.11%|41|11|14|26.83%|\n|26|KO|66.74|64.8|102.99%|25|5|7|20.00%|\n|27|CRM|258.8|274.18|94.39%|45|16|25|35.56%|\n|28|ADBE|551.65|566.58|97.36%|31|11|14|35.48%|\n|29|PEP|172.67|168.65|102.38%|22|10|10|45.45%|\n|30|TMO|613.34|629.42|97.45%|15|8|6|53.33%|\n|31|AMD|144.48|175.48|82.33%|31| | |0.00%|\n|32|LIN|453.5|475.32|95.41%| | | |#DIV/0!|\n|33|ORCL|139.45|140.03|99.59%|36|10|16|27.78%|\n|34|WFC|59.34|59.8|99.23%|31|4|8|12.90%|\n|35|ACN|330.62|348.01|95.00%|29|7|9|24.14%|\n|36|CSCO|48.45|50.56|95.83%|27|8|11|29.63%|\n|37|MCD|265.4|276.47|96.00%|33|8|15|24.24%|\n|38|QCOM|180.95|191.24|94.62%|23|2|7|8.70%|\n|39|GE|170.2|171.93|98.99%|17|5| |29.41%|\n|40|ABT|105.94|124.37|85.18%|20|7|6|35.00%|\n|41|TXN|203.81|187.18|108.88%|32|6|8|18.75%|\n|42|DHR|277.08|284.09|97.53%|17|7|6|41.18%|\n|43|AMGN|332.47|320.24|103.82%|25|3|7|12.00%|\n|44|INTU|647.35|711.36|91.00%|22|6|3|27.27%|\n|45|PM|115.16|115.74|99.50%|18|2|7|11.11%|\n|46|PFE|30.54|29.38|103.95%|22|2|11|9.09%|\n|47|IBM|192.14|172.59|111.33%|25|4|4|16.00%|\n|48|DIS|93.69|123.11|76.10%|30|5|10|16.67%|\n|49|VZ|40.52|45.6|88.86%|32|2|6|6.25%|\n|50|CAT|346.2|337.62|102.54%|24|4|7|16.67%|\n|51|NOW|814.39|807.1|100.90%|34|13|17|38.24%|\n|52|AMAT|212.2|248.8|85.29%|21|4|15|19.05%|\n|53|GS|509.03|476.64|106.80%|27|4|7|14.81%|\n|54|CMCSA|41.27|46.36|89.02%|31|12|18|38.71%|\n|55|SPGI|484.73|521.39|92.97%|15|1|9|6.67%|\n|56|RTX|117.49|103.93|113.05%| | | |#DIV/0!|\n|57|ISRG|444.61|471.87|94.22%|17|6|5|35.29%|\n|58|NEE|76.39|80.23|95.21%|15|5|8|33.33%|\n|59|UNP|246.73|242.11|101.91%|29|5|7|17.24%|\n|60|AXP|253.04|253.26|99.91%|28|6|4|21.43%|\n|61|LOW|245.51|250.99|97.82%|32|8|10|25.00%|\n|62|T|19.25|19.3|99.74%|30|6|3|20.00%|\n|63|HON|204.75|226.96|90.21%|20|7|9|35.00%|\n|64|UBER|64.47|79.96|80.63%| | | |#DIV/0!|\n|65|VRTX|495.72|483.91|102.44%|27|10|12|37.04%|\n|66|MS|103.21|105.64|97.70%|27|3|14|11.11%|\n|67|TJX|113.02|107.04|105.59%|27|9|14|33.33%|\n|68|INTC|30.74|38.02|80.85%|41| |18|0.00%|\n|69|BKNG|3715.01|4192.39|88.61%| | | |#DIV/0!|\n|70|PGR|214.12|237.47|90.17%|19|5|4|26.32%|\n|71|C|64.88|71.01|91.37%|29|5|12|17.24%|\n|72|ELV|532.03|599.13|88.80%| | | |#DIV/0!|\n|73|BLK|876.5|936.85|93.56%|15|3|9|20.00%|\n|74|PLD|126.05|135.68|92.90%|18|4|8|22.22%|\n|75|LMT|541.92|535.31|101.23%|22|7| |31.82%|\n|76|ETN|304.79|345.86|88.13%|24|3|4|12.50%|\n|77|REGN|1079.19|1104.34|97.72%|26|7|6|26.92%|\n|78|MU|109.82|174.41|62.97%|31|8|20|25.81%|\n|79|CB|275.66|277.84|99.22%|19|5|11|26.32%|\n|80|SYK|327.45|378.81|86.44%|27|11|6|40.74%|\n|81|ADI|231.38|255.84|90.44%|26|6|10|23.08%|\n|82|LRCX|921.24|1041.75|88.43%|19|3|12|15.79%|\n|83|MMC|222.57|223.48|99.59%|19|4|7|21.05%|\n|84|BSX|73.88|87.57|84.37%|24|10|8|41.67%|\n|85|MDT|80.32|92.43|86.90%|23|4|7|17.39%|\n|86|BA|190.6|219.35|86.89%|25|7|7|28.00%|\n|87|ADP|262.62|264.65|99.23%|18|1|1|5.56%|\n|88|AMT|220.4|230.39|95.66%|22|7|14|31.82%|\n|89|PANW|324.73|343.43|94.55%|41|13|16|31.71%|\n|90|KLAC|823.07|868.07|94.82%|14|2|4|14.29%|\n|91|BX|142.15|135.47|104.93%|14|6|6|42.86%|\n|92|CI|348.67|393.25|88.66%|17|6|7|35.29%|\n|93|BMY|47.56|50.47|94.23%|22|5|4|22.73%|\n|94|GILD|76.06|81.02|93.88%|28|2|11|7.14%|\n|95|SCHW|65.19|73.89|88.23%|19|5|9|26.32%|\n|96|DE|371.98|422.99|87.94%|22|4|3|18.18%|\n|97|FI|163.57|177.14|92.34%|19|1|2|5.26%|\n|98|UPS|130.37|144.61|90.15%|26|3|2|11.54%|\n|99|SO|83.52|79.51|105.04%|17|1|4|5.88%|\n|100|TMUS|182.28|197.95|92.08%|30|7|16|23.33%|\n|101|COP|111.2|141.51|78.58%|21|6|9|28.57%|\n\n\nBased on this table above, I tried to identify some companies that met a few criteria. I wanted to identify companies that had at least 25% of their analyst ratings be 'Strong Buys', to have at least 20 analyst ratings available and for the current stock price to be at 90% or less of the average price target. This lead me to the following 11 companies:\n**Micron Technologies (MU), Boston Scientific (BSX), Abbot Laboratories (ABT), Merck Scientific (MRK), Stryker (SYK), The Cigna Group (CI), Broadcom (AVGO), Comcast (CMCSA), Honeywell International (HON), Analogue Devices (ADI), and Intuit Inc. (INTU)**\n\nI have about $5,000 I'd like to invest right now and I have half a mind to just put it equally weighted into these 11 companies and just watch it for the next year or two. I'll either do that or put it all in VOO, but I have a feeling that these 11 companies might beat the S&P 500 over the next 24 months.\n\nWhat do you guys think?",

I have my account set to automatically put $100/week into VTSAX (Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund). I\u2019m wondering if I can/should change my automatic investment at any point to a different stock. For example,  could or should I swap the same $100/wk to MSFT (instead of VTSAX) for say, 6 months? \n\nI know MSFT is reflected in VTSAX but only a tiny percent of it since VTSAX is the total stock market (not sure if it\u2019s US or Global now that I think about it). Should I stay the course with VTSAX or bounce around a bit to bolster my small holdings in MSFT, GOOG, etc? Thank you for your advice!",

I was trying to find something cheaper.\n\nI looked at Blackrock, and it seem to be doing fine. 6 bln income growing YoY, and 11bln in debt, which is ok. The company has a strong competitive position, over 11tn in assets under management, and an healthy PE of 20. I think that growth is likely to continue, (rising valuations, launch on new blackrock ETFs, service expansion) and their position is too dominant to be disrupted. I am not sure of their pricing power though, their ETFs clients are very sensitive, but at that scale they should fund a way to monetize (revenue is around 0.17% of their AUM). I don't see much risk, except for valuation, but I would like to hear different opinion and see if I am missing something.",

Since then, the stock is up 12.5% compared to 1.5% for the Nasdaq. \n\n\nWhat do you think about going long companies that have a dip in share price based on conservative backlash? Companies currently facing backlash for being too woke:\n\nNike $NKE for putting a purple St Georges Cross on their apparel\n\nTyson Foods $TSN for supposedly wanting to hire asylum seekers for their factories (although Tyson has denied this outright) \n\nStarbucks $SBUX for perceived hiring discrimination/DEI hiring policies.

    "title": "Tesla (TSLA) DCF Analysis",
    "selftext": "***NOTE: NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE***\n\n# Introduction:\n\nTSLA is the world's most renowned Electric Vehicle(EV) automaker, catalyzing the world's acceleration towards Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) Vehicles. TSLA has become the gold standard for what a high-quality EV stands for, all thanks in part to their founder's vision and belief in renewable energy especially during the tumultuous early years of TSLA. TSLA no longer just stands for EV but renewable energy, having branched out into Energy Storage, and Solar Panels.  TSLA hopes to create an ecosystem for renewable energy from charging to energy storage to the vehicle used, all this tied together by dedicated software created by TSLA at every point of contact in the ecosystem. This ecosystem business model has seen massive success as evident from businesses like GOOG, AAPL, and MSFT. I believe the next frontier of growth for TSLA comes from energy storage rather than automotive, however automotive will still account for the largest chunk of revenue for TSLA.\n\n# Market:\n\nTSLA's closest EV competitor is BYD. TSLA has won BYD on almost every front. A country where BYD has managed to wrest control from TSLA is Thailand. So I'll analyze this market specifically to rationalize why I believe this victory will be shortlived.\n\nIn Thailand, the top 3 most popular car models are BYD Atto 3, Netta V, and BYD Dolphin ([SOURCE](https://carnewschina.com/2024/01/09/byd-is-bestselling-ev-brand-in-thailand-in-2023-neta-is-runner-up/)).   \n\n|Model|Price|Range|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|BYD Atto 3|1.1M Baht|521 km/charge|\n|Neta V|0.55M Baht|380 km/charge|\n|BYD Dolphin|0.75M Baht|427 km/charge|\n|Tesla Model 3|1.59M Baht|513 km/charge|\n\nIn Thailand, 60.17% of the population owns a car ([SOURCE](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1027960/thailand-car-ownership-among-consumers/)) with the average car price being about 0.78M Baht. This means that a Tesla Model 3, TSLA's cheapest model is double the average price of a normal car in Thailand. \n\n[SOURCE](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1030220/thailand-average-monthly-income-per-household-by-region/)) which means that the Tesla Model 3 is a luxury good rather than an affordable commodity for the average household. The difference in price between BYD and Tesla is a full year's worth of income for the average household which leads the price-conscious consumers in Thailand to naturally gravitate towards BYD, hence the popularity of BYD over Tesla in Thailand. \r  \n\r  \nUltimately, I do believe that if TSLA continues competing on quality and finds ways to cut costs such as directly setting up factories in Thailand ([SOURCE](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/03/05/business/thailand-tesla-factory-talks-intl-hnk/index.html)), it will be able to close the price gap with BYD. As \"people are really stretching their wallets to be able to afford a Tesla. It\u2019s quite a difficult thing for them to do, and remarkable that it\u2019s the best-selling car in unit volume, despite being much more expensive than other high-volume cars.\u201d - 2023 Q4 Earnings Conference\r\n\n# Revenue:\n\nTSLA has 5 revenue channels, namely \u201cAutomotive Sales\u201d, \u201cServices and Others\u201d, \u201cAutomotive Lease\u201d, \u201cAutomotive Regulatory Credit\u201d and \u201cEnergy Generation and Storage sales\u201d. \n\n***Automotive Sales***\n\nAutomotive sales refers to the direct sale of TSLA\u2019s vehicles fully paid upfront.\n\nElon Musk believes that manufacturing capabilities will be the most important C.A. for TSLA. \u201cperhaps the most important competitive characteristic of Tesla in the future will be manufacturing technology\u201d -  2023 Q4 Earnings Conference. \r\n\nWhen forecasting the Number of Vehicles each Gigafactory can produce, I took into account that Elon Musk recently unveiled in the 2023 Q4 Earnings conference that there is a new revolutionary manufacturing technology that is expected to drastically improve production. He hopes to pilot test this technology at the Texas Gigafactory to produce their low-cost EV before proceeding to replicate the technology in every Gigafactory. \u201cthe sensible way to go about things is kind of figure out the core technology of the manufacturing line and then replicate it with improvements throughout the world.\u201d -  2023 Q4 Earnings Conference.\r So, in my first 3 years, I assume that the growth rate is below historical averages as TSLA tests out new technology in preparation for the launch of the low-cost EV. I assumed that TSLA\u2019s manufacturing technology was successful.\r  \n\r\r\r  \nWhen forecasting %Vehicles delivered, opting for less granularity I forecasted it as a % of historical averages\r  \n\r  \nWhen forecasting Avg Price/Vehicles Delivered, Elon Musk doesn\u2019t believe in price increases to increase the topline. As evident in 2021 and 2022 where Elon Musk only increased prices due to supply chain constraints before bringing prices back down in 2023. In China, Elon Musk ended up cutting prices due to being able to source significantly cheaper batteries there. I assumed that over time as TSLA enjoys sufficient economies of scale, they will only increase prices in line with perpetual inflation.\r  \n\n\n***Services and Others***\n\nTSLA provides a few services such as home servicing in certain regions or customers pay to access TSLA\u2019s network of SuperChargers.\r  \n\r  \nLifetime number of TSLA automobile (Ex roadster) delivered ([SOURCE](https://backlinko.com/tesla-stats))\n\nAssuming that TSLA is properly maintained they can last \\~20 years ([SOURCE](https://caredge.com/blog/how-long-tesla-batteries-last)). Opting for less granularity, in my forecast I assumed the total lifetime number of tesla cars remained constant without any churn.\r\n\nWhen forecasting Services and Others, Opting for less granularity I assumed that the servicing\u2019s pricing grew following the price of the vehicle in line with historic averages. \n\n\r  \n***Automotive Lease***\n\nTSLA has 2 types of lease, \u201cDirect Vehicle Operations Lease\u201d which leases out vehicles to customers for up to 48 months afterwards the vehicle is returned to TSLA. \u201cDirect Sales Lease\u201d either granting the customer title of the vehicle once full payment has been made or the customer has the option of refusing the vehicle.\r  \n\r  \nWhen forecasting Automotive leasing, as prices for TSLA fell in 2023, Automotive leasing as a percentage of Automotive Sales dropped as it is now cheaper for customers to purchase their tesla in 1 lump sum payment. I assumed that following this trend, as TSLA\u2019s affordability increases over time the %Automotive Sales decreases as well before remaining constant in perpetuity.\n\n\r  \n***Automotive Regulatory Credit***\n\nTSLA has excess carbon credit which it sells to competitors.\n\n\u201cIt will continue for some period of time, but eventually this stream of regulatory credits will reduce.\u201d ([SOURCE](https://www.businessinsider.com/tesla-9-billion-revenue-selling-regulatory-credits-to-other-carmakers-2024-2)).\r  \n\r\n\nWhen forecasting Automotive Regulatory Credit, given that TSLA does not intend to depend on these credits for revenue, I assume that as a %of Automotive sales, credit will contribute to a significantly lesser amount in perpetuity. This is further exacerbated by other automobile companies accelerating their push towards EVs as countries begin phasing out ICE vehicles. So, more companies begin having excess regulatory credits as well. Ultimately, I believe that leading up to 2030 the amount of revenue contributed by Regulatory credits decreases to a significant level. \n\n\r  \n***Energy Generation and Storage Sales***\n\nTSLA produces Energy Storage systems e.g. Megapack and Solar Energy related products e.g. Solar Panels which it directly sells to customers.\r  \n\r  \nFor energy storage more specifically megapacks, as the world phases out ICE vehicles and begins embracing renewable energy, it leads to a surge in demand for electricity. However, the issue with renewable energy is that \u201cThe most common renewable energy sources like the sun and wind are intermittent or have lower baseload capabilities than coal, natural gas, or nuclear sources. This makes it necessary to have a way to conserve excess energy produced during peak hours. This extra energy can then be supplied through the grid or otherwise when the sun is down, or wind speed reduces.\u201d ([SOURCE](https://www.batterycycle.io/why-is-tesla-focusing-on-the-battery-energy-storage-market/)). As an example to elaborate on how much importance is placed on energy storage, China mandates that all renewable energy facilities must store at least 20% of their total output ([SOURCE](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwiYquPrkuaEAxXuSGwGHffzBkgQFnoECA0QAw&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.forbes.com%2Fsites%2Ferikkobayashisolomon%2F2023%2F12%2F20%2Fenergy-vault-wins-big-with-gravity-storage-in-china%2F%23%3A~%3Atext%3DChina%2520has%2520mandated%2520that%2520all%2Cgeneration%2520capacity%27s%2520worth%2520of%2520storage.&usg=AOvVaw3WMq0w9-2ka0Cz2kAGbCWX&opi=89978449)).\r  \n\r  \nThe closest competitor to TSLA in energy pack is BYD. The TSLA\u2019s megapack is smaller in dimensions compared to BYD and on top of that TSLA has built its own software to be compatible with the megapack hardware with features such as Autobidder (Software to optimize energy trading) and Powerhub.\r  \n\r  \nRight now what's stopping revenue for energy storage is production capacity, TSLA opened its megapack factory in Lathrop to curb this. TSLA has also announced its plans to build a megapack factory in China to assist with production capacity ([SOURCE](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-12-22/tesla-acquires-land-for-shanghai-megapack-battery-factory)). As an overarching goal for my forecast, I took into account the TSLA master plan 3.\r  \n\r  \nWhen forecasting number of dedicated megapack factories opened, I assumed that TSLA would open 1 additional plant every 3 years for the next 10 years, to meet the large surge in demand as countries accelerate their push towards renewable energy.\r  \n\r  \nWhen forecasting Max Output/Factory, taking into account this article on expected output. ([SOURCE](https://www.nextbigfuture.com/2023/11/tesla-megapack-factory-production-limit-solved-and-capacity-will-be-doubled-to-80-gwh.html)). TSLA\u2019s Lathrop Megapack factory can produce 80GWh/Year in part due to them doubling their existing lines and resolving certain issues. Over time I believe that TSLA can massively increase the Max Output/Factory, as TSLA consistently touts their innovations as having an S curve of progression, where progress is slower at the earlier stages before exponentially increasing. \r  \nAs a sanity check, in my base case assuming that all Mega packs are still at 4 MWh. TSLA has to produce 406,200 Mega Packs or 81,240 Mega Pack per factory a year by 2038. As of November 2023, the Lathrop factory can produce 20,000 megapack. So, in 15 years I believe it is a reasonable amount of time necessary for TSLA to ramp up their production 4x.\r  \n\r  \nWhen forecasting %GWh Deployed, I had to assume total output which is a function of max output and the number of gigafatories. I assumed that over the years as more countries begin phasing out ICE vehicles in favor of EVs, there is a larger need to deploy more energy storage so this % increases to a large extent.\r  \n\r  \nWhen forecasting Avg Sales/GWh Deployed, Elon Musk does not like to increase sales through increasing pricing which was why when TSLA enjoyed economies of scale from increasing output in their Lathrop factory the Avg Sales/GWh Deployed decreased. So, applying this principle of TSLA slashing prices when costs decrease due to economies of scale, I assumed that TSLA continued slashing prices before increasing by the perpetual inflation rate.\n\n# Cost:\n\n\r\u201cpredicting auto gross margins is extremely challenging since there are many moving parts to this equation, some of which are out of our control like the change in tariffs or local incentives to name a few. While the teams are focused on cost reductions, we are approaching the limits within our current platforms.\u201d - 2023 Q4 Earnings Conference. \n\n  \nWhen forecasting Automotive and Non-Automtoive COGS, COGS as a %revenue for 2021 and 2022 are likely to be lower due to TSLA pre-emptively increasing sales price to deal with inflation. However, in 2023 COGS as a %revenue increased as TSLA cut back on sales price. Going forward, I\u2019ll assume that TSLA tends towards historic pre-covid average. However, in the long run, as TSLA successfully implements their manufacturing technology this % will decrease even further.  \nWhen forecasting R&D, SG&A, and Others, opting for less granularity I forecasted it as a % of historic averages.\n\n# WACC:\n\nUS 10Y T-Bond (1M Avg) = 4.12%\r  \nBeta ([SOURCE](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA/)) = 2.41\r  \nStable Market ERP ([SOURCE](https://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/datafile/ctryprem.html)) = 4.60%\r  \nCOE = 15.21%\r  \n \r  \nTSLA is rated at BAA3 ([SOURCE](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DBAA))\r  \nCOD (1M Avg) = 5.72%\r  \nMarginal Tax Rate = 21.00%\r  \nAT-COD = 4.52%\r  \n\r  \nMarket Price (5D Avg) = $178.50\r  \nShares O/S = 3184.79M\r  \nMarket Value of Equity = 568485.02M\r  \n\r  \nWeighted Average Maturity = 2 Years\r  \nFY23 Interest Expense = 156M\r  \nMarket Value of Debt = 4578.78M\r  \n%Debt = 0.80%\r  \n%Equity = 99.20%\r  \nWACC = 15.12%\r  \n\r  \nCurrently, TSLA has a very large beta as its stock has increased in volatility in the past few years. However, I believe that this volatility will not persist for very long as most big tech stocks enter a stable stage where their beta tends downwards. So, as a proxy for how low TSLA\u2019s beta will tend to, I looked at other big tech stocks.\n\n\r\n\n|Name|Beta|\n|:-|:-|\n|Google (GOOG)|1.04|\n|Microsoft (MSFT)|0.89|\n|Meta (META)|1.21|\n\nTaking the average beta, we arrive at a beta of 1.05. Assuming similar D/E composition and bond rating. I assumed that it took another 10 years for TSLA to reach the stable state.\r  \n\r  \nStable State COE = 8.95%\r  \nStable State AT-COD = 4.52%\r  \n\rTSLA\u2019s stable stage WACC = 8.90%\r  \n\n\n# Conclusion:\n\nUltimately in my base case, I value TSLA at $186.88 per share. I believe that there is still room for TSLA to grow, having such a strong first movers advantage in the renewable energy market means that TSLA is heads and shoulders above its competitors. I believe that the market is undervaluing the Energy Storage arm of TSLA's business, and less emphasis is placed on this potentially disruptive segment of business. \n\nBase Case: \\[[INSERT](https://imgur.com/a/nZjoZRs)\\]  \nWorst Case: \\[[INSERT](https://imgur.com/a/aMYlmm3)\\]  \nBest Case: \\[[INSERT](https://imgur.com/a/2VOKzoU)\\]  \nSanity Check: \\[[INSERT](https://imgur.com/a/rVQr2uF)\\]  \nRevenue Model (AUTOMOTIVE): \\[[INSERT](https://imgur.com/a/ucXnT5K)\\]  \nRevenue Model (ENERGY STORAGE): \\[[INSERT](https://imgur.com/a/xiRJYhN)\\]  \nCost Model: \\[[INSERT](https://imgur.com/a/KVByje0)\\]  \nChange in NWC: \\[[INSERT](https://imgur.com/a/3rDs1Be)\\]",

    "selftext": "This isn't a post about AI bubble or why the chip and cloud hardware supplier is on a nutty uptrend. Their revenue in cases like NVDA has grew 120%+ YoY with insane profit margin, and since market is short sighted, it makes sense why the insane run. Lot of people kicking themselves for not see this coming, or someone like me who saw it coming but exited earlier because couldn\u2019t value the \u201cshovel\u201d correctly in this gold rush.   \nNow lets take a step back and look at this trend from a different angle. Main buyers are the big 5 Google, OpenAI, META, AAPL, AMZN, MSFT (GOMAM).  \nIn order for your you all to understand my next points we all first have to agree on few basic things  \n**1). Companies have FINITE capex amount**  \n**2). Every company at the end of the day WANTS to make money**  \n**3). Every company wants to find a way to REDUCE their capex and still grow**  \nFor point #2, the way these company will eventually make money is by selling the products to consumer and business. So in next 5-10 years we will see leap in software and services innovations. We will see so many new small and midsize companies using these applications to build more complex solutions on cloud. Now take your guess who will benefit the most from this? if your answer is GOMAM, thats correct. If your answer is NVDA then you are an idiot.   \nI would say point #1 and point #3 go hand in hand, we are seeing lot of capex diverted within the company itself. So to no surprise, GOMAM are already building and some have built their own silicon. Its just matter of time when they start to reduce their exposure to external company. This isn\u2019t to say that NVDA will ever become irrelevant. The point is they will always have to outgrow and justify for GOMAM to spend their capex on them. This is the bet you are making for going LONG nvidia at these valuation. Because again, market is short sighted, they are seeing 6-12 month guidance and pumping.  \nNow i am seeing crazy amount of doom and gloom for companies like AAPL and GOOG lately on reddit and also on media. I just have one question, that goes to #2. How do you guys think every software and services that will leverage these new silicon will reach the end users? Think for a second form a consumer standpoint. They don\u2019t know wtf is NVDA, AMD. All they know is smartphones, tablets, wearable, laptops. I am not saying where you should invest your money. I am just saying don\u2019t go with the trend like a madman. if you miss the shovel rush, you can still make plenty of money on factories that will make gold products for end users.   \n**in summary,**   \n**I see there is more value in going long on GOMAAM (Added AAPL) than NVDA,AMD**",

    "title": "Google (GOOG) DCF Analysis",
    "selftext": "**NOTE NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE**\n\n# Introduction:\n\nGOOG has a very simplistic goal in their business, yet this simple goal managed to carry GOOG's market cap to a trillion dollar. GOOG's main business model is centered around helping consumers sieve through large chunks of data to find what they need or want to find. Recently, with the announcement of Gemini, GOOG's GenAI, it led to a temporary spike in stock prices as investors believed that Gemini would be able to compete with ChatGPT. I believe that the advancement of GenAI is necessary for GOOG given how reliant they are on Search revenue.\n\n# Revenue:\n\nThe success of GOOG\u2019s advertising is hinged on 2 criteria, being able to attract and retain users and being able to monetize advertisers.\n\n***For attracting and retaining users,***\n\n1. GOOG released Gemini their generative AI to help complement Search. This allows users to process information faster or seek answers more efficiently.\n2. GOOG has entered into a deal with AAPL to make Google the default search engine on Safari. This deal is estimated to be worth about 18 billion per year.\n3. There is a large switching cost for long-term users to switch over to a rival search engine. This is so because using the Google search engine means that there is a high chance users will be indoctrinated into the GOOG ecosystem (E.g. Gmail, Google Drive, etc.).\n\n***For monetizing advertisers,***\n\n1. GOOG is one of the largest platforms that advertisers can advertise on. The type of information that users receive is dependent on GOOG, GOOG controls the information flow to consumers and hence is a powerful platform for advertisers to advertise on.\n\nApart from these factors, GOOG has begun targeting SMBs (Small and Midsize Businesses).\n\nHow GOOG sees SMBs (Small, Medium Businesses) advertising with them is that GOOG will provide Gen AI to generate images/captions for their ad campaign then SMBs use these advertising materials and advertise on Search.\n\nWhen forecasting advertising revenue, opting for less granularity, and due to a lack of public data, I lumped both search and YouTube together. Taking the number of YouTube users as a proxy for the popularity of GOOG\u2019s advertising tools.\n\nSo, I assumed that it would take 1 year for GOOG to finish and get Gemini up to speed. I assumed that it takes about 2 years for consumers to get used to Gemini and for advertisers to notice this shift. This quick adaptation is because ChatGPT took off very quickly within the year it was released.\n\nWhen forecasting revenue/users, due to the macro constraints and pessimism advertisers are cautious about advertising so the revenue/users have been dropping for the past 2 years. I assume it takes 2 years for the macro outlook to improve and during the high growth period, revenue/users grow as well as more advertisers start spending more.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen forecasting Google Subscriptions + Others, which entails YouTube premium, GOOG devices, and Google Play revenue. I assumed that the success of this category is based on YouTube Premium so I forecasted this revenue segment based on the number of subscribers to YouTube Premium. Number of Subscribers in 2022 ([SOURCE](https://www.billboard.com/business/streaming/youtube-music-premium-subscribers-how-many-1235594920/#:~:text=That's%20up%20from%20the%2080,at%20the%20end%20of%202021)). Comparing Youtube Music to its strongest competitor Spotify, Spotify has a large switching cost due to years worth of playlists built that would be lost by switching over. On top of that, having to learn the new UI of YouTube Music and the lack of certain features that Spotify users are used to.So, the main driver for this segment would be YouTube Premium, given the indispensable nature of YouTube due to the strong network effect and new frontiers such as YouTube Shorts that are driving people to YouTube, and the longer unskippable ads, all these factors are driving people to subscribe to YouTube Premium. However, I\u2019m cautious about how much or how fast YouTube Premium will grow. Due to strong competitors such as TikTok and Spotify, I\u2019d assume the historic large growth will taper downwards as the high historic growth was due to the low-hanging fruits being picked.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen forecasting Revenue/Users, as GOOG wants to keep their prices low to attract users to YouTube Premium, historically the revenue/users have been declining. However, as recently as July 2023 GOOG started hiking prices. So, I\u2019d assume that in my forecast from FY24 onwards, the Revenue/Users begin rising.  Historic price hikes have been at around 16%, I\u2019d assume that GOOG no longer pursues such aggressive price rises and begins tapering down their price increases. Their perpetual Revenue/users growing in line with the perpetual inflation rate.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen forecasting Google Cloud revenue, since there isn\u2019t available relevant data to create a bottoms-up revenue model I forecasted it as Y/Y growth. Taking into account ([SOURCE](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/cloud-computing-industry)). Given that GOOG mainly offers IAAS and SAAS for cloud computing, as businesses begin ramping up their digital efforts in line with the global push towards digitalization there is an increasing demand for IAAS and SAAS cloud computing, especially for IAAS which is stated to have the highest growth rate. I assumed that GOOG\u2019s cloud revenue grew at a Y/Y CAGR of 19.3%.\n\n# Cost:\n\nWhen forecasting COGS, TAC accounted for about 40% of COGS as per 2023 10-K. I assumed that TAC would tend slightly upwards due to the competition for traffic increasing from competitors such as TikTok.\n\nWhen forecasting R&D and marketing, opting for less granularity I forecasted it as a % of historic averages.\n\nWhen forecasting G&A, management has stated that there is a potential usage of AI to reduce the need for labor. I\u2019d assume that G&A tends downward slightly.\n\n# WACC:\n\nRFR (1M Avg) = 4.14%\n\nBeta ([SOURCE](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOG/)) = 1.06\n\nStable market ERP ([SOURCE](https://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/datafile/ctryprem.html)) = 4.60%\n\nCOE = 9.02%\n\nGOOG has a bond rating of AA ([SOURCE](https://www.moodys.com/credit-ratings/Google-Inc-credit-rating-820429365?lang=es-ar&cy=arg#:~:text=Moody's%20assigns%20Aa2%20rating%20to%20Google's%20senior%20unsecured%20debt))\n\nAA bond yield (1M Avg) = 4.80%\n\nMarginal Tax rate = 21.00%\n\nAT-COD = 3.79%\n\nStock price (5D Avg) = $147.05\n\nShares O/S = 12433M\n\nMarket Value of Equity = 1828272.65M\n\nWeighted Average Debt = 10 Years\n\nFY23 Interest Expense = 308M\n\nMarket Value of Debt = 12769.72M\n\n%Debt = 0.007%\n\n%Equity = 99.003%\n\nWACC = 8.93%\n\n# \n\nConclusion:\n\nUltimately, in my base case, I value GOOG at $143.16 per share. I believe that GOOG is a company with strong growth potential. However, given that GOOG is a household name and especially with the recent hype when they announced gemini it has led to a lot of enthusiasm and bullish outlook that caused their prices to temporarily spike upwards.\n\nBase Case: \\[[INSERT](https://imgur.com/a/N5sTEUE)\\]  \nBest Case: \\[[INSERT](https://imgur.com/a/H6Nwjmt)\\]  \nWorst Case: \\[[INSERT](https://imgur.com/a/9MQJ5r5)\\]  \nRevenue Model: \\[[INSERT](https://imgur.com/a/f1BVoRa)\\]  \nCost Model: \\[[INSERT](https://imgur.com/a/q9kjjCf)\\]  \nSanity Check: \\[[INSERT](https://imgur.com/a/tmtlB4d)\\]  \nChange in NWC Schedule: \\[[INSERT](https://imgur.com/a/TcRANOP)\\]",

It implies that Google Cloud is just crossing above a $36 billion annual run rate. Margins improved - operating margin in Q4 came in at 9% compared to 3% in the previous quarter and (0.2%) in Q4 last year.  \nGoogle Cloud is continuing to close this growth rate gap with Azure, and may surpass Azure leveraging AI. Like AWS and Azure, Google Cloud is seeing strong momentum with AI products, which is helping it win and upsell deals. Management said that the \u201cstrong demand we are seeing for our vertically integrated AI portfolio is creating new opportunities for Google Cloud across every product area,\u201d  \nCEO Sundar Pichai said that \u201cgreater than 70% of gen AI unicorns are using Google Cloud,\u201d and customers including Anthropic and Mistral AI are building and serving LLMs on Google Cloud\u2019s AI Hypercomputer, which combines Google\u2019s \u201cTPUs and GPUs, AI software and Multislice and Multi-host technology to provide performance and cost advantages for training and serving models.\u201d  \n**Is Alphabet monetizing AI? Yes**  \n1. Google Cloud is charging $30/month via subscriptions with Duet AI and management noted that customers are \u201cincreasingly choosing Duet AI\u201d to \u201cboost productivity and improve their operations.\u201d This is a competing product with GPT 4 - Duet AI will incorporate Google\u2019s Gemini, its multi-modal family of LLMs developed to challenge OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4. Google Cloud \"is intensely focused on bringing the benefits of Gemini\u201d to its cloud customers, and the rollout of the top iteration,  \n2. Gemini Ultra, at a $20/month subscription could help Google gain share away from OpenAI and thus Azure while increasing revenue.  \nYou Tube, which grew at 16% was also slightly better than expected at $9.2Bn  \n**Net Profit jumped 52% to $20.69 billion, or $1.64 per share, (This was in spite of $1.2Bn severance charges)**  \nSubscriptions are a $15Bn business now, led mostly by You Tube.  \n**Alphabet is an extremely profitable company, it has an operating profit margin of 27%! \u2014 that too after all the massive spending on other bets such as Waymo, CAPEX on Al, etc.**  \nAlphabet\u2019s earnings should double in the next 4 years to about $10.50 - an 18% growth.  \nI believe it is definitely worth buying at a P/E of 21. The Price to Earnings Growth ratio (PEG)  is just 1.17   - that\u2019s nothing for a market leader, $342Bn behemoth, with a search engine monopoly, and a very strong presence in AI and Cloud.",

Notably, however, Tuesday brings us into August, which has been the weakest month of the year over the last 25 years.\n\n[**Broadening of the market.**](https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/Cj8RJI9cSQHXtbHDpHlEqQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTcwNQ--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-07/134ad610-2fe2-11ee-bf6f-1ffefac75b64)\n\nIn the table above, we can see that the three leading sectors until May were those that house the so-called Magnificent Seven stocks, as well as the growthier names that tend to be less cyclical.\n\nThe Tech sector is home to much of the artificial intelligence trade, including Microsoft (MSFT) and Nvidia (NVDA). Apple (AAPL), which is up some 50% so far this year, is also a member of the Tech sector.\n\nAlphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), along with Meta Technologies (META), is a member of the Communication Services sector.\n\nAnd even with the rally broadening in recent months, we can see Tech is still doing a lot of the heavy lifting. It may not be a surprise, then, to learn that both Apple and Meta have been positive each month this year. (For Meta, the streak of monthly wins extends all the way back to November 2022.)\n\nThrough May, Amazon (AMZN) and other e-commerce plays were primarily responsible for boosting gains in the Consumer Discretionary sector.\n\nIn the two months since, brick and mortar stalwarts like Kohl's (KSS) and Nordstrom (JWN) have joined the rally, with each up over 50% since the end of May.\n\nCyclical names \u2014 whose fortunes vary more alongside the state of the economy \u2014 dominate the components of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI).\n\nAnd inside the index we can also see the game of catch-up taking place.\n\nThe latest returns from June to July are reflected on the x-axis in the chart below, while prior gains through May are expressed vertically on the y-axis.\n\nIndustrial giant Caterpillar (CAT) is alone at the right edge of the chart \u2014 up 29% the last two months after sinking 14% earlier this year. Caterpillar will report earnings on Tuesday.\n\n3M (MMM) and Boeing (BA) are also among top recent returns, while rounding out the top five are banking giant JPMorgan (JPM) and retail leader Home Depot (HD).\n\nAlso noteworthy are the few laggards that haven't mustered much the entire year and are camping out in the lower left of the chart.\n\nConsumer Staples (XLP) company Walgreens (WBA) happens to be dead last on the year-to-date list, down 20%. Telecom company Verizon (VZ) and pharmaceutical giant Merck (MRK) are also toward the bottom.",

    "title": "Nasdaq 100 Plans Special Rebalance To Curb Dominance Of 'Magnificent Seven' (apple, meta, google, Microsoft, Tesla..)",
    "selftext": "From https://www.investors.com/news/nasdaq-100-plans-special-rebalance-to-curb-dominance-of-magnificent-seven/\n\n\n\nThe Nasdaq 100 index is set to adjust the weighting of its 100 components, with the \"magnificent seven\" stocks Microsoft (MSFT), Apple, Nvidia (NVDA), Tesla (TSLA), Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL), Meta Platforms (META) and Amazon.com (AMZN) currently accounting for more than half the index's weight.\n\nThe magnificent seven stocks largely fell Monday.\n\nThe Nasdaq 100 special rebalance will take place before the market open on Monday, July 24, to \"address overconcentration in the index by redistributing the weights.\"\n\nThe weighting changes will be announced on Friday, July 14. No stocks will be added or removed.\n\nThe Nasdaq 100 includes the 100 largest non-financial Nasdaq components.\n\n\nHow Is the Nasdaq 100 Weighted?\nThe Nasdaq 100 index is a modified market-capitalization index. Market valuation is the largest factor, but with methodology to limit overconcentration.\n\nThe seven-largest companies in the Nasdaq 100 account for 55% of the index. It seems likely that this combined weighting will be reduced. It's also likely that there may be notable weighting shifts within these seven giants.\n\nThe current weights show that market capitalization is the dominant factor, but it's not the only one.\n\nMicrosoft stock has the largest weight, at 12.9%, as of July 7. Apple stock has a 12.5% weight, despite having a $2.999 trillion market cap vs. Microsoft's $2.51 trillion.\n\nGoogle stock has a 7.4% weighting with the GOOGL and GOOG share classes combined.\n\nNvidia stock has vaulted to a 7% Nasdaq 100 weighting, thanks to its $1.05 trillion market cap. That's a slightly larger weight than Amazon stock (6.9%), even though the latter has a significantly higher valuation at $1.33 trillion.\n\nTesla stock and Meta Platforms round out the top-seven members, with weights of 4.5% and 4.3%, respectively.\n\nJust for reference, for the entire Nasdaq composite, Apple stock had an 11.4% weighting as of July 7 while Microsoft was at 9.5%. GOOGL stock is at 5.8% while Amazon and Nvidia are at 5.1% and 4%, respectively. TSLA stock has 3.3% share and META stock is at 2.8%.\n\nHow Much Will Nasdaq 100 Megacaps Be Cut?\nBased on Nasdaq 100 methodology, the combined weight of the five companies with the largest market caps will be set to 38.5%. The five-largest companies, Apple, Microsoft, Google, Amazon and Nvidia had a combined weight of 46.7%. That suggests some notable reduced weightings for these names.\n\nMeanwhile, no component outside the top-five market cap companies can have a Nasdaq 100 exceeding the lesser of 4.4% or the weight of the stock with the fifth-largest market valuation. That points to at least a slight decline in TSLA stock's weight.\n\nThe official reweightings should be released on Friday, perhaps after the close. That will also include stocks that will see increased weightings.\n\nMagnificent Seven Soar In 2023\nThe Invesco QQQ ETF (QQQ), which tracks the big-cap Nasdaq index, was up 37.5% in 2023 through July 7. The First Trust Nasdaq 100 Equal Weighted Index ETF (QQEW), which gives an equal weight to all 100 stocks, is up just 18.8%.\n\nThis largely reflects massive moves by megacaps this year. NVDA stock has nearly tripled (191%). META stock has soared 141% while TSLA stock is up 123%. AMZN stock has leapt 54.5%. AAPL stock has run up 47% and MSFT stock nearly 41%. Google stock is up a still-robust 35%.\n\nThere is some concern that this handful of names is distorting the health of the overall stock market, which is likely what's spurring the special rebalancing.\n\nWill Nasdaq 100 Special Rebalance Affect Stock Prices?\nThe Nasdaq 100 special rebalance will spur stock allocation shifts among ETFs such as QQQ and mutual funds that track the index. So there could be some one-off gains or losses, perhaps as the planned changes are announced on July 14.\n\nHowever, the impacts may be modest. For one, the big-cap Nasdaq index is going to adjust weightings, vs. a full addition or deletion. Also, far more money tracks the S&P 500, which is why S&P 500 component changes get a lot more attention than Nasdaq 100 moves.\n\nThe S&P 500 index, unlike the Nasdaq 100, is a pure market-cap weighted index.\n\nMost of the \"magnificent 7\" stocks retreated Monday. Nvidia stock fell just 0.8%, while Apple slipped 1.1%. more than 1% intraday. Microsoft stock retreated 1.6%, TSLA 1.8% and Amazon 2%. GOOGL stock sank 2.5%.\n\nThe one exception: META stock climbed 1.2%, as Meta's new Threads app topped 100 million sign-ups in less than a week.\n\nMegacaps weighed on the Nasdaq 100, which fell intraday before eked out a gain. The equal-weight QQEW jumped 1.8%.",

    "selftext": "I've been trading for a couple of years and lately I've been doing very well by paying attention to relationships and divergences among stocks/ETFs/commodities. Trying to understand and exploit the ebb and flow among sectors. Attempting to identify where long-term accumulation is taking place. First and foremost I watch SPY/QQQ/IWM, ES/NQ/RTY, VIX/VX, DXY/USD, and the 10Y. I also watch the SPDR Sector Funds like XLK, XLF, XLV, XLU, XLY, XLE, XLP, XBI, etc. Additionally, IWC (micro-caps) and IJH (mid-caps). \n\nAnd VTI (whole stock market ETF) and VT (whole world market ETF) I watch on the weekly chart to get a sense for where the world markets are trending in general. I haven't branched into other markets much, mainly focused on identifying \n\n1) where the current strength in the market is \n\n2) whether the market is remaining orderly/non-volatile \n\n3) how much divergence is taking place among sectors/stocks (e.g. last year felt like indiscriminate selling, this year the divergences are tremendous)\n\nFor individual stocks, I basically rifle through stocks with setups that interest me and I really lack organization for what I have on my charts during a trading day. I use Thinkorswim and typically have about 20 charts up across 3 monitors. It's been a challenge to manage my screen real estate and I still change things up all the time, haven't found a solid methodology I guess for what I have pulled up. Undoubtedly what you have pulled up can effect what you trade, how you perceive the market throughout the day, etc. \n\nA lot of times I have AAPL, TSLA, GOOG, AMZN, up at all times. From there I have a mix of stocks from other sectors, maybe a couple wildcards like a small cap/squeeze name. But generally my goal is to display to myself options that I'm unlikely to be severely wrong on, or end up taking a big loss on. I go through and adjust what I'm looking to every night, but admittedly I do need more organization, journaling, and operating more systematically.  \n\nSo what is your process for evaluating the market? Discovering stocks and setups. What do you have open during the trading day? How many charts? Do you purposefully limit what you see? Do you use any websites/tools to organize your watchlist(s)?

    "title": "4 Tech stocks benefiting from the AI boom.",
    "selftext": "The world of artificial intelligence (AI) these days is overwhelmingly dominated by discussions on generative AI and its implications. Simply put, generative AI is a form of machine learning through which AI software can produce text, video, images, and more. Basically, generative AI can produce any form of content on the basis of prompts. This form of AI became more widespread and renowned after the launch of ChatGPT and similar generative AI platforms, which revolutionized the AI sector while pulling in major tech companies to become part of the AI race.\r  \n\r  \nThis form of AI and its impact on the markets was discussed by Jim Stewart, a New York Times columnist, on CNBC's 'Squawk on the Street' on June 16. According to Stewart, big tech companies, especially those that are AI beneficiaries, have been leading the recent stock market rally. These include companies such as Microsoft Corporation ($MSFT), Alphabet Inc. ($GOOG), and NVIDIA Corporation ($NVDA). Stewart claimed that he was bullish on AI, especially considering the fact that this technology could boost productivity gains across different fields, including journalism.\r  \n\r  \n**AI and the US Stock Market**\r  \nIn May, NVIDIA Corporation ($NVDA) joined the group of companies with valuations in trillions of dollars. Many financial professionals today are attributing the gains of the S&P 500 to AI, primarily, with the focus being on NVIDIA Corporation ($NVDA) and other big tech companies that have begun incorporating AI and generative AI in their products and services.\r  \n\r  \nThis overwhelming focus on a select few number of companies that can successfully play the AI boom and come out victorious has led to many investors worrying that the stock market in 2023 will turn into a selection of a few winners and a lot more losers. The S&P 500 has \"basically been the S&P 7,\" a reference to the fact that only seven major tech companies have been calling the shots so far in 2023, leading the market to heavily rely on them and their gains.\r  \n\r  \n**\"You Are At The Starting Line Of AI\"**\r  \nThis reality has led many professionals and corporations to realize that the AI boom is very real and may be here to stay. Companies today will be bound to figure out where they stand in this environment and how they can integrate AI into their business models to reap the benefits of this technological revolution. NVIDIA Corporation's ($NVDA) CEO, Jensen Huang, in an address at the National Taiwan University in May, stated that we are currently at \"the starting line of AI\" and that at this moment, we should run instead of walking. The implications of his statement are many, but perhaps the most obvious lesson to take away from Huang's speech is that companies and individuals today shouldn't be slow to join the AI race - they should try their best to become part of it and ensure they don't end up getting left behind by their competitors.\r  \n\r  \nKeeping the above-mentioned market dynamics and developments in mind, I have compiled a list of the top tech stocks to consider investing in to play the AI boom. I included the obvious stock picks because of their contributions to this industry so far, but I also attempted to find other companies that wouldn't be the first to come to your mind when looking at AI beneficiaries today. \n\n# Our Methodology\r\r\n\nTo select our stocks, I  looked at which companies analysts are expecting to benefit from the AI boom and shortlisted them based on the number of hedge funds holding stakes in them by using Insider Monkey's hedge fund data for the first quarter of 2023. The stocks are ranked based on this metric, from the lowest to the highest number of hedge funds long each of them.\n\n# Tech Stocks Benefiting From The AI Boom\n\n\r  \n**1. Oracle Corporation ($ORCL)**  \n\r  \nOn June 13, Keith Bachman at BMO Capital raised his price target on Oracle Corporation ($ORCL) from $96 to $132. The analyst also holds a Market Perform rating on the stock.\r  \n\r  \nOracle Corporation ($ORCL) is an information technology company based in Austin, Texas. The company's products and services address enterprise information technology environments across the world.\r  \n\r  \nI saw 67 hedge funds long Oracle Corporation ($ORCL) in the first quarter, with a total stake value of $2.9 billion.\r  \n\r  \nTD Cowen's John Blackledge expects Oracle Corporation ($ORCL) to benefit from the current AI boom because its cloud-computing platform can offer it some competitive advantages.\r  \n\r  \nFirst Eagle Investment Management held 20.7 million shares in Oracle Corporation ($ORCL) at the end of the first quarter, making it the largest shareholder in the company.\n\n**2. CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. ($CRWD)**\r  \n\r  \nCrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. ($CRWD) is an information technology company offering cybersecurity products and services. It is based in Austin, Texas.\r  \n\r  \nThere were 72 hedge funds holding stakes in CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. ($CRWD) at the end of the first quarter. Their total stake value in the company was $2.4 billion.\r  \n\r  \nCrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. ($CRWD) may be an interesting stock pick to play the AI boom considering the company has recently announced new AI-powered indicators of attack (IoA) models. These models can combat advanced adversary tradecraft by using machine intelligence to stop breaches.\r  \n\r  \nTal Liani at Bank of America holds a Buy rating on CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. ($CRWD) shares as of June 16. The analyst also raised the firm's price target on the stock from $162 to $190.\n\n**3. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. ($AMD)**\r  \n\r  \nAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc. ($AMD) was spotted in the portfolios of 91 hedge funds in the first quarter, with a total stake value of $4.9 billion.\r  \n\r  \nBased in Santa Clara, California, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. ($AMD) is a semiconductor company that operates globally.\r  \n\r  \nJoseph Moore, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, raised his price target on Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. ($AMD) shares on June 16 from $97 to $138. The analyst also holds an Overweight rating on the shares.\r  \n\r  \nAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc. ($AMD) is a chipmaker that TD Cowen's John Blackledge has picked as one of his tech stocks to play the AI boom. This is unsurprising considering the fact that this June, the company revealed its new AI chip in its race with NVIDIA Corporation ($NVDA). The new MI300X chip was described by Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. ($AMD) as \"the world's most advances accelerator for generative AI.\"\r  \n\r  \nCitadel Investment Group held 13.9 million shares in Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. ($AMD) at the end of the first quarter, making the fund the most prominent shareholder in the company for that quarter.\n\n**4. Adobe Inc. ($ADBE)**\r  \n\r  \nAdobe Inc. ($ADBE) is a diversified software and information technology company based in San Jose, California. The company's flagship product is its Creative Cloud, a subscription service offering members access to its creative products.\r  \n\r  \nJohn Blackledge at TD Cowen sees Adobe Inc.

    "title": "Google(GOOG) DCF: AI",
    "selftext": "# Introduction:\n\nWith all the hype around AI and NVDA, this could be a strong catalyst for launching GOOG into its intrinsic value. Most of the climb had already taken place over the weeks. But, given that currently AI is the flavor of the month I'd be a little worried about adding more positions into GOOG. As a disclaimer, I have positions on GOOG since last year that I've been closing out and cashing in on my gains. I've linked my DCF, Revenue model and Cost model all at the bottom.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# REVENUE:\n\n\r  \n***Cloud***\r  \n%Rev, Cloud is an area gaining massive traction due to how much convenience it adds, And the switching cost of cloud is massive, having to port over the entire database into competitors and retraining employees, so the loyalty of Cloud customers are strong. \r  \nSo, I\u2019d argue that Cloud starts becoming a big part of GOOG\u2019s identity.\r  \n\r  \nY/Y, Cloud grows at CAGR of 19% according to ([SOURCE](https://www.enterpriseappstoday.com/news/cloud-computing-market-size-is-projected-to-surpass-usd-2972-6)). I believe GOOG to be capable of capturing most of that 19%. But, 19% may be overly optimistic as it requires for the next 8 years about 40+% Y/Y which seems unrealistic to me, given how cloud is already such a large part of GOOG. So I used a Y/Y CAGR of 13.32%\r  \n\r  \n***Advertising***\r  \n%Rev, Advertising is still going to be a big part of GOOG\u2019s identity, however with cloud gaining traction Advertising's role may be diminished.   \n\r  \nY/Y, Advertising will see its Y/Y tapering off rather than taking off. I\u2019d argue that the growth of AI related technology like ChatGPT may render GOOG\u2019s search less effective given how ChatGPT seems to be an enhanced Google Search. Luckily, GOOG's has its own contender of ChatGPT, Bard. Bard is trained on Audio data whereas ChatGPT is trained on text data, so the effectiveness of these AI is dependent on how the user inputs data for the AI to process. Ultimately, which AI will take off is dependent on which modal of communication consumers prefer. \r  \nRecently, GOOG has announced its plans to launch Duet AI, AI to help augment the experience on both cloud and Search. It\u2019s definitely a step forward in the right direction, Duet AI could be complementary to Google\u2019s already dominant search as not every search will likely be using AI due to how long that would take. \r  \n\r  \n***Others***\r  \n%Rev, With so many components in Others, there may be less focus placed on this segment of the business so it\u2019ll take a smaller pie of GOOG\u2019s revenue.  \n\r  \nY/Y, I opted to use historical average as granularity seems to be inaccurate here.\r  \n\r  \n\n\n# \r\r\r\rCOST:\n\n\r***TAC***\r  \nGiven the competitiveness of Competing technology against GOOG\u2019s main Traffic generator, I\u2019d argue that it could be significantly costlier to acquire traffic overtime. Recently I've been reading Homo Deus which made a fair point about Dataism. As our data interpreter (AI) gets more and more accurate, you'd be at a disadvantage to not use AI in your day to day life. So if we have this paradigm shift of trusting and relying on AI, TAC has a huge potential of decreasing. But, given how little regulation and promising technology on AI there has been so far this may be either too far out into the future or just impossible entirely.\r  \n\r  \n***COST OF REVENUES***\r  \nGOOG has lumped Content Review, Content Acquisition and Data Centre together in COST OF REVENUES.  \n\r  \n1. Content Review: Needing Employees to manually sieve through content for compliance. As the service gets more popular, more content means needing more employees. (Variable Cost) BUT I'd argue that it could be a negligible one overtime as AI gains dominance and can track content in place of humans. (Fixed Cost)  \n\r  \n2. Content Acquisition: GOOG has stated it uses a cost price model for determining the amount of content acquired. (Variable Cost)  \n\r  \n3. Data Centre: Fixed infrastructure in place, but more of Data center used means GOOG needs higher bandwidth which means higher cost (Variable Cost)\r  \nSince these are variable costs, I\u2019d argue the extent that GOOG can reduce these costs to improve margins are limited.\r  \n\r  \n***R&D***\r  \nR&D the cornerstone of GOOG\u2019s business philosophy will always retain a fixed % of revenue. As evident from historic data where the spread of R&D with respect to Revenue was rather small.\r  \nSo, R&D maintains a fixed % with respect to revenue. But eventually when GOOG matures, I\u2019d argue that R&D tends downwards.\r  \n\r  \n***Sales & Marketing + G&A***\r  \nSales & Marketing + G&A also followed the same historic patterns of R&D where they always occupied the same % with respect to revenue with a small spread.\r  \nSo, Sales & Marketing + G&A occupies a fixed % with respect to revenue. But eventually when GOOG matures and develops a strong branding relies less on marketing so it tends downwards a little.   \n\n\n# \rCOST OF CAPITAL:\n\nWACC calculation a little too messy to input here so I'll link it   \nWACC: ([SOURCE](https://imgur.com/a/D48GrJl))\n\n# CONCLUSION:\n\n\r  \nGOOG is priced at $146.02, GOOG\u2019s recent innovations have been made only in response to competitors. It\u2019s more reactive rather than proactive which may be a bad thing given how strongly ChatGPT has since established its dominance over GOOG. For GOOG to improve its valuation it needs to peer deeper into the AI realm and look towards augmenting AI to compliment its advertising segment e.g. Using AI to help advertisers or to manage Ad Inventory.   \n\n\nDCF: ([SOURCE](https://imgur.com/a/LiT2bkT))  \nREVENUE MODEL: ([SOURCE](https://imgur.com/a/t1ANWPo))  \nCOST MODEL: ([SOURCE](https://imgur.com/a/5CZx1r2))",

I keep some cash (20% of allocated amount) to double down. Is this viable? Risk is that I get some draw downs if there is a big sell-off (but I\u2019ll still hold/double down since I am confident that MSFT is undervalued based on Morningstar reports, their earnings, etc.). Is it a good strategy if I am thinking I just need to cover daily costs (like eating out, for instance)? Is there something I am not seeing? If so, please let me know. I would appreciate any advice.

However, the company has defended its financial position, noting last month it has a low loan-to-deposit ratio. Schwab shares are down 39% year to date.\n*****\n> Bank of America and Morgan Stanley are slated to report earnings Tuesday and Wednesday, respectively. Investors have been eyeing the overall health of the sector after the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank last month spurred a liquidity crisis. Other notable names outside of financials, including electric vehicle heavyweight Tesla will report second-quarter earnings on Wednesday, while Procter & Gamble reports on Friday.\n*****\n> Corporate earnings got off to a positive start last week as banking giants Wells Fargo and JPMorgan Chase beat expectations. But discouraging retail sales data showed a slowdown in consumer spending by 1% in March pulled markets lower Friday.\n*****\n> As companies grapple with sticky inflation and higher rates, many investors have braced for a downbeat earnings reports, but data from Bank of America suggests that this earnings reporting season may already be faring better than expected. Of the companies that reported during the first week, 90% topped EPS estimates. That marks the best beat rate to start earnings season since at least 2012, the Wall Street firm said.\n*****\n> For the week, however, stocks remained resilient.

The transformation usually takes the shape of improved supply chain discipline as well as streamlining business operations in order to achieve better operating margins.\n\nFor the oil and\u00a0[natural gas](https://oilprice.com/admin/articles/Energy/Natural-Gas/Natural-Gas-A-Comprehensive-Guide-To-The-Worlds-Most-Crucial-Fuel.html)\u00a0industry, the moment of truth arrived a few years ago after years of weak benchmark prices, shrinking margins and massive capital flight forced the sector to seriously rethink the way it does business with energy companies increasingly turning toward tech heavyweights for help in cutting costs and streamlining operations.\u00a0\n\nA good case in point is\u00a0[a partnership](https://www.hartenergy.com/news/halliburton-teams-advance-digital-capabilities-microsoft-accenture-188653)\u00a0struck between\u00a0**Haliburton Co.**\u00a0(NYSE:HAL),\u00a0**Microsoft Inc.**\u00a0(NASDAQ:MSFT) and\u00a0**Accenture Plc.**\u00a0(NYSE:ACN) in 2020. For years, Haliburton, one of the world\u2019s largest oilfield services companies, has been plagued by shrinking margins and chronic underperformance. The company eventually made a deal with the two cloud giants to migrate its existing data centers to cloud and enhance digital offerings.\n\n Halliburton is hardly alone.\n\nAfter years of dilly-dallying, oil and gas companies are now rapidly moving their IT infrastructure out to the Cloud as well as adopting Business Process Management (BPM) systems. This frequently results in a leaner, more agile organizational model whilst delivering significant cost savings.\n\nBarclays estimates that the upstream market digital services industry will grow from less than $5 billion in 2020 to a more than $30 billion annual tab by 2025, thus enabling $150 billion in annual savings for oil producers. Opportunities for cost savings include cutting capital expenditures (capex) as well as selling, general and administrative (SG&A) costs and transportation operating costs.\n\nAccording to Barclays, the digital age is finally dawning for the energy sector with the market poised to erupt over the next five years. Over the past few years, Microsoft has struck cloud partnerships with several Big Oil companies including\u00a0**ExxonMobil**\u00a0(NYSE:XOM),\u00a0**Chevron Inc**. (NYSE:CVX) and Haliburton while Google\u2019s parent company\u00a0**Alphabet Inc.**\u00a0(NASDAQ:GOOG)[\u00a0has significantly expanded](https://www.slb.com/newsroom/press-release/2019/pr-2019-0513-slb-google-cloud)\u00a0its partnership with\u00a0**Schlumberger Ltd.**\u00a0(NYSE:SLB), another oilfield services giant. Meanwhile,\u00a0**Amazon Inc.**\u00a0(NASDAQ:AMZN) offers digital services to the industry through Amazon Web Services[\u00a0oil and gas division](https://aws.amazon.com/), and counts\u00a0**BP Plc**. (NYSE:BP) and\u00a0**Shell Plc**\u00a0(NYSE:SHEL) among its top clients.\n\n \n\nIn many cases, Big Oil\u2019s digital makeover is quite extensive.\n\nFor instance, Halliburton kicked off multiple digital transformation projects during the pandemic. Thailand\u2019s PTT Exploration and Production and Kuwait Oil Company were among the notable oil and gas companies that were awarded Halliburton contracts to implement digital transformation and enhance efficiency and production at their oilfields.\u00a0\n\nFor years, Big Oil has been using tech companies\u2019 enterprise software in their highly complex operating systems--including\u00a0 rig management operations and precise drilling techniques. However, they have traditionally been somewhat reluctant to hand over their treasure troves of valuable data mainly on cyber security concerns as well as the need to maintain competitive advantages, preferring instead to develop most of their software developed in-house or by companies within the oilfield services sector such as Haliburton.\u00a0\n\nHowever, this is now changing as they look for ways to improve operational efficiencies in a bid to squeeze higher cash flows and profits from their existing operations.\u00a0\n\nIs the new approach working? The evidence seems to suggest so, with shale drilling costs on an encouraging downtrend.\u00a0**J.P. Morgan**\u00a0estimates that Permian's Delaware Basin oil drillers now require oil prices of just \\~$33/bbl to break even down from $40/bbl in 2019.\u00a0",

    "selftext": "Source: Google Shouldn't Be, But Approaches, A Buffett 10x EBT Stock\n\nThe argument in this article is quite simple: Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) (\"Google\") is undervalued based on the Buffett 10x EBT (earnings before taxes) rule. It is selling at a valuation of around 13x FW EBT only after its cash position is adjusted. At such a valuation, the market essentially views Google as a terminally stagnating business. A 13x FW EBT already provides close to 8% of pretax earnings earning yield, making it equivalent to owning an equity bond with a similar yield (bond yields are all quoted on a pretax basis). Any growth will be a bonus at this valuation.\n\nTo be more specific, as of this writing, Google's stock price is about $98 per share. And my estimate for its 2023 EPS is about $5.8 per share and its tax rate is about 14%. And finally, do not forget that it has about $9 of net cash position sitting on its balance sheet (more on this later). Putting all these numbers together, its current valuations turn out to be ~13x FW EBT after the cash position is subtracted from its stock price.\n\nAt such a valuation, Google is essentially viewed by the market as a terminally stagnating business, according to Buffett's 10x EBT rule.",

    "selftext": "Source: Apple: Why Recent Underperformance Is A Buying Opportunity\n\nOver the last few months, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock has done something that it doesn't often do: underperform. Since the company's last earnings call on October 27th, the stock has broken away from the broader market, returning -4% while the S&P 500 (SPY) has delivered 8.5%.\n\nThe reason for this short-term underperformance isn't exactly obvious. Apple, after all, reported record revenues in its October earnings release, and Tim Cook announced that the company has yet to feel the sting of consumer softness in the economy.\n\nInvestors, however, don't seem to have believed him.\n\nFrom worries about production issues in China to softening demand for the iPhone that investors seem certain will materialize at some point, investors just seem plain worried that something will go awry at the world's largest company. We contend in this article that these concerns are overblown and that the current underperformance represents a buying opportunity.\n\nThe China Worry\n\nApple has faced down a multitude of investor worries regarding its relationship with China. Apple has been accused of being too cozy with China, of making secret deals with China, of having its supply chain being too exposed to China, and of being cowardly when it comes to China.\n\nWhile the veracity of these claims are better left to other authors, we don't think we're overstepping by saying that China has been made into a bogeyman for Apple investors. Apple has arguably done better than almost any other American corporation at walking the fine line that western companies must navigate in order to successfully do business in China.\n\nThe current top-of-mind China worries for Apple investors, however, are supply-chain issues and questions surrounding lockdowns and China's notorious zero-COVID policy. As long as the country is locking up millions of its citizens in forced isolation, things will be difficult for Apple.\n\nInvestors were delivered good news recently, then, when Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal reported that Chinese officials were scaling back COVID lockdowns, potentially re-opening the economy at a much faster pace than expected. Importantly, Vice Premier Hiu Le told an audience at Davos that Beijing's focus this year would be on \"boosting domestic demand.\"\n\nIn other words, we believe that Chinese leadership's struggles with large scale problems such as population decline and slumping economic growth make it less likely to rock the boat with Apple, at least in the near term.\n\nAll of this bodes well for Apple's business in China, which beat analyst estimates last quarter with $15.6 billion in revenue. Apple further stands to gain in the near term from the collapse of the U.S. dollar's 2022 rally.\n\nA strong dollar reduces a company's international sales because when revenues are recorded in dollars (as Apple's are), they must be converted. When one Yuan converts to fewer and fewer dollars, the effects on the income statement quickly mount. Thus, the dollar's recent decline is good news for Apple and American companies conducting business overseas in general. The easing of FX headwinds should give Apple's international sales--and Chinese sales in particular--a welcome boost.\n\nA Robust Product Pipeline\n\nSteve Jobs is rumored to have said at one point that Tim Cook wasn't \"a product guy.\" The long line of releases that Apple has in store for 2023 would probably beg to differ.\n\nOnly three weeks into the new year, Apple has already re-launched its HomePod product as well as a slew of new Mac variations. A full list of potential releases can be found here, but amidst the rumors of an Apple Car, something else very interesting has emerged--an Apple VR headset, reportedly ready for launch this year.\n\nThis is the product that, we think, should keep Mark Zuckerberg awake at night. Meta (META) has been at the forefront of the VR headset realm for some time since it purchased Oculus in 2014. Widespread adoption of the technology, however, has been a bit slow to catch on, which could have something to do with the fact that Meta is not principally a hardware company.\n\nApple, of course doesn't have this problem. If the product does in fact launch in 2023, we expect that it will be maniacally engineered and deliver a user experience unmatched by current technology. Combine this with Apple's dedicated user base and app ecosystem, as well as Apple's influence with developers, and it's quite possible to envision Apple launching VR adoption into the mainstream.\n\nHistory is on our side with this claim. At its launch the iPad was met with a notorious level of criticism. Many companies had attempted to create a tablet in previous years (including Apple--remember the Newton?), but just couldn't quite pull it off. The Apple Watch, too, was met with similar skepticism.\n\nIn short, if anyone can pull off a VR coup, we believe Apple can.\n\nA Compelling Valuation\n\nOver the past five years, Apple's stock has maintained a fairly consistent relationship to forward EBITDA.\n\nOverlaid against each other, the stock has consistently tracked above forward EBITDA estimates. In 2022, estimates began to flatten as inflation took hold and recession fears set in and the relationship reversed, with the stock price falling beneath forward EBITDA. We believe that the current inversion of this historical relationship presents an attractive opportunity for investors. This reflects our belief that Apple's stock won't be stuck in the doldrums forever.\n\nAnalysts, too, believe that Apple has better days ahead.\n\nOf the 45 analysts estimates tracked, the average price target is $168.82. With its current price of $135, Apple has an almost 25% upside to its consensus target.\n\nNormally we take analyst targets with a grain of salt, but an interesting pattern seems to emerge in the lower pane of the above chart--each time Apple's stock price slumps causing the distance between price and target price to exceed 20%, the stock tends to respond to the upside.\n\nSome investors may agree up to this point but wonder--why, in the face of rising interest rates, does Apple continue to deserve such a premium valuation? Shouldn't Apple, at some point, be affected by the same gravity that has pulled down the likes of Amazon (AMZN) and Alphabet (GOOG) (GOOGL) in the last year?\n\nWe're glad you asked, because a piece of the Apple puzzle that we believe is under-reported is the company's sheer efficiency. Apple's business is simply an earnings machine, reporting world-class returns on capital quarter after quarter.\n\n\nIn the last 10 years, Apple has averaged an eye-popping 23.7% quarterly return on capital, and performance over the past two years has been even stronger. For reference, we prefer return on capital over other metrics such as return on equity since ROC can be directly compared to a company's estimated cost of capital. Comparing those two figures is helpful in inferring the profitability and sustainability of a business.\n\nNow, just for kicks, let's compare Apple's reported ROC with Alphabet and Amazon.\n\nIt isn't even close. Compared with Apple's 23.7% ROC, Alphabet's average quarterly ROC over 10 years was 12.3% (the bars in white), while Amazon's was 5.7% (the bars in red).\n\nApple really is that good.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nIn sum, we believe that Apple shares present a highly compelling opportunity for investors.\n\nApple's business is world-class, with best-in-industry returns on capital that continue to justify a premium valuation.\n\nFears about China--including FX headwinds--may dissipate or prove less impactful than feared.\nApple continues to innovate and is expected to bring fresh products to market in 2023.\n\nThere currently exists a price-EBITDA discrepancy which could present a compelling entry or position building point.\n\nWe believe a price of $165 for Apple is a fair target. That price represents a 24x multiple on estimated 2024 earnings, which is well within the stock's historical multiple trading range. We believe the premium multiple is justified for the reasons outlined above.",

    "selftext": "( current investment = \\~1000 in GOOG and GOOGL )\n\nI really like google due to two reasons: **its \"conglomerate-like\" build, as well as its experimentation.**\n\nWith major positions surrounding the tech industry from **Google Search**, to YouTube, to the Pixel Phone, to the Android OS, to the Google Nest, to Chromebooks, to Google Drive & Gmail and more! There's so many different areas in the tech space which Google either conquers (in terms of Google Search which holds close to 85% of search engine use according to [Statistica](https://www.statista.com/statistics/216573/worldwide-market-share-of-search-engines/#:~:text=As%20of%20December%202022%2C%20online,share%20of%20around%2084.08%20percent).\n\nGoogle also owns the 2nd most used social media **Youtube**, according to [Statistica](https://www.statista.com/statistics/272014/global-social-networks-ranked-by-number-of-users/). Youtube maintains its place as \"the place to go for long-form video watching.\" DIY, its on YouTube. You need to learn something? It's on Youtube. They make most of their Youtube money through the advertising, yet they also make money through Youtube Premium and Youtube TV. YouTube Premium is able to profit off of content that millions make and just have to give a commission to the creators rather than using funds before making it like Netflix and other streamers must do for their content. \n\n**YouTube TV** gives Google the ability to compete in the expanding streaming industry against giants such as Netflix and Disney. They have a built-out subscription model which collects revenue monthly through its users.\n\nGoogle's ownership of **Android**, as well as the Pixel phone hardware line gives them a vertical integration in order to have a more powerful stance over the abilities of their phones. This gives them more options for supply chain management and optimization as well as they don;t have to rely on another company for implementation of the hardware itself.\n\nThe **Google Play Store** is also one of the only competitors to the App Store. [It generated 10.34 billion in JUST Q3 of Last year](https://www.businessofapps.com/data/app-revenues/). Several million have used the store in order to install apps, as well as many creators prefer it to the app store, due to its more lax rules on app requirements.\n\n**Chromebooks** as well as the Google Workspace are huge revenue-generating segments that intertwine Google with education (as kids in school are using Chromebooks and Google Classroom) as well as the professional world. While Chromebooks may not be extremely powerful machines, they address a market for the people who simply want a simple computer that they can complete simple online tasks with. Google sold roughly [30 million Chromebooks](https://www.statista.com/statistics/749890/worldwide-chromebook-unit-shipments/) in 2022 alone, showing that demand is for sure still there.\n\nGoogle has **Google Workspace**, a fierce competitor to Microsoft's 365 (Office). While Microsoft does conquer this product type, Google does hold a fair amount of market share and recognition in its Google Workspace (G Suite) product. \n\nGoogle is also working on **Flutter**: an open-source UI software development kit which is used to develop cross-platform applications for Android, iOS, Linux, macOS, Windows, Google Fuchsia, and the web from a single codebase.\n\nGoogle also has several different speculative \"moonshots\" as they refer to them which furthers Google place as an \"unconventional\" company which can use its innovative edge to pass competitors and conquer the industries in which it involves itself with.\n\nHence, why I like the GOOG and GOOGL stock :)",

    "title": "Amazon(AMZN) DCF Analysis need criticisms and advice",
    "selftext": "# HISTORY:\n\nThe story of AMZN is one of trials and tribulation, it was not always smooth sailing where valuation steadily rose over the years. Rather, it was one that required a visionary CEO, one who had sufficient foresight to take gambles that paid off, one who could stomach the choppy seas of business cycles, one who had the determination and patience to see through their largest gambles. Having a humble beginning, AMZN\u2019s IPO MC was valued at $430 Million before losing 95% of their valuation in the tech bubble crash. AMZN managed to survive the tech bubble crash but their valuation held rather steady at around 17 billion in the early 2000s. Meaning investors believed that AMZN could no longer grow past this threshold and have matured. Reaching 17 billion in valuation by itself would\u2019ve been an impressive feat but it wouldn\u2019t be enough for a story worthy for the history books as companies like WMT had a valuation of about 200 billion at the same point in time. AMZN released prime in 2005, their X factor to differentiate themselves from their competitor. Net income was 588 million that year but due to large investments into prime net income in 2006 fell to 190 million nearly 67%. Consequently, from 2005 to 2006 AMZN's MC fell nearly 20%  as investors did not fully believe in prime. But Jeff Bezos, believing in his dream for fast shipping, was unfazed by the whole ordeal and carried on investing heavily into the retail business. And this investment paid off as today we know AMZN as the 5th largest company by market cap in the world.\n\nTl;dr: Jeff Bezos I love you please sponsor my University fees.\n\n# INTRODUCTION:\n\nAMZN business model involves a few revenue sources, in no particular order.\n\n1. Online Retail + Physical Store (AMZN Store): Their online retail website that generates the bulk of revenue, as physical stores have mostly stagnated and occupy a meager amount of revenue I'll combine both Online Retail and Physical Store into AMZN store in my DCF.\n2. Amazon Web Services(AWS): Their cloud computing services which helps take businesses big and small into the cloud. Providing servers as well for firms. Brian Olsavsky described AWS as a business that helps firms change their fixed cost into variable cost, meaning firms pay more as they use more.\n3. Third Party Services(3P): AMZN has extended their retail transport capabilities to their competitors allowing third party to set up their store on the webpage, leaving the problem of transporting the goods to AMZN.\n4. Advertising: The latest significant addition to AMZN's top line, AMZN sold the capability for advertisers to have their products more visible to customers on their retail store and providing tools for advertisers to analyze the data collected.\n5. Subscription: Lastly, Amazon Prime. Consisting of Prime video, Prime Gaming and Prime shipping.\n6. Others: representing the other businesses that AMZN has tried breaking into like Twitch but for simplicity sake and because Others represented about 0.5% of revenue in 2021 I'll not forecast this in my DCF.\n\n# REVENUE:\n\n**AMZN store**:  \n2022, Retail has been hit pretty hard due to inflationary pressures and Ukraine War bumping up costs. Retail has definitely taken a hard beating for 2022. As per 2022 Q3 earnings transcript, \"reduction in fulfilment and transportation capital investment...to better align with demand.\" We can expect revenue to have taken a hit and definitely lower than 2021's 22% Y/Y.\n\nPast 2022 however, I expect AMZN store to pick up as there is a large demand for the convenience provided by AMZN.  \"more than 90 percent of consumers expect two- to three-day delivery as the norm, while 30 percent expect same-day delivery.\" - [(JPMorgan,1)](https://www.jpmorgan.com/solutions/treasury-payments/insights/why-shopping-has-changed-forever). Only AMZN is well situated in terms of fulfillment center, transportation and capacity for expansion to meet this goal. In fact, AMZN is expected to be the largest e-commerce platform world wide by 2027 [(Statista,2)](https://www.statista.com/statistics/379046/worldwide-retail-e-commerce-sales/) earning about 1.2 Trillion.\n\nAMZN store is likely to have very high growth going into 2023 until at least 2025. It took AMZN about 2 years to double their fulfilment network from 2019 - 2020 hence the negative cash flows back then. So I'm assuming AMZN is going to be an aggressive grower with high revenues and low margins as AMZN will be expanding into new markets it'll probably minimally need to spend another 2 years doubling its current size. Hence I project high growth period from 2023 - 2025.  \n\n\n**AWS:**  \n2022, firms are likely to be more conservative in these uncertain times preferring to have more cash reserves in hand. AWS offers a pay-as-you-go approach, not requiring firms to tie up large capital into AWS and AWS helps business to reduce cost. As per 2022 Q3 earnings transcript, \"we've seen an uptick in AWS customers focused on controlling cost\" All that being said, I don't really expect any crazy amount of growth in AWS as companies are more likely to have their capital tied up in footing the bill for higher labor cost. Even management forecast growth \"more in the mid 20% growth rate\". Compared to 2021's Y/Y at 37.1% so 2022's Y/Y is about 13% lower than 2021's Y/Y growth rate.\n\nAWS is likely to have high growth as well going into 2023 as management announces plans to introduce AWS to more regions \"launch of the AWS middle east region in August and the recent announcement to launch AWS Asia Pacific.\" The cloud computing is a whole new realm of endless opportunities for Amazon to capitalize on, with the market expected to grow from 548 billion in 2022 to 1240 billion in 2027, [(marketsandmarkets,3)](https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Market-Reports/cloud-computing-market-234.html) AWS being in a good spot at about 38% market share as of Q1 2022, [(statista, 4)](https://www.statista.com/statistics/967365/worldwide-cloud-infrastructure-services-market-share-vendor/) to capitalize on this large market. Similarly I expect high growth period from 2023 - 2025.  \n\n\n**3P:**  \nI was thinking about how exactly should I go about forecasting third party but due to a lack of available data I actually forecast 3P with respect to AMZN store.\n\nOf course this was not just a random guess, 3P has always observed a direct relationship with AMZN store. Taking 3P revenue as a percentage of AMZN store from 2016 - 2021 that number has held steady at  a range of 25% - 43%, it makes logical sense as well for 3P to have a direct relationship with AMZN store as 3P are retailers facing the same economical environment faced by AMZN store.\n\nSo throughout my DCF, I took 3P's revenue as 33% of AMZN store, 33% is the average of 25% and 43%.3P undergoes same growth period Y/Y as AMZN store.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Subscription:**  \nSubscription was treated the same as 3P. My rationale for this was that you have to use AMZN store in order for a subscription to Amazon Prime to be useful for you. At least anecdotally, barring lord of the rings I have not really heard of any memorable titles on Prime Video. In fact, \"Seventy-nine percent of Amazon Prime users cite **free shipping** as the primary reason they subscribe to the service\", [(chainstoreage,5)](https://chainstoreage.com/technology/the-no-1-reason-people-subscribe-to-amazon-prime-is#:~:text=Seventy-nine%20percent%20of%20Amazon,%2C%20Twitch%2C%20or%20other%20benefits).\n\nSubscription from 2016 - 2021 when taken as a percentage of AMZN store held steady at a range of 7% - 13%.\n\nSo throughout my DCF, I took Subscription's revenue as 10% of AMZN store, 10% being the average of 7% and 13%. Subscription undergoes same growth period Y/Y as AMZN store.  \n\n\n**Advertising:**  \n2022, I'd expect advertising to fall as the advertising industry has proven to be a cyclical one. Using GOOG as a proxy for example, advertising revenue for GOOG actually decreased Y/Y in Q3 so similar results can be expected for AMZN.\n\nI won't expect very high growth for Advertising however as it is quite limited in terms of what can be advertised as compared to GOOG. For example, GOOG is able to advertise service companies but AMZN may not be able to advertise services on the retail webpage.\n\nRegardless, AMZN is still a strong player in the advertising industry. By 2023, AMZN is expected to earn 7.1% of revenue in the digital advertising market worldwide, [(statistia,6)](https://www.statista.com/statistics/290629/digital-ad-revenue-share-of-major-ad-selling-companies-worldwide/).\n\nI wouldn't expect much high growth for advertising as not much exciting news or technology was introduced for advertising that would significantly increase revenue.  \n\n\n# EBIT:\n\nAs per Q3 2022 earnings transcript, \"drop in operating margin...we're working hard to make sure that current profitability is not the new normal.\" Margins have taken a hit in 2022 due to higher labor costs from the tighter labor market and the Ukraine War affecting gas prices which affects energy prices affecting AWS' margins. I'd expect 2022's margins to be smaller than historical margins. The latest 3Y average margin was at 5.47%. Due to AMZN starting to lay off workers on 4th Jan 2023, I'd assume the margins were hit pretty hard, for them to have to further reduce expenses. Margins assumed at 4.5%.\n\nAMZN's margins are not likely to significantly increase from 2023 - 2025 as AMZN is going to continue heavily reinvest back into the company so margins are most likely to go back to the norm of 5.47% by 2025 at the end of the high growth period.\n\nBut, as AMZN goes off their high growth period from 2026 onwards, margins are going to increase as they stop focusing on growing their business but start to become mature. I'd assume margins are about 9% by the end of my forecast period in 2031.  \n\n\n# ASSUMPTIONS:\n\n1. Taxes are taken to be 20%, 2021's tax rate was 19.26% so I'd assume in this similar conditions as closely as possible taxes are about 20%.\n2. D&A taken to be 7% with respect to revenue, historically from 2016 - 2021 D&A with respect to revenue on average was 7%.\n3. Other Ops Exp/Inc and Deferred income tax was omitted from being forecasted despite appearing on the cash flow statement as they were too meager so I opted for less granularity and omitted them.\n4. Change in NWC taken to be -0.5% with respect to revenue, historically from 2016 - 2021 the average was -0.5%\n5. CapEX assumed to be 11% for the high growth period from 2022 - 2025. Before decreasing to reflect a maturing company. A picture of CapEX and D&A side by side: [https://imgur.com/qfOJPNF](https://imgur.com/qfOJPNF)   \npositive net asset balance was taken throughout forecast period.\n6. TGR taken to be 2%.\n7. WACC is taken at 9.2%, Calculations is as such.  \nReference taken from here: [https://imgur.com/a/yM8is8V](https://imgur.com/a/yM8is8V) when calculating %equity and %debt I took long term debt, other long term liability and total shareholder's equity.  \nCOD = taking AMZN\u2019s historic bond yield[(Market Insider,7)](https://markets.businessinsider.com/bonds/amazoncom_incdl-notes_201717-27-bond-2027-us023135bc96) and AA corporate bond yield average [(Ycharts,8)](https://ycharts.com/indicators/us_corporate_aa_effective_yield#:~:text=Basic%20Info,long%20term%20average%20of%204.07%25) at 4.7%  \n%debt = (58919 + 22259)/ (58919 +22 259 + 137489) = 34%  \n%equity =  137489/(58919 +22 259 + 137489) = 66%  \nRisk Free Rate(RFR) = 3.6%, US 10Y Treasury Yield  \nMarket Beta = 1.34 taking the average from Aswath Damodaran (1.49) and Yahoo Finance(1.19)  \nRisk Premium = 5.94% taken from Aswath Damodaran (It's an EXCEL so I can't link it)  \nCOE = 11.5%\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# QUESTIONS & NOTES:\n\n1. **WHY DID I GUESS AWS AND AMZN STORE ARE THE COMPONENTS GOING THROUGH HIGH GROWTH?**  \nAs per 2021 Q4 earnings transcript, \"40% of that capex is going into infrastructure, most of it feeding AWS...About just under 30% is fulfillment capacity, building warehouses -- warehouse only, not transportation. And then just under 25% is transportation capacity and building on our NACL network, principally globally.\" So we can see AMZN believes in the growth of AMZN store and AWS so I think it's justified in my DCF to assume high growth for both.\n2. **WHY DOES HIGH GROWTH STOP IN 2025?**  \nAMZN\u2019s actual valuation is very heavily dependent on how long the high growth period lasts for. No guidance was given for how long this period is going to be, but a decent guess for this would probably be 2 years from 2023. 2022 was a period of contraction from AMZN navigating higher labor costs and the Ukraine War. 2023 would be a good starting point for AMZN to begin expansion. Given that the AMZN network took 2 years to double. If 2 years later it doubles again to quadruple it is most likely able to also support other regions outside of the US to a competent degree.\n3. **INACCURACY IN FORECASTING ADVERTISING**  \nData available for advertising is actually quite limited due to a lack of information from management and historically advertising has only been reported from 2019 onwards. As more financial reports become available for advertising the degree of accuracy of prediction increases, unfortunately only 3 years of data from 2019 - 2021 is available. The story for advertising business in AMZN is sadly just too murky and vague right now for me to paint you guys a decent scene.\n4. **How much AMZN\u2019s margins are actually going to be after the high growth period?**   historically AMZN always had low margins as they reinvested back heavily to the company. Once again a lack of suitable historical data, where we can observe how high margins could be with an average economical condition and with all investments paying off. 9% may be cutting it too little for AMZN, but better safe than sorry.\n5. **LASTLY,**   \nAll my forecasting are based on me weighing all the factors and adjusting their impact according to how much impact I think they have. \n\n# CONCLUSION:\n\nUltimately, I value AMZN at $115.61, it is undervalued compared to market's $84. This difference can probably be attributable to how strong the market thinks AMZN's high growth will be compared to mine. But, I do think that there are a lot of doomsayers especially in the news where literally every other day I'd open my preferred news app and see at least 3 different article about how inflation has not eased off to a great extent. Barring short term expectations, I really do see AMZN being a strong company with great free cash flow potential. 2022's 10-K is definitely going to make or break how investors view AMZN moving forward, Questions like \"Can AMZN finally break their negative CF?\" will finally have an answer and give investor some kind of confidence. 4/5 of AMZN's revenue sources are cyclical so they'd be overly affected by the current environment's pessimism.   \nI see this 37% of difference in price not as risk but rather as an opportunity because I believe AMZN will minimally bounce back 37% sometime in the future, the question is just when.\n\nFor the last time, I appreciate any advice or comments on my DCF I really spent quite a lot of time on this DCF juggling between scouring for data and army left me literally devoting 70% of my weekends getting data. I've read the story AMZN has told and retold it in my own account and I hope this value adds to anyone even if no advice was given!\n\nScreenshot of my excel: [https://imgur.com/a/0QggSox](https://imgur.com/a/0QggSox)",

Companies were \u201cgood buys\u201d with p/e of 30+ or Tesla/amazon of 100+. Now I know that isn\u2019t always or normally a good P/E to buy a company. \n\n\n\nWhat is everyone\u2019s opinions on a good P/E for different sectors? For example $CROX is currently at a P/E of 10. I bought in when it was at 8 because I figured that\u2019s a great buy. It worked out for me but I was ignorant because I don\u2019t actually know if that\u2019s normal for clothing/shoe industry. \n\n\nHow about GOOG at 17? Is this normal for tech pre 2019? \n\n\nHD at 20? Seems high imo but it\u2019s a solid company. \n\n\nLMT at 22 also seems high. But in a bear market it\u2019s slow and steady gains/dividends. But no real growth. \n\n\nAny insight on what normal P/E is in a bear market or normal bull market would be helpful. To me it doesn\u2019t all make sense with GOOG having a lower P/E than HD or CROX. Is everything still overpriced or is this normal?",

For simplicity sake, the first paragraph of each year will be %of revenue from Advertising, Cloud and Others. Second paragraph of each year will be Y/Y growth from Advertising, Cloud and Others.\n\n**Cloud:**  \n**2022:**  \n% forecast: Due to covid, businesses were pushed to go digital so firms are more receptive to automation so Cloud is likely to take up a larger portion of revenue over time.  \n\n\nY/Y forecast: The average of 2020 - 2021 is taken when forecasting Y/Y cloud 2022 as these took into account the effects of covid, however a limitation recognised here would be that in 2022 high inflation led to high interest rates so Y/Y growth may not be so high.  \n\n\n**2023 - 2024:**  \n**%** forecast: I forecast that cloud will start taking up a larger percentage of revenue as the Fed do expect interest rates to come down by end of 2024 when interest rates fall businesses are likely to be able to invest in the business and automate.\n\nY/Y forecast: Due to a lack of industry knowledge I\u2019m going to be conservative and assume a slightly higher than historic growth rate of 2% Y/Y per year from 2023 to 2024.\n\n**2025 - 2026:%** forecast: I estimate cloud will probably peak at about 15% due to tougher competitions from AWS and market saturation.\n\nY/Y forecast: Due to the full effects of falling interest rates finally showing up due to the lag in policy in 2025, Y/Y increase is going to spike higher than past forecasted years.\n\n**2027 - 2030:%** forecast: I estimate that cloud will probably plateau at about 13.5% onwards.\n\nY/Y forecast:  Revenue is plateaued to 47% as a conservative estimate\n\n**Advertising:**\n\n**2022:**% forecast: Advertising is going to decrease in terms of % of revenue due to decrease in retail spending and tougher inflation environment.\n\nY/Y forecast: To prevent Y/Y growth from being skewed by 2020 Covid, I only took the average of 2018-2019 where advertisers had the confidence of spending on advertisement without taking covid into consideration.\n\n**2023 - 2025:**% forecast: Advertising is going to decrease in 2023 and 2024 due to high interest rates and uncertain environment for investors. A conservative 1% was used in decline as advertising is still GOOG\u2019s core operations.\n\nY/Y forecast: Y/Y growth is assumed to be more conservative as advertising is a matured business of GOOG. But 2025 Y/Y growth will be higher due to lower interest rates.\n\n**2026 - 2030:**% forecast: GOOG is likely to continue being a strong seller of advertisements and their expansion into different modal for google searches is likely to keep their advertisement revenue high.Y/Y forecast: Y/Y growth is harder to forecast due to uncertainty in interest rates policy from 2025 onwards.**Others:**% forecast: I\u2019m uncertain of how exactly to accurately depict others but it is not something that GOOG focuses on especially when you listen to their past few earnings calls. So % I\u2019ll just use others to top up till 100%\n\nY/Y forecast: Y/Y growth I\u2019ll assume plateaus at about 18% due to strong competition from Apple.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**EBIT:**\n\nThe average of 2020 and 2021 were taken when forecasting 2022 as 2020 was when there were high layoffs due to covid uncertainty and 2021 was when there was low interest rates that allowed companies to reinvest more than usual.\n\nGOOG is still reinvesting large sums back into cloud so EBIT is taken to decrease till 23% with reference to 2018 and 2019 where it seemed like a steady margin and the most efficiently run GOOG was.To be conservative I\u2019ll just assume EBIT goes to 20% by the end of my forecast period.\n\n**Taxes:**\n\nDue to GOOG being high in R&D I\u2019d assume Taxes hold steady at 20% throughout my forecast.\n\n**D&A:**\n\nAssumed to be at 7% throughout\n\n**Deferred Taxes:**\n\nBeing a relatively small line item, I assume that deferred taxes are going to get smaller as GOOG would probably know how to value their PP&E properly as more time goes on. But since it is a small line item, I just put it at a constant 1% to avoid over or undercompensating for it,\n\n**Change in NWC:**\n\nAssumed to be at 1% throughout\n\n**CapEX:**\n\nI assume GOOG is going to ramp up CapEX going into 2025 due to interest rates expected to be lowered by then. But over time as Cloud becomes matured I don\u2019t see CapEX taking up a large portion so I tend it towards 10% just above D&A\n\n**WACC:**\n\nCOE, GOOG does not pay dividend yield so most of COE comes from average % price increase in its stock.I\u2019d assume GOOG has a market beta of the average between 1.25 and 1.06  based on [https://pages.stern.nyu.edu/\\~adamodar/New\\_Home\\_Page/datafile/Betas.html](https://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/datafile/Betas.html) GOOG is classified under information services?

    "title": "Facebook Parent Meta Ordered to Sell Giphy After Losing Fight in U.K.",
    "selftext": "Facebook META -0.11%\u25bc owner Meta Platforms Inc. META -0.25%\u25bc said it would sell its social-media animated-images company Giphy after the U.K.\u2019s top competition authority affirmed an earlier order to undo the 2020 acquisition.\n\nFacebook\u2019s announcement all but ends a yearslong saga in which a foreign regulator made a rare intervention in an already-consummated deal between two American companies. British regulators had ordered Meta to operate Giphy separately while the deal was under review.\n\nMeta, then known as Facebook, bought Giphy in May 2020 for $315 million. The company, with offices in New York City and Los Angeles, allows users to search for, create and share short animated videos, or GIFs, which have become popular in social-media posts, texts and other communications.\n\nThe U.K.\u2019s Competition and Markets Authority initially ordered Meta to sell Giphy last year. Meta appealed the decision. In July, the Competition Appeal Tribunal backed the CMA in five out of six challenges to the CMA ruling. On Tuesday, after taking that ruling into consideration, the CMA issued a revised decision that again ordered Meta to sell Giphy.\n\nMeta said it is disappointed by the order, but it won\u2019t appeal the decision further. The company said it would work with the CMA to sell Giphy and is awaiting more details in the coming weeks from the regulator about how it should do so.\n\nThe decision comes as the CMA is asserting itself on the global stage as a technology regulator\u2014opening antitrust cases against tech companies alongside others stemming from the U.S. and European Union. The CMA has open cases looking at issues including how Alphabet Inc.\u2019s GOOG 0.91%\u25b2 Google brokers ads on third-party websites, and the control that the regulator says Apple Inc. and Google exercise over mobile-phone software. The companies say they comply with competition rules and are working with the regulator.\n\nMeta\u2019s acquisition of Giphy \u201cwould significantly reduce competition in two markets,\u201d said Stuart McIntosh, chairman of the investigative team appointed by the CMA to review the deal. By buying Giphy, Mr. McIntosh said Facebook had removed a \u201cpotential challenger in the U.K. display ad market, while also giving Meta the ability to further increase its substantial market power in social media.\u201d A sale of Giphy is the only way to address the issue, he said.\n\nMeta had said in the past that consumers and Giphy are better off with the infrastructure and resources Meta can provide. The company said at the time of the deal that it would integrate Giphy into its Instagram platform.\n\nThe CMA began probing Meta\u2019s Giphy deal soon after it was announced. Last fall, it fined Meta 50.5 million pounds, equivalent to $57.2 million, saying the company had failed to provide required updates outlining its compliance with the initial enforcement order in relation to the merger review. Meta at the time disputed the fine for what the company called a \u201cbest effort compliance approach.\u201d\n\nThe move by the CMA isn\u2019t an unprecedented one. In April 2020, it blocked Sabre Corp.\u2019s tie-up with rival travel booking service Farelogix Inc., saying it was anticompetitive. The regulator said the deal could have reduced innovation in the sector and led to higher fees for certain products.  \n\n[https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-parent-meta-ordered-to-sell-giphy-after-losing-fight-in-u-k-11666100289?st=czm35yq7g763bj6&reflink=share\\_mobilewebshare](https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-parent-meta-ordered-to-sell-giphy-after-losing-fight-in-u-k-11666100289?st=czm35yq7g763bj6&reflink=share_mobilewebshare)",

    "selftext": "When the market turns around is anyone's guess. If I had to speculate I say we have a slight bounce in the coming weeks. I say this because it is common knowledge that October-January are the best months in the stock market if you look at history. Likewise, after the midterms in the second year of a president's term we tend to do well in the stock market. The reasoning behind this is because the stock market likes to have certainty on what policies will be approved or denied in the future. Will I be buying during this false bounce? Yes, I will be buying up a little into TQQQ to swing trade over the course of a few days here and there, selling once I make a 12% gain in under 4 days. \n\nNow for the meat and potatoes. What will you be buying up when the news eventually comes out that we are no longer having severe inflation problems? The perfect scenario would be Jerome Powell announces \"we are no longer going to remain hawkish, inflation is now under control ...\" and the rest will be history. Here is a breakdown of my portfolio picks when that day comes, which remember could be in a few months or in 2024, hell it could even be in 2026 for all I know. Right now my portfolio is about 95% cash. I will breakdown and explain each of these holdings: \n\n25% of portfolio will be in VOO - VOO is the lazy, set it and forget it ETF. It is not only great for long term growth, it also pays a nice dividend yield of 1.77%. \n\n20% of portfolio will be in SCHD - this is another good ETF that is good for growth and has an excellent 3.73%. \n\n10% of portfolio will be in GOOG - It's google, need I say more? \n\n10% of portfolio will be in TSLA - It's Tesla. They are the future. \n\n8% of portfolio will be in METV - This is a Metaverse ETF. \n\n8% of portfolio will be in SOFI - The future of banking. Millenials and Gen Z love this company. \n\n7% of portfolio will be in TQQQ at the start of the rally, and will be swung trade every few days to make a profit. \n\n2% of portfolio will be in CCL - I see Carnival Corporation doing well long term. In fact I almost want to buy and hold some after this recent sell off a few days ago. \n\n10% of portfolio will be in cash to do swing trading.",

This gives GOOGL real world utility and subsequently....from the outside view at least...greater value.\n\n2) Larry Page and Sergey Brin own about 56% of GOOGL, making it an even more scarce asset and theoretically more valuable.\n\nThe only logical reason I can think of is that because Larry and Sergey own over 50% of the voting power, there is little reason to own Class A shares....but that surely cannot mean they are still worth less than shares with no voter rights, can it?\n\nAny wisdom you guys can share on why this might be will be useful, as it's something I've wondered about for a while.",

    "selftext": "Let me explain a particular strategy, and then you can tell me why it's a horrible idea.\n\nOk, so let's say that your theory is that there will be plenty of pain in this market till at least Spring 2023 if not longer. However, you also know that along the way there's going to be plenty of rallies. Basically, you're expecting very choppy waters. Lots of red days, but occasional rallies.\n\nLet's say you're interested in investing in something like AMD, NVDA, ADBE, MSFT or GOOG for example. You'd have no problem buying these stocks at their current 52 week lows, and holding them for 3 or 4 years or even longer.\n\nFor example, you could have bought some AMD today in the very high $62 range.\n\nNow, you could of course just buy the stock, and forget about doing anything with it for the next 18 months. \n\nAnother option though, would be to try to daytrade the stock as much as humanly possible, with one HUGE exception. You don't sell it for a loss.\n\nWhenever you're down in the stock, you convert your mindset to the idea that you're holding for at least 18 months or longer. \n\nNow, why would anybody want do something like this? Well, it's back to the choppy waters idea. You believe the SPY will fluctuate from as low as 335 to as high as 405 over the next five or six months. Which means your AMD investment could dive to $48 per share, or pop to $78 per share. Just as possible examples.\n\nHowever, your strategy would be to simply try to squeeze out very small victories on an intraday basis. \n\nI did this exact strategy today with AMD. I made a quick $500.\n\nNow, making a quick $500 is nice, but I put a HUGE amount of money at risk to do it. I could have been stuck as a bagholder of AMD, for who knows how long. Now, luckily, I'm super bullish on AMD, and would have no problem bagholding at these levels in a worst-case scenario.\n\nAlthough, I must admit that if my strategy was to buy AMD and hold for five years, I'd probably wait for the stock to fall to $55 or $53 or something before jumping in. Yes, I believe the stock will trade in this range in the not-too-distant future.\n\nAlso, a huge part of this strategy is not being greedy. When you are doing your daytrading strategy with whatever stock it is, you're just trying to bag a half a percent. Sometimes maybe even a quarter percent. So, for this to really be that big of a deal, you'd have to use some serious capital.\n\nThe downside, is that the market tanks really bad, and you're a bagholder that thought they got in at an awesome entry. Only to realize a few days later that there was nothing special about that entry and you're now underwater.",

    "title": "Opening Discussion About RDDT",
    "selftext": "Hi everyone, I wanted to open up some discussion on RDDT stock. I think a lot of people are investing for the wrong reasons, have it wrong, or are misguided about the company. I do have stock in RDDT so please take what I say with a grain of salt, but I will try to be fair. Also, I am not saying that I am all knowing. If anything, I hope for some good discussion and to be proven wrong.\n\n\n1. Data Licensing\n\nFirst of all, I believe the average retail investor is blowing out of proportion the impact of Data Licensing for RDDT. It obviously is good to have and is an investment positive in and of itself, but people overstate the revenue impact. In terms of last quarter, data licensing revenue was about 7% of overall revenue. This is obviously not an insignificant number, but the advertising revenue grew 81% YoY compared to data licensing\u2019s 24% growth rate.\n\nThis means that data licensing is becoming an even smaller portion of revenue over time, even though it is increasing on a nominal basis. Another thing about data licensing revenue is that RDDT said they had already entered a lot of large value contracts, and that the following ones would be economically smaller but more numerous in terms of the amount of contracts. They have a contract renewal with GOOG which is obviously great, but it is unlikely going to be anything that dramatically moves the needle. A positive about Data Licensing though is that it is pretty much straight profitability. Also, even though it might not be too huge of a revenue impact, it shows that RDDT will be cemented in the future age of AI and LLMs since you need the authentic human interaction.\n\n\n2. Advertising\n\nThis is where I am extremely bullish on RDDT. The unique user base, the highly relevant content and discussion, the targeted ads, the fact that RDDT users are more likely to go on this platform for product choices and purchase recommendations all contribute into what could be a booming advertising platform. There are a few caveats and things to consider, however. I want to start off with what could be a negative.\n\nUser growth is slowing. RDDT no longer has the new IPO hype wave and wave of news flowing around it, which could have caused a lot more user attention and growth. Daily Active Users in the US fell this past quarter and they have historically had an issue of converting passive logged-out users to active and intent logged-in users. This is something to watch out for. RDDT in the last earnings call Q&A stated that there were some hiccups with organic traffic from Google Search, and user growth increased by the end of the quarter, but still watch out.\n\nThis post is actually getting long as hell, so I don\u2019t want to go on too much longer, but I\u2019ll finish off with where I\u2019m most excited. The opportunity to increase the average revenue per user is immense. New product and dynamic ads, optimizing ad inventory, new ad types, and more are coming. Look into ARPU measures and that\u2019s what you can be excited about for RDDT. You don\u2019t even need user growth for RDDT to be able to increase revenue by multiples (partially joking but it is crazy how much monetization potential there is.) Obviously they will never be Meta, but as the platform gains strength they have a lot to gain.\n\nI am happy to include more based on everybody\u2019s reception, but I hope these points can start off a discussion about the future of the stock.\n\n\n",

    "selftext": "Hello everyone. \n\nIve been investing in stocks since 2021, always had little idea what I\u2019m doing but with this incredible bull run lately & with more hands on research & thinking from myself I\u2019ve started to make some very good gains. \n\nThe issue is, I\u2019ve never had much of a strategy, I\u2019ve just bought arbitrary amounts of certain companies if I thought they were going to do well. \n\nRecently I\u2019ve decided that I should employ a strategy whereby I have 85% of my portfolio in \u201ccore\u201d growth stocks that are relatively safe. \n\nThings like: GOOG, ASML, UNH. \n\nAnd another 15% in \u201cmoonshots\u201d like ACHR, NBIS or MSTR. \n\nThe issue is, not counting pies, I currently have 33 individual holdings and I would ideally like to get these down to 12 max. \n\nI struggle knowing, however, when to sell. I\u2019m up a good amount on some stocks but I feel like there could be more growth there. \n\nAt the same time, it\u2019s becoming almost impossible to manage 33 stocks at once effectively. \n\nHow can I remain cold & calculated? Should I just sell all my smaller positions now, take the money & focus on my new strategy?",

    "selftext": "Hello!\n\nMy background for quick orientation: \n\n- EU located, (so Roth IRA, 401k etc. Are not applicable for me. I am maxing out the retirement options available in my country though)\n- no mortgage or other debts to worry about\n- long Horizon (30+ years until retirement)\n\nLast November I inherited decent amount of money that I decided to put into stock market for investing. Ever since, I DCA'd every month, so far 100% into individual stocks, all in US market. It got shaky in April, but after recovery I'm well ahead - I had some misses (BRK.B) but also picked many winners of this year so far - AVGO, ORCL, GOOG etc.\n\nI know, I know, picked top tech stocks in AI craze time in a bullish market and got returns, hardly a difficult achievement. I read a lot of threads here, and recurring wisdom is that beating the market once doesn't mean I will manage to do so every year. Which is why I started thinking about moving some of my assets into ETF's and maybe other more stable instruments so my portfolio is no longer 100% individual stocks.\n\nAnd now here comes the question I would love to get an advice from more experienced investors - what's the best strategy in my position?\n\nA) keep the winners, let them run wild, cut the losses, sell my misses and move those funds into ETF's?\n\nB) vice versa - realize the gains, move them to ETF's, keep dca'ing losses until they go back into green?\n\nC) Just move all of it, winners or losers?\n\nD) Leave all of them alone, and dca into ETF'S from now on instead?\n\nE) None of the above?\n\nAll suggestions would be much appreciated.",

Its core search business is going to be disrupted by AI but it is still entrenched and they have the time and resources to adapt. Meanwhile they own the largest streaming platform in YouTube, and arguably the most actually successful robotaxi business in Waymo. If they were ever split up the parts would be worth far more than the sum.\n\nAAPL's heyday is behind it since their growth is anchored in devices and they will probably never acquire significantly more market share in phones meanwhile they have to create a new Fortune 500 sized business every year just to try to keep the growth going.\n\nAMZN on the other hand is not bound by any particular industry or market. They are getting into satellites, pharmaceutical delivery, health care, and can pick any large market they want to address.\n\nMSFT's new leadership after the atrocious Ballmer has brought the company into huge new markets and they are well positioned to capitalize on AI, with a PE of 39 they are not cheap but by far not the most expensive with solid growth prospects.\n\nI personally think that social media is a scourge upon the earth and is destroying the minds of young and old people alike, but META has essentially monopolies that will not be disrupted. \n\nMeanwhile these companies are investing nearly $300 billion in cap ex per year and have returned nearly $1 trillion to shareholders in buybacks and dividends over the past 5 years. These aren't unprofitable \"dot com bubble\" stocks but entrenched cash cows.",

It really impacted companies like MSFT and NVDA which at the time was the right call to call that bluff.\n\nBut now, with GOOG coming out declaring it wants to spend upwards of 75% of its net income on CAPEX. Is it too much going forward?\n\nGOOG's CAPEX has increased from a 49% average pre 2016, to a current average of 54.2% of its net income. But now it wants to spend nearly 75% for estimated 2025 Net income. And says it'll increase even more in 2026.\n\nA bigger concern is that all this infrastructure has a high attrition rate.

    "selftext": "Price before earnings represents the dealer hedge against the bet. Because people are betting on a price drop, say from $168 to $150. The dealer instead has to raise the price to $186, otherwise there's a free \"arbitrage\" to earn \"free money\". (A bet that the move is $18 == a hedge of $18 favoring the dealer so they take the spread at the trade and are neutral to the price).\n\nSo while not always true, especially in legitimately unexpected earnings results; when price rises into earnings, big money is betting against the earnings.\n\nWhen price falls into earnings, big money is betting for the earnings.\n\nIt's very simple sports-betting type stuff.\n\nIf you look at GOOGs own earnings history you can see that about 75% of the time the Earnings marked a top where price rose, or a bottom where price fell into earnings. So just there you see a roughly 75% chance that GOOG's price falls after earnings over the next quarter.\n\nPS - as the first commenter points out. It does not necessarily mean \"sell everything chicken little\". But if you want to play earnings it's probably better to wait and DCA if the price goes down on your favored stocks. Rather than try to play a rally that you won't sell anyway because \\*YOU\\* are probably a typical investor who buys and holds.\n\nIn the case of GOOG, I'd wait and see regardless. I don't see a point in buying it at this price. And I think weak tech earnings will signal an earnings recession anyway. Which will terrify the markets given EVERYTHING else we have going on.",

Well he wrote this book a year ago, before people knew wtf quantum was... and basically got the readers hyped about quantum but says like 100 times in the book that we won't see this stuff happen until 2050.

TLDR: the best quantum companies are GOOG and IBM. Both are too large to see any financial impact from quantum on the stock. However, these two stocks have the balance sheet to support massive/costly R&D in quantum that these smaller \"quantum\" companies don't have. He makes the interesting point that these companies went public (IONQ, Rigetti, D Wave, etc) because they are running out of money and need to raise money and dilute shareholders to stay afloat. IF they were that good, they would have been scooped up by IBM and GOOG already. He also notes the best quantum companies (outside of GOOG and IBM) are still private, so average people like you and I can't invest in them anyways. Basically the shitty quantum companies are the ones that are public right now.\n\n\u00a0\n\n**And most importantly, the computers don't work well. IONQ and RGTI computers are actually down right now.** [https://x.com/MartinShkreli/status/1879607624569872443](https://x.com/MartinShkreli/status/1879607624569872443) & [https://x.com/MartinShkreli/status/1879896705434591582](https://x.com/MartinShkreli/status/1879896705434591582)\n\nThese computers aren't even online right now for IONQ and RGTI.\n\n\u00a0\n\nBasically this all seems like an emotional yolo into quantum. Most people don't understand it and the commerical applications are years and years, probably decades away. I would invest with caution as this has bubble written all over it , imo. Yes, I am short right now. ",

    "title": "Tax implications question regarding capitol losses/gains",
    "selftext": "My RSUs and ESPP shares will be forced to sell as my company is being acquired by another (new company is not public). The price it is being sold at will leave me with an overall capitol loss of \\~20K (most long-term with some short-term shares being sold). Since this is going to happen, I'm thinking of also selling most of my other shares in which I have made long-term capitol gains (NVDA +10K, GOOG +1K, AMZN +1K, etc) and then buying all these shares back since I would like to hold onto them longer. Therefore the \\~20K in losses that I'm forced to take is somewhat \"offset\" by selling shares I've earned gains from, wiping out my capitol gains tax and having a better tax situation. Then buy back the shares I've sold from NVDA, GOOG, AMZN, etc, and I no longer have to worry about a bigger tax bill on the capitol gains when I finally do decide to sell.\n\nI don't know much about the taxing on capitol losses/gains and buying back stocks you've recently sold for a profit. So am I missing something here, is it as simple as I have stated to avoid a much higher tax bill in the future by doing this or am I way off? Also, selling shares for a profit and then buying them back the next day to lower the taxes I would pay on capitol gains tax is allowed? Or is there some rule/law that says you can't do that? Sorry for the basic questions, but this is new to me. Thanks for any help, much appreciated!",

    "title": "Analyzing the Analysts: Using average analyst price target to identify possible buying opportunities amongst the top 100 companies in the S&P",
    "selftext": "Hello everyone,\n\nI'm a lazy investor and don't like to do much due diligence, but I do like to make money. Unfortunately these two things about me are often at odds as I've lost money in the past for not doing my DD. As such, I continue to be lazy but I try and find ways to work around doing due diligence and hopefully finding loop holes.\n\nOne such way that I have been thinking about recently is using analyst ratings, reviews and price targets as a surrogate for due diligence. In essence, I try to just have these analysts do the work for me. An idea I had is that much in the same way that with those who believe in technical analysis hold that everything you need to know about a stock is baked into it's price action, and so when something good happens the stock price goes up and when something bad happens the stock price goes down, thus all you need is to analyze trends in stock price and you'll be analyzing everything about the stock by proxy, I have a thesis (or theory) that perhaps you can do the same or something similar with analyst price targets of companies.\n\nNow I know that anyone who has read this far, already thinks I'm an idiot. Many experienced individual investors probably find market analysts to be stupid and therefor I'm stupid for following their lead, but I would argue to the contrary for a few reasons. As much as I have put in a lot of effort to learn about how the market operates (been investing for the last 6 years, started learning actively about it as much as I could a couple years prior to that), there is still much I don't know as I don't have a finance or economics degree. Moreover, as bad as you may think an analyst is, they are at least competent enough to keep their job as an analyst at the investment firm that allows them to make stock price target selections. Lastly, and most importantly, what I am about to discuss below uses the aggregate of several analyst price targets so I'm not relying on a single analyst but several (probably between 10 and 40 per company). I think if two-dozen analysts are strongly in favor of a company, it is unlikely that my novice investor wisdom would have researched the company and found a flaw that they all missed.\n\nSo what I did yesterday evening was go through the top 100 S&P 500 companies by market cap and find the current average price target for them on Yahoo Finance. I then divided the current stock price (at the close on 7/31) by that price target and expressed it as a percentage to see how far off the company was from the average price target analysts were aiming for. Then I also listed how many total ratings each company had, and how many of them were 'Strong Buys' and 'Buys'.\n\nThis yielded the following table:\n\n|+|A|B|C|D|E|F|G|H|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|1|Company|Current Price|Price Target|Percent to Target|Total Ratings|# Strong Buy Ratings|# Buy Ratings|% of Ratings that were Strong

This lead me to the following 11 companies:\nMicron Technologies (MU), Boston Scientific (BSX), Abbot Laboratories (ABT), Merck Scientific (MRK), Stryker (SYK), The Cigna Group (CI), Broadcom (AVGO), Comcast (CMCSA), Honeywell International (HON), Analogue Devices (ADI), and Intuit Inc. (INTU)\n\nI have about $5,000 I'd like to invest right now and I have half a mind to just put it equally weighted into these 11 companies and just watch it for the next year or two. I'll either do that or put it all in VOO, but I have a feeling that these 11 companies might beat the S&P 500 over the next 24 months.\n\nWhat do you guys think?",

    "selftext": "Update: After reading some articles and examples Daily ETP have Stop-Loss in them unfortunately... This means that long ETP would trigger a SL if the underlying stock drops \\~16.6% in a single day. So that's how the ETP originators earn money.  \n\nHello Everyone,\n\nWhy are retail traders not completely ignoring CFD trades and going all in on low priced leveraged ETPs (pennies)?\n\nExample is GraniteShares 3x Long AMD Daily ETC (3LAM.L) currently just 2.74$\n\nWe all know that chances are AMD will be more valuable in a year compared to now, as the AI hype wouldn't die in a year. There is too much market share to be taken away from Nvidia and the market doesn't even have too - the demand is currently way higher than the supply, so it's only a plus! The issue with futures and CFDs are that you pay fees, have stop loss and need to know very precisely how much and in which direction the market will move between the opening and closing of your position. With ETP you don't care, as you don't have daily fees or stop loss and inflation is your friend, as generally more money will be put into the profitable stocks sooner or later due to rising expenses and thus prices.\n\nThis ETP has made 20.1% in a day while AMD 5.25%\n\nThe NVDA equivalent has made from 6$ to 150$ in just a year. Using x5 leverage maybe could provide that return, but at a MASSIVE risk. How likely was it to lose money from NVDA 1 year ago by buying this ETP at just 6$? Similar ETPs for the other tech companies are already trading at far higher ranges than just 2-3$.\n\nFor some reason this Google ETP 3LAL hasn't reach it's ATH although currently GOOG is trading around ATH. I guess it has to do with when the ETP starts trading on the market or maybe it doesn't monitor stock splits/dillutions.\n\nI am wondering who is on the other sides of those ETP trades? You cannot convince me that people are shorting 3LAM while it's at a silly 2.74$ (was around 0.3$ when AMD was 80$) and AMD just recently started it's AI hyped bull run. Sure it already made around 300% in a year, but so did NVDA and AMD started from way lower market cap! I was actually shorting NVDA around 500-600$ range, as I didn't do any due diligence on it's main product behind everything :( - the Tensor A100 and how many orders were for it etc.\n\nPlease try to give me arguments why 3LAM would be a bad investment to buy and hold for 1 year if AMD - besides AMD getting priced less than 202$ per share? The fees is around 0.3% per trade without any daily fees from what I could tell.\n\nAnother example is 3LVW if you think Volkswagen will recover (I do) :). It has massive debt, but pays 8% in dividends.\n\nDisclaimer - I put have put my money where my mouth is, but I stay open to corrections about my understandings, as I have been proven very wrong recently about AMZN and why it's valued this high.\n\nWhy is math not working in some cases? Microstrategy did around x10 increase in a single year. The ETP did around 10 000 times increase?!\n\n3LMI went from 0.01$ to 337.71$ - it seems like the starting price is the biggest factor, as this is not just x30 times increase (due to the x3 leverage), but an insane 3 377 000% - good luck for any crypto to beat that!\n\nI couldn't find a single ETP in GraniteShares portfolio of products that achieved the opposite - starting from 1-10$ range and going down to 0.00001$ etc.",

This is used to determine the Call or Put Premium associated with the pricing of options (implied volatility).\n    \n- **Directional Bias:** Ranges from -100 (bearish) to +100 (bullish) and accounts for RSI, price trend, moving averages, and put/call skew over the past 6 weeks.\n\n- **Priced Move:** given the current option prices, how much in dollar amounts will the underlying have to move to make the call/put break even. This is how much vol the option is pricing in. The expected move.\n\n- **Expiration:** 2023-09-01.\n\n- **Call/Put Premium:** How much extra you are paying for the implied move relative to the historic move. Low numbers mean options are \"cheaper.\" High numbers mean options are \"expensive.\"\n\n- **Efficiency:** This factor represents the bid/ask spreads and the depth of the order book relative to the price of the option. It represents how much traders will pay in slippage with a round trip trade. Lower numbers are less efficient than higher numbers.\n\n- **E.R.:** Days unitl the next Earnings Release. This feature is still in beta as we work on a more complete list of earnings dates.\n\n- **Why isn't my stock on this list?** It doesn't have \"weeklies\", the underlying is \"too cheap\", or the options markets are too illiquid (open interest) to qualify for this strategy. 480 underlyings are used in this report and only the top results end up passing the criteria for each filter.",

    "selftext": "So background: I have an individual account with \\~$37,000.00 in it. I \\~usually\\~ only keep about $1,000.00 cash in the account, waiting for my next stock/etf to invest in. Due to having a relatively good year, i've trimmed some of my individual stocks. Basically just taking profits of a few companies that have really appreciated this year (UBER, AMZN, GOOG). \n\nSo now, i'm sitting about $6,000 cash. The current holdings im in (SPY, SCHW, USB, ALTO, UBER, PINS, ISCG) all have had a really good run the last few months relative to my entry point (amongst many things in the market, of course). Meaning that they are at least AT the % of holding that i am comfortable with holding (AKA, don't want to add anymore to these holdings). \n\nI really haven't had the time to dive into companies and even if i did, i probably will wait til earnings season is over until i put more into other individual stocks. But on the flip side, i really don't want to sit on 15%+ cash lol. \n\nHas anyone else been in this scenario? I'd like to throw like $5,000.00 into something (maybe like a JPST/JEPI type) until i feel good enough to throw some of this cash into more \"riskier\" assets (stocks)? \n\n&#x200B;",

    "selftext": "On July 7 [Nasdaq announced](https://www.nasdaq.com/press-release/the-nasdaq-100-index-special-rebalance-to-be-effective-july-24-2023-2023-07-07) its third-ever 'special rebalance' of the Nasdaq 100 index, which will take effect July 24, 2023.\n\nAs a result of the rebalance, you should expect Nasdaq to [significantly decrease the weight of the largest stocks](https://www.tastylive.com/news-insights/everything-you-need-to-know-about-what-will-happen-to-the-nasdaq-after-the-special-rebalance) ($MSFT, $AAPL, $GOOGL/$GOOG, $NVDA, and $AMZN) from a total of 43+% to below a 38.5% maximum. TSLA may also see a small downward weighting. Smaller stocks should see a small increase in the weight.\n\nETFs/mutual funds that try to follow the Nasdaq 100 (such as $QQQ) will need to adjust their holdings accordingly. So you should expect them to sell the largest stocks and buy the smaller ones -- perhaps they already have -- and that will affect the prices of those stocks accordingly.\n\nIt also means that those ETFs/mutual funds will not accurately reflect the relative weight of the largest stocks. So if you wish to be weighted according to actual market cap, you would need to supplement those holdings.\n\nNormally the index rebalances every quarter. But the largest stocks are dominating the index and funds that follow the index need to maintain compliance with a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rule on fund diversification. On July 3, the largest six stocks saw their combined weight reach 50.9% of the index.\n\nRead more in this [Reuters \"Explainer\"](https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/what-is-nasdaqs-special-rebalancing-its-impact-2023-07-11/) or [Bloomberg article](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-10/big-tech-s-dominance-in-stock-market-hits-breaking-point-for-nasdaq-100) (paywall) or Matt Levine's [Money Stuff newsletter](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2023-07-11/matt-levine-s-money-stuff-elon-musk-blames-the-lawyers) (paywall/signup)",

    "selftext": "I'm developing an application related to ETF portfolios (the goal is to be able to analyze intersection, diversification between countries, categories, portfolio trend \\[small to large, value to growth map\\], etc).\n\nAnyway. An ETF that I really like is **AVGE**, from Avantis. If I could summarize it in a few words, it would be the \"VT with tendency to the value factor\". It is a \"fund of funds\" with the following composition:\n\n* Avantis U.S. Equity ETF (42.78%)\n* Avantis U.S. Large Cap Value ETF (15.05%)\n* Avantis International Equity ETF (10.89%)\n* Avantis Emerging Markets Equity ETF (6.37%)\n* Avantis International Large Cap Value ETF (5.49%)\n* Avantis U.S. Small Cap Value ETF (4.95%)\n* Avantis U.S Small Cap Equity ETF (4.86%)\n* Avantis Emerging Markets Value ETF (4.28%)\n* Avantis Real Estate ETF (3.00%)\n* Avantis International Small Cap Value ETF (2.17%)\n* State Street Institutional Investment Trust US Government Money Market Fund Institutional (0.09%)\n\nI got this information from the website [etf.com/avge](https://etf.com/avge). But I would like to go further. I would not like to see the funds that make up these funds, I want to see the holdings that make up the funds of that fund.\n\nSo, with a little bit of programming I was able to extract this information and publish it in this github repository. There are two CSV, of which:\n\n* [avge-holdings-ungrouped.csv](https://github.com/victornoleto/avge-holdings/blob/master/avge-holdings-ungrouped.csv): In this CSV I have not grouped the repeated companies. You will be able to see the weight of each holding in each of the funds. Example: APPL represents 4.78% of AVUS (which represents 42.78% of AVGE) and at the same time represents 2.98% of AVLV (which represents 15.05% of AVGE).\n* [avge-holdings-grouped.csv](https://github.com/victornoleto/avge-holdings/blob/master/avge-holdings-grouped.csv): This CSV shows the actual participation of a given company in AVGE. So, for example, the APPL that is part of AVUS and AVLG, its real weight is 2.49% (4.78%\\*42.78% + 2.98%\\*15.05%).\n\nAnd, just to make the post more graphic, I end with the list of the 10 biggest AVGE positions.\n\n|Name|Ticker|Weight|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Apple Inc.|AAPL|2.49%|\n|Microsoft Corporation|MSFT|1.56%|\n|Exxon Mobil Corporation|XOM|0.92%|\n|Meta Platforms Inc. Class A|META|0.85%|\n|JPMorgan Chase & Co|JPM|0.80%|\n|Chevron Corporation|CVX|0.77%|\n|Merck & Co., Inc|MRK|0.76%|\n|Alphabet Inc. Class A|GOOGL|0.63%|\n|Pfizer Inc|PFE|0.56%|\n|Alphabet Inc. Class C|GOOG|0.55%|\n\nThe fund's 10 largest positions add up to **9.91%**. It's a pretty small value when compared to growth ETFs like QQQ, VUG, etc.\n\n# Next goals (which I will do when I have time):\n\n* Compare the percentage portfolio between AVGE and VT;\n* Get the country and sector of each of the 9824 holdings. In this way I will be able to carry out a study of the geographic and sectorial diversification of AVGE. I'll probably use ChatGPT to help me with this because I haven't found any api that can give me this information easily.",

    "title": "The most crucial topic this week will involve corporate reports. Who are the leaders, and who are the laggards?",
    "selftext": "Below, I'm offering up the sectors  that I believe have the greatest potential for improved financial  performance, as well as those that may disappoint investors.\n\nI expect an increase in financial performance in the following areas:\n\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 Technology: Primarily, companies specializing in AI and hardware production.\n\n\u25aa **Nvidia (NVDA)** graphics cards remain highly popular among users, while **Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)** and **Intel (INTC)** may also signal a recovery in demand. AI product creators **Alphabet (GOOG)** and **Microsoft (MSFT)** could also see increased demand for their products in the coming quarters, boosting profits.\n\n2\ufe0f\u20e3  Cryptocurrency companies: Rising prices for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and  other coins are likely to boost profits from commissions for the **Coinbase** crypto exchange **(COIN)** and from the mining company **Marathon Digital (MARA)**.\n\n3\ufe0f\u20e3 Energy and precious metals mining:\n\n\u25aa Mineral prices (gold and silver) exhibited a growth trend in the reporting quarter. This could send profits for **Newmont (NEM)** and **Barrick Gold (GOLD)** soaring.\n\n\u25aa Increasing energy demand could result in higher revenues for **Peabody Energy (BTU)** and **Arch Resources (ARCH)**.\n\nLaggards:\n\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 Financial: Tightening credit conditions and deposit outflows are likely to primarily impact regional banks such as **First Republic Bank (FRC)**. Large banks, including those with investment banking divisions like **Bank of America (BAC)** and **JP Morgan (JPM)**,  could benefit from deposit inflows and increased asset values in the  stock market. However, the quality of their loan portfolios is  deteriorating, and reserves are growing.\n\nI'm not ready to add these shares to my portfolios, so I will continue to observe the dynamics of these stocks.\n\nAdditionally, the reports from **Wells Fargo (WFC)**, JP Morgan Chase, and **Citigroup (C)** showed decent results thanks to cost control and growth in net interest income.\n\n2\ufe0f\u20e3  Consumer: Stores, including online marketplaces, typically experience a  decline in demand in the 1st quarter following holiday sales. I  anticipate a drop in demand indicators from **Best Buy (BBY)**, **Walmart (WMT)**, **GAP (GPS)**, as well as **Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY)**, which faces bankruptcy.\n\n3\ufe0f\u20e3  Healthcare: The coronavirus pandemic and seasonal colds have subsided,  and the increased demand for drugs has dwindled. Medical companies such  as **Teva (TEVA)**, **Pfizer (PFE)**, and **Novavax (NVAX)** could increase spending on new drugs, which would impact shareholder returns negatively.\n\nConclusion:\n\nAdding  a sector to one list or another doesn't necessarily mean that after the  report is presented, all of the stocks in promising sectors will soar  while all of those in the laggard category will tank. Rather, these are  thoughts on on the medium- and long-term growth prospects of specific  sectors in my field of vision.",

After taxes + Insurance + ESPP cuts, I am left up with around 5k and my expenses are 4k-4.5k/month (rent itself is 2.2k) so there will be leftovers for $500 to 1k USD every month.\n\nI just started putting $500 in my elder ones UTMA account and thinking of buying Dividend stocks e.g. JEPI / BST / SCHD etc but I am open to suggestions and If I shouldn't invest that amount at all as tenure is short. I also have 529s which are not mentioned below, they also have 1k each for both of them but they are not growing at all so I am not sure if it's wise to put $ in them now.\n\nI've saved the following so far for them:\n\n# Kid1 (14 yo, 8th grader): \n\nGraduate UTMA Account: Invested $7056 and current value is $5156  \n\n\n|  **Symbol**|**Quantity**|Buying price|Cost|Current|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|GOOGL|0.274|114.49|31|26|\n|GOOG   |31.9835|140.08|4480|3078|\n|Netflix   |1.117|358.38|400|314|\n|NVDA|0.635|148.36|95|101|\n|INTEL|8.0715|37.28|300|232|\n|Robinhood|10|13.77|138|91|\n|Shopify|10|69.42|695|380|\n|Disney|0.2029|112.03|22|20|\n|SPY ETF|1|384|384|396|\n|Cash|||500|500|\n|**TOTAL**|||**7056**|**5156**|\n\nPost Graduate UTMA Account: Invested $1133 and current value is $785  \n\n\n|  **Symbol**|**Quantity**|Buying price|Cost|Current|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|GOOGL|2.13|110.78|236|205|\n|GOOG|6.872|148.68|1022|661|\n|AAPL|0.1236|156.88|19|18|\n|Intel|8.829|37.33|329|254|\n|Zillow|7|115.31|807|243|\n|**TOTAL**|||**2413**|**1381**|\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Kid2 (8 yo, 2nd grader): \n\nGraduate UTMA Account: Invested $3383 and current value is $2475  \n\n\n|  **Symbol**|**Quantity**|Buying price|Cost|Current|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|GOOGL|**8.514**|**123.28**|**1049**|**820**|\n|GOOG   |10.6315|142.38|1513|1027|\n|AAPL   |0.1584|164.9|26|22.97|\n|EMIR   |0.0018|94.44|0.17|0.17|\n|INTEL|17.1343|37.17|636|494|\n| META   |1|156.59|156|109|\n|TGT   |0.0001|300|0.03|0.02|\n|WBA|0.0069|49.28|0.34|0.28|\n|**TOTAL**|||**3383**|**2475**|\n\nPost Graduate UTMA Account: Invested $2413 and current value is $1380  \n\n\n|  **Symbol**|**Quantity**|Buying price|Cost|Current|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|GOOGL|2.13|110.78|235|204|\n|GOOG   |6.872|148.68|1021|661|\n|AAPL   |0.1236|156.88|20|18|\n|INTEL|8.829|37.33|329|253|\n| Zillow|7|115.31|807|243|\n|**TOTAL**|||**2413**|**1380**|\n\n\\*\\*Mods please advice if I should add/remove anything that's not correct, else let it be there I wanna hear back from fam please.",

Stock was down by -3.61%",
