    "selftext": "Nobody on here is really talking about Applied Digital (APLD) and I think it has serious potential. The stock is sitting around 19.50 right now and it has already run over 70 percent in the last three months. What makes it interesting is not just the chart but the actual business story.\n\nAPLD is building out high performance data centers specifically designed for AI workloads. They already signed hosting contracts worth over 11 billion dollars, mostly with CoreWeave, which is one of the fastest growing names in the AI compute space. These are not small speculative deals either. They are long term leases that give APLD revenue visibility for years.\n\nThe company has about 200 megawatts of capacity now and plans to reach 400 to 500 megawatts by 2026. Each 100 megawatts can generate around 300 to 400 million in annual revenue. Analysts are projecting revenue to grow from about 450 million in fiscal 2024 to over 1.2 billion by fiscal 2026. That type of growth would support a market cap in the 3 to 4 billion range compared to about 2 billion today.\n\nIf AI demand stays hot and they continue hitting build out milestones, I think a reasonable short term price target is 25 to 27 by the end of this year. If momentum really catches on and retail wakes up to this play, I could see it testing 30. The risk is execution and concentration with a few clients, but the math lines up.\n\nRight now everyone is watching NVDA and the mega caps but APLD is a pure play AI infrastructure stock that is still under the radar. I am betting it is going to get a lot more attention soon.\n",

    "title": "$GLXY $CRWV- A massive deal for StarGate between CoreWeave, Galaxy and a Hyperscaler - Additional New 2.7 GigaWatts of Power Unaccounted For",
    "selftext": "StarGate is here and one does not just bring on GigaWatts of power to a building without massive expertise, knowhow, land rights and government help for expediency on permitting. I have no idea on the timing of this but the tea leaves are all right in front of us.\n\n**TL;DR:** I believe a massive new deal is brewing for Giga-Scale AI Factory capacity between CoreWeave, Galaxy, and an AI HyperScaler. New Government regulations are lightspeeding the permitting process and allowing companies to start building while air permits are being obtained. This should lead to new massive deals sooner in the near term rather than later. Even if the projects are years out. Giga-Scale powered AI Factories are here and the opportunity has never been better for companies like Galaxy. The providers (OpenAI, MSFT, Google, AWS) don't want to be landlords or data center builders and the data center builders don't want to be landlords-This is where Galaxy fits in.\n\nFirst, who the hell is Galaxy and why are they important? Turns out, they are an up and coming Crypto (we have lots of space and power) to AI infrastructure play based out of Alfont, Texas.\n\nSpecifically, Helios is the is the campus where they have initial power and upcoming powered AI shells and newly closed land deals and power requests that are reportedly bringing **an additional 2.7 Gigawatts of fully functional powered AI GPU data center shells**.\n\nTo note, Oracle just closed a $300 Billion deal with OpenAI that is tied to StarGate and the quick notes on that are\n\n* 4.5 GigaWatts of power\n* Scheduled for first delivery by 2027\\*\n* $300 Billion contract over 5 years\n\nAgain, nobody just has GigaWatts of power on the US grid. It is rare earth mineral levels of concern right now. There is so much work and permitting on that amount of power scale that the government had to issue new executive orders to try and help expedite the process.\n\nFor Oracle they have about \\~$10 Billion in cash and they are [reportedly (Bloomberg) preparing a $38 Billion debt package from various banks](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-04/banks-ready-38-billion-of-debt-for-data-centers-tied-to-oracle). Roughly to get 4.5 GigaWatts of power is going to cost you about $38+($32B - $60B) Billion and yield you $300 Billion over 5 years... Not bad. And it gives us a baseline of how to think about this. **\\*Note this figure does not include Nvidia GPUS.** That's extra.\n\nFor Galaxy, they are already starting this process of bringing on massive new power for land acquisitions now giving them over 1500 sq acres of land in Texas with clearly the ability to add on more throughout the years even over the current amount. Literally, this is big new oil in the making right there in big ole Texas.\n\nHere's the kicker, CoreWeave has been buying all (100%) of their announced and soon to be ready power for their initial phases I,II,III of totalled 800 MW of active compute power.\n\nJust take a look of all the deals and power CoreWeave has committed to and it's not just partial. It's ALL OF IT.\n\n**CoreWeave & Galaxy / Helios Phases & Timing**\n\n* **Phase I**\n   * **Critical IT:** 133 MW | **Gross power:** \\~200 MW\n   * **Contract:** 15-yr lease signed **Mar 28, 2025**\n   * **Delivery window:** **1H 2026**\n   * **Sources:** Galaxy FY24/Q1\u201925 PR; Q2\u201925 call transcript.

[Galaxy Digital](https://investor.galaxy.com/news/news-details/2025/Galaxy-Closes-1-4-Billion-Project-Financing-Facility-to-Accelerate-Helios-AI-Datacenter-Development/default.aspx)\n4. **New land + 1 GW interconnect request:** In the **Q2\u201925 earnings call**, Galaxy said it entered a **PSA for 160 acres** and submitted a **1 GW load interconnection request** adjacent to Helios (this 1 GW is part of the broader \u201cunder study\u201d pool).

They recently closed on land adjacent to Helios in 2024 of 160 acres and very recently an agreement mentioned in their Q2 earnings call alluded to another 160 acres is now a done deal. So from their Q2 we have an agreement to the now signed and recorded deed this is a very real acquisition and commitment for Galaxy. Especially, the 1 GW power interconnect request that came with the property.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y505m06zejof1.png?width=2305&format=png&auto=webp&s=bb8458d05d64a8369fd23786ab928b606ac02c26\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dk4gtg6zejof1.png?width=2317&format=png&auto=webp&s=b2bb232f8e1fd2f61dbbc0319c786c7b23ba50d3\n\nBoth of these deeds are from 2025 and are for the plots below in the large red square with green circles 33, 39 and I believe 37 give a total of another 160 acres. Everything that is highlighted or squared below is what Galaxy owns. The current Helios setup and committed 800 MW of active power is in the yellow square.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c14simu1fjof1.png?width=1248&format=png&auto=webp&s=ae1daeb6417548f90ef3474d5c99f17c95171cce\n\nEven the neighboring plots are just a bunch of old people selling farmland. So the question becomes. Who is Galaxy building all of that active powered AI ready shells for? Again, at every turn CoreWeave has been the one to buy up the leases at a 15 year commit.\n\nNow, if you remember there are additional tea leaves to follow here too. In the Q2 call Michael and team alluded to another extension that would be realized in Q3. We haven't heard about that as of yet. That is still a major Q3 catalyst we are all waiting for.\n\nWhat we also know is that yesterday at the Goldman Sachs conference call the CoreWeave team was asked a question, \"are there or do you see any more multi-billion dollar deals being done?\" How CoreWeave replied was telling, they neither confirmed nor denied but what they did say is this.\n\n* What they are seeing now is an inflection point in demand.\n* Customers are coming to them for longer contracts (extended time periods)\n* And customers are requesting the very highest end GPU's which are currently the GB Ultra 300's NVL72 racks.\n* **We talked to insiders and even the NBIS deal as large as it is still doesn't fix the problem - They need still need more**\n* **There is an insatiable demand for AI**\n\nTo me, what this is all saying is that reasoning models are burning through GPU's. Empirically I know this to be true but the comment from CoreWeave just outright confirms this. And to that point the very next hours of yesterday during Oracle's earnings call they reported a massive 300B data center deal and need.\n\nSo right there, only hours later another major multi-billion dollar deal was being done.\n\nAnd Michael alluded to that whatever the NBIS deal is that still isn't enough. But why? Reasoning models while so much better than before they are slower than hell at returning an answer. Sam Altman literally said, \"we have even way larger and better models but we don't have the capacity (GPU'S) to give them to you.\"\n\nTracking it all, there is still an insatiable demand and obvious capacity constraints.\n\nAgain, what is Galaxy doing buying all this land and land studying 2.7 GigaWatts of additional power for? To me, that has to be some NDA'd customer that is committing to that data center scale. So, why not CoreWeave? They are already a preferred customer and have commited to 800 MW already from Galaxy.\n\nAnd it gets even better.\n\nRemember that the US power grid is so strained right now anyone gaining access to it is basically given contract. Literally, that is the Vineland NJ deal for NBIS and Microsoft. The initial deal from MSFT is you have 200 MW - 300 MW of power coming online, \"We'll take that right now.\" No questions asked.\n\nWhat if at some milestone i.e. permit checkmark or otherwise Galaxy says we are ready to establish Phase 4, 5, 6, 7 to commit/contract out? That I know is going to occur but the only real question I have is how fast can that unbeknownst to me milestone occur to give an official deal channel from CoreWeave with Galaxy and thus CoreWeave to Hyperscaler?\n\nWell, if you remember, President Trump and the EPA now have an official fast track AI infrastructure plan which is to remove hurdles and obstacles to get AI powered shells up and going as fast as possible. That's net new from just a couple months ago.\n\nThe largest benefit that will shave off 18-30 months of a normal project is letting the landlord build first without have any emissions and working in parrell for the other land and water regulations that have to occur whilst trying to fast track those parts and pieces too.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m7wfsck4fjof1.png?width=750&format=png&auto=webp&s=a33d66c4065dc93933a4174a66d95321146b6ee3\n\n**Current Understanding of New EPA Rules**\n\n* **Executive Order is in force.** EO **14318** \u201cAccelerating Federal Permitting of Data Center Infrastructure\u201d was signed **July 23, 2025** and published in the Federal Register **July 28, 2025**. It directs agencies to use FAST-41, NEPA categorical exclusions, and other shortcuts for large (100 MW+) AI data centers and their power infrastructure. [The White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/07/accelerating-federal-permitting-of-data-center-infrastructure/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n* **EPA has announced rulemaking (proposed).** On **Sept 9, 2025**, EPA said it will revise the \u201c**Begin Actual Construction**\u201d definition under Clean Air Act NSR so **non-emitting work can start before air permits are issued**; formal rule text isn\u2019t final yet. [US EPA](https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-announces-permitting-reform-provide-clarity-expedite-construction-essential-power?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n* **FAST-41 dashboard exists but no AI data centers listed yet.** The Permitting Council\u2019s dashboard shows covered/transparency projects; as of today there\u2019s **no clearly labeled AI data center project** posted. (Categories are public, but specific AI DC entries aren\u2019t there yet.) [Performance.gov Permitting Council](https://www.permits.performance.gov/projects/fast-41-covered?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n\nThe update of you can begin construction now before needing the Clean Air Act NSR air permits are needed to begin non-emitting work. That's massive. I believe this could usher in commitments and deal sign-offs a lot sooner.\n\nYou show the hyperscaler you have a powered shell commit and they are ready to contract up; right way. For these reasons I believe we may get a massive new deal in the range of $22 - $50 Billion dollars to assure that whatever capacity Galaxy and CoreWeave yield is committed to throughout a longer 7 - 10 year capacity commitment.\n\nThis is the only thing that makes sense for what Galaxy is doing. Of course I could be wrong or my timeline could be way off so we shall see.\n\nHere is Helios in 2024\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1xnbc7o6fjof1.png?width=1491&format=png&auto=webp&s=0e0cc8822e2da508d1f6f22ff0731f17439bf719\n\nIf this looks crude and unorganized but effective that's because it is. This is mostly the power Galaxy's Helios had up and running for coin mining operations converted now over for the AI new big oil gold rush.\n\nInterestingly Nvidia (NVDA) has released a new blog post on September 9th 2025 giving reference designs for what Giga-Scale AI Factories should look like and as you see the comparison they are nothing what the current Helios design looks like today.\n\n[NVIDIA Partners With AI Infrastructure Ecosystem to Unveil Reference Design for Giga-Scale AI Factories](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/ai-factories-reference-design/)\n\nAt the AI Infrastructure Summit, NVIDIA\u2019s Ian Buck introduces a reference design and partner-driven strategy to transform global infrastructure for high-performance, energy-efficient AI.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/crm4amz8fjof1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=5a727438a89a019d52ad6e012a73f53ec06da4f2\n\nData center Giga-Scale factories are here and Galaxy has a front row seat to massive income and incoming AI capex. Hyperscalers are paying out huge amounts of cash to anyone and everyone who can procure massive amounts of power. Galaxy is actively doing just this.\n\n**My current positions:** I've opened a small position in GLXY and will be adding more Today!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/loxvr7kbfjof1.png?width=1801&format=png&auto=webp&s=1302fe5d76d95546311fe7b791e1fa3c48842b29\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fyfld7kbfjof1.png?width=1735&format=png&auto=webp&s=1b813ff58b8362500eed18a1f6175fca8218295f\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vq3p08kbfjof1.png?width=1729&format=png&auto=webp&s=cb76ca1a082281873078f596d0e5ac0cfac6e17b\n\n",

Despite the fact they raised full year guidance and had +27% year over year revenue growth, the stock still took a 30% haricut. \n\n\n\n[As you can see by the picture, the light green dots are well above the dark green dots and that is a good thing](https://preview.redd.it/uv1mer4m5hmf1.png?width=708&format=png&auto=webp&s=38320cafcea80080f0ae249066e5adf5d71679d3)\n\nI don't believe in technical analysis or colorful lines but since the drop, the stock has been bouncing off resistance at $180 until it broke through on Thursday. On Friday it continued up while the rest of the market and tech sector sold off. Nothing about the core business has changed and I believe the selloff was bigly overdone, so over the course of the next month or two we'll see a move back to the $270 range. Two upcoming catalysts will likely help with that, MNDY speaks at the Goldman Sachs conference Sep 10th, and they're hosting the 2025 Elevate conference in NYC on Sep 17th-18th. Goldman Sachs maintains a BUY rating and $270 PT on the stock, and I expect we'll get more information about the AI hyped digital workers and product powerups the company has been teasing during Elevate.\n\nAlso Congressman Bresnahan, the guy who said he'd ban trading in congress, bought MNDY twice this year alongside his other tech purchases NVDA and SNOW.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wae1lde29hmf1.png?width=708&format=png&auto=webp&s=5ceea4406926a07579ae4f2c0e036beca8ae3c4a\n\nEDIT: People even more regarded than me seem to think this is a post about my retirement nest egg, it\u2019s a bet on a two month recovery rally then I\u2019m dumping my bags on some other moron ",

Beijing has also put pressure on tech giants, including Alibaba and ByteDance, over purchases of the H20 chip.\n\nNvidia developed the H20 specifically for China following U.S. export restrictions on its other AI processors in 2023. The H20 does not have as much computing power as Nvidia's H100 or its Blackwell series.\n\nAlibaba is China's biggest cloud-computing company and is among the top customers of Nvidia.\n\nSeparately, on Friday, the company reported a 26% jump in revenue in its cloud computing segment for the April-June quarter, beating market estimates, on the back of solid demand.",

Seriously, divine intervention. Ended up putting about $6k into NDVL (2x Long NVDA ETF) and it\u2019s down like $300, so no stress.

    "selftext": "TLDR: AMD finally caught up to NVDA, the market doesn\u2019t realize, go giga long $AMD. \n\nBuy $TLT just incase market crashes so you don\u2019t blow your account up in a black swan, or if thesis is wrong. \n\n\nTrade Setup:\n\t\u2022\t33% Portfolio: AMD calls 12/17/27, $360 strike (111% out of the money as of today)\n\t\u2022\t66% Portfolio: $TLT shares (U.S. Treasury bonds)\n\n$AMD Thesis In A Nutshell:\n\n$NVDA market cap: $4.4T\n$AMD market cap: $270B\n\nThe world is in a massive race to get more chips, and NVDA looks on track for a $10T market cap.\n\nFor the first time starting this quarter, AMD\u2019s MI355X is on par with NVDA, with cheaper chips. Sam Altman promoted the MI400 and MI450 at an AI event earlier this year. Hyperscaler consensus is that they are testing the MI350 this year to get familiar with integrating AMD into their data centers, so they will be ready to place big orders next year for the rack scale MI400 and MI450. This was noted on the most recent earnings call.\n\nFrom here on, AMD\u2019s chips will be on par, if not better, than NVDA for inference, which both Jensen Huang and Sam Altman agree will grow 1000x+ from current demand levels. Jensen said this on the GP2 podcast interview.\n\nIn 2024, AMD did $12B in data center revenue with inferior chips, while NVDA did $115B. If AMD can do $55B in 2027, which is half of NVDA\u2019s 2024 data center revenue, it is easily a $1T company, or an $800 stock.\n\nEverything suggests AMD will have a competitive product at a competitive price point, with demand setting up to be off the charts in 2026 and 2027, similar to NVDA\u2019s neck breaking 2023 and 2024 growth rates of 100%+.\n\nSecond Leg Of Trade:\n\nIf there is a recession or a black swan event, the Fed will cut rates and send TLT soaring, making up for a $0 AMD option. This is a simple hedge against a Covid style scenario.\n\nBest Case:\n\t\u2022\tTLT gains 50% to 100% from rate cuts on 66% of my portfolio\n\t\u2022\tAMD 4x in 2.5 years from AI chip demand, with calls returning 20x on 33% of my portfolio\n\nBase Case:\n\t\u2022\tAMD calls go to $0 if NVDA outcompetes AMD like in past AI failures such as MI300\n\t\u2022\tTLT rises as rates come down, which recovers the call premiums and results in break even in about 2.5 years\n\nWorst Case:\n\t\u2022\tAMD calls go to $0\n\t\u2022\tTLT drops because inflation spikes, resulting in a 30% loss there as well. This is unlikely in my opinion but possible.\n\nMI350X and MI355X should already drive healthy growth for AMD. However, MI400 will be the real game changer because of its scalability. AMD already raised the price for MI350, which just went into production, to $25,000 per chip. MI400 will be a true rack scale solution, making it highly competitive for large cluster projects.\n\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/amd-hikes-mi350-ai-gpu-205052675.html",

    "selftext": "**TL;DR at the bottom--** [**previous DD** ](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1m5yp45/muted_results_but_booming_guidance_nvda_q2/)**on Q2 Earnings, my wrist is healing well thank you**  \n\n\n# Leaning into AI Criticism: \n\nOn every post I make that is longer than 5 complete sentences, someone accuses the post of being written by AI. I only take offense to that notion because my analysis and writing is far more valuable than what any AI could produce. I am putting this to the test by asking the new and exciting GPT5 model for its own estimates which will be included in my comparisons to analysts.  \n\n\n# Updates to My Estimates:\n\nOverall, there are only minimal changes to the [initial post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1m5yp45/muted_results_but_booming_guidance_nvda_q2/) a few weeks ago. In the interest of Reddit attention spans, I will only highlight the changes and new totals.  \n  \n**Total Revenue: $46.4B**, Up $0.25 (Gaming Increase)  \n**EPS: $1.03**, Up $0.01 (Increased Revenue)  \n\n\n# A New Challenger in GPT5:\n\n[Headline Estimates from GPT5](https://preview.redd.it/y7h3eiw0cuhf1.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=d9332c28885bdbec364be95f7efe16ecefe3d122)\n\nI fed my previous posts to GPT5 (they're on Reddit anyway) and prompted it to come up with its own estimates. The above image shows the headline projections from GPT and its bullish estimates prompted me to ask for a segment breakdown. \n\n[Revenue by Segment and EPS](https://preview.redd.it/5ut7zj4ccuhf1.png?width=1562&format=png&auto=webp&s=66f3898cf08e8c71f25064cd9611a61cb05ef3c3)\n\nGPT5 is expecting strong numbers from NVDA's Data Center Segment, while its Gaming and Prof. Visualization estimates are lower than mine. GPT5 is slightly more bullish Robo & Auto than I am.   \n\n\n# The Estimates Stacked Up:\n\n[GPT5 noted this as a fair way to represent their estimates](https://preview.redd.it/9u6xxt9wcuhf1.png?width=1756&format=png&auto=webp&s=a6270483896b29093ca5d80ac7db2f1f61adb0c3)\n\nThis is what the three estimates look like stacked against each other, and it now offers a wide range of perspectives. Analyst consensus is almost always conservative (going on 3 consecutive years of beats), so comparing my detailed analysis to a likely-sandbagged estimate is hardly fair. Since AI is supposed to take my job as an analyst, let's see how the actuals compare.  \n\n\n# Positions:\n\nStill in my 200 shares and ATM (Bit ITM now) Covered Calls, looking to manage in September or October.   \n\n\n[$175 Calls at around 0.60 Delta Early August](https://preview.redd.it/4ioivgxjeuhf1.jpg?width=1179&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7f834007b66898571302f5691d4b081a1c1ea39d)\n\n\n\n# TLDR:\n\n\\- My Estimates Increased Slightly to $1.03 EPS on $46.4 Billion in Revenue  \n\\- Leaning into AI Criticism by Introducing GPT5 as an Analyst to Compare to  \n\\- Three estimates range in aggressiveness (AI then Me then Analyst Consensus)  \n\\- Still in 200 shares and short Covered Calls that have \\~0.60 Delta Each",

    "selftext": "Everyone and their mom thinks AI will replace humans, send us to the nearest star, and grant us immortalityall within the next five years. I can't even scroll online without seeing the word \"AI.\" AI this, AI that. But here's what I've learned from the crypto and NFT crazes: when everyone thinks something will change the world, it usually goes the exact opposite direction.\n\nI expect a **massive spike up in NVDA** after the Fed lowers rates, but give it a year or two max, and reality is going to hit us like a freight train, bro. **AI is the most massive bubble we have ever seen**, and the reckoning will be worse than the housing market crash. Here are my main reasons why:\n\n1. **AI is the greatest illusion of our time.** I've used ChatGPT plenty. It's great at generating word salad and generic code, but when it comes to doing **ACTUAL work** or fixing real problems, it just gives you more word salad instead of solutions. They claim AI can pass the hardest math tests? Sure, it can, because they've already fed it the answers. Try this: go to ChatGPT or any AI model and give it five documents with daily returns for five stocks. Ask it to generate a table showing each company's return for every six-month interval. All models will fail. Not only would it take ages, but it would require running Python code to even attempt it, instead of just giving you the direct answer.\n2. **The biggest players in the industry CEOs, VCs, investment fund heads who are throwing the most money around have zero technical skills and absolutely no idea how LLMs actually work.** They're either straight-up lying to pump up their stocks, or they're genuinely retarded, thinking something that runs on a Mac Studio is intelligent or anything close to that. CEOs are always right, right? Remember when Zuck renamed his entire company after the metaverse? That same guy said AI would replace all developers by mid-2025. Well, here we are in mid-2025, and not only has Meta paid the most money ever for a developer, but guess what? They have 2,000 job openings for engineers!\n3. **All these keynotes promoting AI seem specifically tailored for investors they don't care about anyone else.** It's like they're screaming, \"BUY OUR STOCK, IT WILL GO TO THE MOON,\" but they can't legally say it. Jensen Huang has been openly mocking Masayoshi Son about selling NVDA stock at every public appearance, almost like he'll do the same to you if you sell!\n4. **So far, companies have invested massively and saved very little money.** Microsoft, for example, recently claimed they saved $500 million because of AI, but they also invested $50 billion. The media went into a frenzy reporting on how much money they saved, as if $500 million is a great return on $50 billion.\n5. **In Silicon Valley, the craziness has reached unimaginable heights.** Everyone and their dog has an AI startup getting $50 million in seed money, promising \"agentic AI models\" that will analyze your cat's poop and order Amazon food based on its constipation levels. On LinkedIn alone, there are 20,000 job openings in San Francisco for AI engineers, while there are only about 1,000 actual AI engineers available. Companies like Meta are paying $200 million for top engineers.\n6. **There's almost no competitive advantage anymore, as open-source models are nearly as good as private ones.** All the big companies are monopolies in their fields. How can you maintain a monopoly when your product is free, open source, and runs on a Mac Studio?\n7. **All major AI companies have predicted AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) would be here by now.** Yet, AGI is always \"one year away.\"\n8. **When everyone thinks something will happen, it always goes the other direction.**\n9. **Big, revolutionary changes have never happened in a year or two.** The internet, for example, took 20 years to achieve mass adoption.",

    "title": "Muted Results but Booming Guidance: NVDA Q2 Earnings Analysis",
    "selftext": "**TL;DR at the bottom--I broke my wrist touching grass last weekend so this** ***is*** **the short version**\n\nThis is my third consecutive quarter posting an independent analysis of NVDA\u2019s quarterly earnings. My Q4 FY25 and Q1 FY26 estimates are available on my profile, and a comparison to analyst consensus and actual results in those quarters can be seen below.\n\n[Note 2025Q1 Refers to Non-GAAP H20 Excluded](https://preview.redd.it/mmfycac78bef1.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=4f6bdebbe39904b4b4e944ef04c1020325685bdf)\n\n[While Analysts Consistently Underestimate Revenue, My Bullish Bias has Decreased Significantly](https://preview.redd.it/zvdf6kug8bef1.png?width=848&format=png&auto=webp&s=bf6b37820b364715f26fbff6c646388c7c67959d)\n\nOn last quarter's earnings call, the Company guided for a considerable slowdown in revenue growth. They noted that the forecast included a negative impact of $8 billion from losing access to China. Jensen was particularly open on the call, saying,\n\n\u201cOn export control... the platform that wins China is positioned to lead globally. Today, however, the $50 billion China market is effectively closed to U.S. industry.\u201d\n\nJensen has been consistently meeting with Trump and his administration to get back into China. As recently as July 14th, NVDA provided a positive update on this disruption in a blog post, telling investors they are going to regain the ability to do so soon. Unfortunately, this will likely not affect revenue in Q2, but could lead to optimism from The Company when issuing guidance for Q3 and beyond.\n\nLike in Q1, I will analyze each of the four main revenue segments and create a combined estimate. Since the Data Center segment is both the largest and in the spotlight, I will start there. \n\n# Data Center Estimate:\n\nWhen issuing guidance, Colette Kress (CFO) stated the following: \u201cTotal revenue is expected to be $45 billion, plus or minus 2%. We expect modest sequential growth across all of our platforms. In Data Center, we anticipate the continued ramp of Blackwell to be partially offset by a decline in China revenue.\u201d  \n  \nThe Blackwell ramp is expected to be completely recognized this quarter, yet the segment is set to only experience \u201cmodest growth\u201d due to being locked out of China. The H20 sales halt hit with about three weeks left in Q1, and revenue grew 9.83% QoQ. NVDA still does not have the license required to sell in China, with less than two weeks left in Q2. A re-acceleration of growth seems unlikely this quarter, and my initial estimate is closer to 5-7% growth (\\~$41 to $42 billion).\u00a0\n\n[The Graph Shows Revenue from Data Centers Since 2024Q1 and Highlights the Deceleration in 2025Q1.](https://preview.redd.it/7n0g32oz8bef1.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=d31bb77ea496875aa86919a961199b793d099415)\n\nThe negative impact from the disruption in China will be the largest in Q2, which suggests a continued slowdown in QoQ growth. $41.5 billion would represent just over 6% growth, and with the current data and outlook, it will serve as the preliminary estimate.\n\n# Gaming Estimate:\n\nThe rebound in gaming revenue in Q1 outpaced even the most bullish estimates. The record $3.8 billion in Q1 revenue represented a \\~50% QoQ increase and was over 15% higher than the previous record. The report cites strength from the partnership with Nintendo (Switch 2) and the CFO noted, \u201cStrong adoption by gamers, creatives, and AI enthusiasts.\u201d The gaming beat helped NVDA\u2019s headline revenue total in Q1, and The Company is optimistic strength will continue. However, given the cyclical nature of gaming and Q1 being such a positive surprise, it is difficult to project further QoQ growth to another record. $3.5 billion in Q2 would achieve 20% YoY growth in this segment and will serve as the preliminary estimate.\n\n[Visualization of Strong Rebound in Gaming Revenue in 2025Q1](https://preview.redd.it/a001knqd9bef1.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=73ce824ea06d28dd1f08ba742e551b97b7cd20ec)\n\n# Prof. Visualization / Robotics & Auto Estimate:\n\nIn the interest of time, and given that these two segments combined for barely over $1 billion in Q1, these two segments are being bundled into one breakdown. Prof. Visualization was mentioned by the CFO on the conference call and is expected to return to QoQ growth after being flat in Q1. Robotics & Auto was down sequentially in Q1 but still up over 70% YoY. There was no mention of expectations in Q2. I currently have \\~$1.15 billion for the two segments combined, and will look to fine-tune this closer to the release date.\n\n# Total Revenue Estimate: $46.15 Billion\n\n\n\n# Earnings Estimate:\n\nOn the Q1 report, NVDA added a Non-GAAP EPS line that specifically excluded the H20 charge. It came in at $0.96 per share, surpassing the consensus of $0.93 but falling $0.01 short of my $0.97 estimate. \n\nThere was some initial confusion surrounding the three metrics as \u201cregular\u201d Non-GAAP EPS came in at $0.81, much higher than the Factset analyst consensus of $0.73. \n\nIn Q2, NVDA will likely return to reporting the standard two EPS metrics, and yahoo finance lists the average estimate from 40 analysts at $1.00 per share. The earnings whisper number is a bit lower at $0.94, while the highest estimate from a single analyst is $1.09. \n\nWhile it is relatively easy to find consensus estimates for headline figures like EPS and Total Revenue, most analysts do not break out revenue by segment nor show how they convert top-line revenue to bottom-line profitability. This analysis shows the full process of forecasting revenue by segment and how it translates to the bottom-line in a form of unique transparency. \n\nThe last section established the revenue estimate, but to get to EPS, estimates need to be made for gross margin, operating expenses, non-operating expenses, and total shares outstanding. \n\nNVDA\u2019s company-issued guidance for both gross margin and operating expenses has been largely reliable in recent quarters. In Q2, the company expects gross margin of 72% and operating costs of $4 billion, which are used in this estimate. \n\nThe company does not issue guidance for non-operating expenses nor shares outstanding, but accurate estimates can be obtained. \n\n[Stabilization of Cost Increases in 2024 with uptick in 2025Q1](https://preview.redd.it/ulf2s2nz9bef1.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=38ed7a3d33b88cfaf4134645ffd638b043f67ca7)\n\nThe above graph shows historical data for non-operating expenses and QoQ growth for the segment. The growth rate has largely stabilized compared to previous years, even with an uptick in Q1. $4.0 billion would represent a decrease back to about 5% growth, while my current estimate of $4.1 billion represents an increase of just under 8%.\u00a0\n\nEstimating shares outstanding can be tricky, as the company\u2019s share repurchase program is inconsistent. NVDA still has about $25 billion authorized under the current plan for share repurchases, but that is down after aggressive buybacks in Q1.\u00a0\n\nThis analysis estimates about $9 billion in buybacks in Q2, reducing the shares outstanding from 24.61 to 24.55 billion (60m shares @ 150 = $9 B). The estimate is similar to the amount repurchased in Q4 and is lower than repurchases in Q1.\u00a0  \n\n\n[EPS Calculation Visualized, While Highlighting Opaqueness of Consensus](https://preview.redd.it/kglfaixaabef1.png?width=1924&format=png&auto=webp&s=8d95f34e8f6bf00b14d87a7d6d645d9e400bb658)\n\nThe calculation comes out to $1.02 EPS, which is slightly above the average analyst\u2019s expectations. $46.15 billion in revenue is also only slightly above the consensus.\u00a0\n\nThis is the closest my estimates have been to the consensus, which has been surpassed each of the last 10 quarters. Given that I expect relatively muted results this quarter, guidance for the rest of the year will be in focus during the call.\u00a0\n\n# Guidance:\n\nAfter the positive update on China sales, investors are looking for strong guidance. While it\u2019s not as straightforward as adding the lost $8 billion back into the forecast, analysts are expecting the worst to be in the past. Investors are looking for signs that the \u201cstart of the new wave\u201d Jensen mentioned last quarter will materialize this year.\u00a0\n\nThe current expectation for Q3 revenue is \\~$51.5 billion, an increase of 13% from Q2 expectations ($45.55). In Q1, revenue grew 10% QoQ to $44.06 billion. This means analysts expect just over 3% growth in the current quarter with notable re-acceleration in Q3.\u00a0\n\nAnalysts are looking for at least a piece of the Chinese market in Q3 with the $51.5 billion forecast. Q2 guidance would have been closer to $53 billion with full access to China, suggesting the Q3 forecast still projects some disruption in China near term.\u00a0\n\nIf NVDA signals a faster-than-expected ramp in sales to China, guidance expectations that already look strong could still be too low. However, any delays in the licensing process or misaligned inventory could dampen Q3\u2019s forecast.\u00a0\n\n# Valuation:\n\nRegardless of belief in the company, NVDA is expensive right now. \u201cExpensive\u201d in this case means that it is trading at higher multiples than multi-year averages.\u00a0\n\nEven using the H20 excluded EPS number from Q1, NVDA has earned $3.34 per share over the last four quarters. Trailing earnings are expected to increase to $3.66 after Q2\u2019s report, while full year EPS is currently expected to come in at around $4.30.\u00a0\n\nBased on a current price of \\~$173, NVDA is currently trading at over 51x TTM earnings, and 40x forward earnings.\n\nWhile NVDA has previously traded for 40x forward earnings, it has also traded for closer to 20x forward earnings as recently as this year.\u00a0\n\nNVDA is also currently experiencing an elevated Price to Sales ratio (higher than 75% of history) of over 28x sales, and its Price to Book ratio of 50x is more expensive than 91% of NVDA\u2019s history.\u00a0\n\nBuying NVDA at $170 makes sense only if the company continues to deliver bullish surprises on top of already sky-high expectations. I am not selling shares ahead of the report, even with the price outpacing my targets.\u00a0\n\n# Positions:\n\nWhen I began posting NVDA analysis and creating my price targets, NVDA traded for about $140 per share. At the time, I felt the price was fair, and it wasn\u2019t until the liberation day tariff sell-off to sub $90 that I began buying more aggressively.\u00a0\n\nI currently own 200 shares with a cost basis around $125. While I expected NVDA to recover rather quickly, the near 100% rally from April lows leads me to believe hype and FOMO are driving the price higher rather than fundamental growth. While NVDA\u2019s growth has been explosive, the current price leaves no room for negative catalysts.\u00a0\n\nBased on my expectations for NVDA in the rest of 2025, I sold an ATM covered call expiring in December. I am willing to sell at $175 between now and the end of the year, so I decided to collect $3000 ($1500 x2) selling that call option. I now have $15 of downside protection through December or will sell my shares for a massive profit.\u00a0\n\n[Holding 200 Shares While Short 2 Covered Calls \\($175 for 12\\/19\\)](https://preview.redd.it/wf8l9bh8bbef1.jpg?width=1179&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0cd9d2477ba06b5bd2f14f402b097b295a3ceac9)\n\n\n\n# TL;DR\n\n**\u2043\u00a0 \u00a0 Slight consensus beat in Q2**\u00a0  \n**\u2043\u00a0 \u00a0 Strong guidance for 2H FY25**  \n**\u2043\u00a0 \u00a0 Valuation concerns**  \n**\u2043\u00a0 \u00a0 Holding 200 shares @ 125 with ATM ccs ($175) for December**  \n**\u2043\u00a0 \u00a0 Most detailed breakdown of earnings from any analyst**",

    "selftext": "I've lost a lot of sleep over the past 18 months trading my mom's IRA (she's more than ok with this!), and I've been able to substantially outperform the market.  I lost most of her portfolio 3 months ago in April (bottom tick was $800k) but have been able to grow it back to a much higher value than it was before the tariff BS.\n\nTotal gains in 18 months: $4,000,000\n\nI have been trading options (obviously, this is WSB.) For the first 6 months, my big winner was HIMS, although I sold WAY too early. I bought calls around $10 and sold around $20-$24. My other big plays have been scalping NVDA and especially GOOGL. Despite being a lousy hold for the last year, I've consistently YOLO'd into GOOGL on big pull backs, including the Apple congressional testimony news (Google searches were down for the first time on Safari, although Google denied this.)\n\nMy strategy is to buy near or at-the-money calls 2-5 months out with at least one earnings in between. I don't usually hold through earnings. I try to scale out of the position over the course of 2-10 trading days. I'm happy with 20%-50% gains and am fine with leaving money on the table. Because the calls are many months out, there isn't too much theta decay if the stock goes sideways.\n\nI generally keep cash on the side to YOLO into calls if there's a huge overreaction on a given ticker. If I'm fully invested, it's hard to take advantage of certain opportunities. I don't think I have that much patience, but I've definitely improved since my early trading days.\n\nOn Friday I sold most of the portfolio and am now 85%  in cash. The other 15% is in QQQ puts and UNH calls. I think there will be buying opportunities soon given the new EU / Canada tariff news, but ultimately, as we all know, taco's gonna taco.",

    "title": "$POET -- THE 10 BAGGER YOU DON'T KNOW ABOUT",
    "selftext": "If you've been on WSB for any time at all, you've read a new DD and thought, \"This guy is a moron; his play will never work\"\u2014only to check the ticker a couple weeks later and see it's already up over 100%. This is your chance to right that wrong and make a shit ton of money in the process.\n\n**SKIP THIS PART IF RETARDED:**\n\nThanks to NVDA and Co, computer chips are faster than ever. The problem? Electronic data transmission can't keep up. Because of thermodynamics, the fastest that data can effectively be electronically transmitted at the chip level is around 100Gbps-ish. In order to maximize the power of those NVDA chips companies pay millions for, they'll HAVE TO switch to photonics (data transmission using light). Okay, so who is making this technology? A lot of companies (Broadcom, Mitsubishi, Foxconn, Lumentum, etc). The tricky part is converting between electronic data from the chips and photonic data from the transmission modules. This is where POET Technologies comes in (here is their website, if you want to try to better understand what they do: [POET](https://www.poet-technologies.com/))\n\nPOET is incredibly well-positioned for the inevitable photonics boom. Their partners include Foxconn, Mitsubishi, Celestial AI, Luxshare, Adtran, Mentech, and Lessengers. POET will supply these companies with Optical Interposers that they will add to their Optical Modules. Those companies will sell those Optical Modules to AI data centers, cloud computing, telecom, etc. Diagram for the mentally impaired:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nxasurdroxbf1.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=54fa88c56f66e8992752794c69041ccfc47ad597\n\nNow, POET is a pre-revenue company. However, the switch from electronic to photonic chip-level data transmission is happening *as we speak*. And so, the single most important statement of this entire DD: **POET WILL START SHIPPING ORDERS TO THEIR CUSTOMERS AND MAKING SIGNIFICANT REVENUE WITHIN THE NEXT MONTHS, WEEKS, OR DAYS.** The reason why this hasn't already started is because the customers in the final step of the diagram need to wait 6-9 months to test-run the technology before finalizing their orders -- standard practice in the industry ([Source](https://agoracom.com/ir/POETTechnologies/forums/discussion/topics/809555-OFC-Summary/messages/2434913?entity=thread&view=thread)). In other words, the orders have ALREADY BEEN PLACED, and everyone is simply waiting for the tests to conclude to actually start fulfilling them: \"In fact, \\[Rep. from POET customer\\] stated that they already have a large hyperscaler customer who has placed orders for the solution.\" [(](https://agoracom.com/ir/POETTechnologies/forums/discussion/topics/809555-OFC-Summary/messages/2434913?entity=thread&view=thread)[Source](https://agoracom.com/ir/POETTechnologies/forums/discussion/topics/809555-OFC-Summary/messages/2434913?entity=thread&view=thread)).\n\nWith such a small market cap, a skeptic might wonder how POET would be able to defend their valuable position in the industry. First, they have a shit ton of patents for their technology ([Source](https://patents.justia.com/assignee/poet-technologies-inc)). Additionally, their various partners/customers have incorporated POET's technology into a wide variety of transmission speeds: 400Gbps, 800Gbps, 1.6Tbps, and even 3.2Tbps. Right now, 1.6T and 3.2T are not needed in the vast majority of cases. However, as companies require faster and faster data transmission in the coming years, they'll still be buying optical modules with POET's tech inside. Because of this, I cannot reiterate enough how well-positioned POET is to capitalize on the AI / data center boom.\n\n**IF RETARDED, START READING HERE:**\n\nKnowing that POET will start making money hand-over-fist in the near future, the next step is to calculate how much they could actually make. Taken from their Q4 2024 earnings report:\n\n\"Established a major wafer-level assembly and test facility for optical engines in Penang, Malaysia with the signing of several agreements with Globetronics Manufacturing Sdn. Bhd., a leading semiconductor manufacturer and contractor, equipping Globetronics with the capacity to manufacture an initial **1 million POET optical engines annually**.\" ([Source](https://www.poet-technologies.com/news/poet-technologies-reports-fourth-quarter-2024-financial-results))\n\nBut that's not all. They recently made another manufacturing agreement for even more production, expected to be ready in 1 to 2 quarters:\n\n\"POET Technologies has signed a manufacturing agreement with NationGate Solutions in Malaysia to produce optical engine assemblies, enhancing its manufacturing capabilities and **addressing growing customer demand**.\" ([Source](https://www.tipranks.com/news/company-announcements/poet-technologies-expands-manufacturing-with-nationgate-in-malaysia))\n\nBecause the Globetronics facility is already up and running ([Source](https://x.com/POETtech/status/1938241918712090821)), I'll be conservative and use the production numbers from that facility alone. Again, being conservative, I'll average the 400G and 800G optical units at $250 a pop. 1M units \\* $250 / unit is $250M. Multiply that by a P/S ratio of 10, and you get a market cap of $2.5B -- representing a **5X** from the current market cap of $500M. And that revenue is going to start pouring in any day. But let's get crazy and estimate what this could be 3 years in the future. 3M units \\* $500 / unit (accounting for 1.6T, 3.2T being more expensive) \\* 10 P/S ratio = $15B market cap -- **30X upside** from current share price.\n\nThe best part about this situation? Wall Street doesn't care enough about pre-revenue microcaps to understand POET's potential. Once institutions take the time to understand POET's position in a rapidly burgeoning industry, this thing will practically double overnight (And yes, I know that it's already up over 50% from the recent lows. I posted this as soon as this got above the $500M mkt cap requirement).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gfcstni4cybf1.png?width=724&format=png&auto=webp&s=a4e5793fb2e02108aa0b06dc6a1f7434d0c9df55\n\nIf this stock gets ANY sort of public attention, the market will quickly re-price its valuation. Coupled with the incoming slew of positive news (fulfilled purchase orders, revenue, new products, etc), this has the potential to go on a crazy run. The only caveat is that I can't tell you when exactly this could happen. POET's CEO has reiterated that H2 2025 will bring revenue -- I'd guess orders start getting announced before September. That doesn't mean you should go and buy calls expiring in a month, though.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n8yvi1vq6ybf1.png?width=1505&format=png&auto=webp&s=a7336f25c19e73565ad46e676de4dd2981ecbbc3\n\nThe easiest way to play this is to buy shares and chill -- I am almost certain that POET will at least double by the end of the year. If you happen to be a degenerate gambler and are morally against buying shares -- go for 1/16/26 or 1/15/27 10c. The options chain is stupidly bullish, and it could easily gamma squ\\*eze if the share price continues to go up and degenerates continue buying OTM calls.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1c0jwnvt7ybf1.png?width=713&format=png&auto=webp&s=2a1f8fa4fe4b1f09fdb7837a6ccd1d25b5f4338c\n\nMy base case is $12/share by EOY, and $30/share by Q3 2026. My optimistic case is $30/share by EOY, and $45-60/share (3.75B to 5B mkt cap) by Q3 2026. We could easily see $60 or higher sooner than that if you get hype and news at the right time.\n\n**TL;DR** \\-- POET, a $500M mkt cap photonics company, is on the cusp of generating significant revenue. Think of the potential for an immediate 5X return, minimum. The market is largely unaware of this stock, and it will undergo a dramatic re-pricing in the coming weeks and months. Buy into the next multi-bagger BEFORE it happens.\n\n**Position:**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u1mznr6eiybf1.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=e141a3a0cfd18937d352df8bc6ec3079afe133e9\n\nEDIT: Initially forgot about this, but they've won a bunch of awards for their technology. Doesn't really mean much for share price, but it's evidence that this whole thing isn't vaporware. \n\n**2025 Lightwave\u202fAward \u2013 \u201cOutstanding AI Hardware\u201d** ([Source](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/04/01/3053451/0/en/POET-Receives-Lightwave-Award-for-Outstanding-AI-Hardware-at-OFC-Conference.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com))\n\n**2025 AI Breakthrough Awards \u2013 \u201cAI Hardware Innovation Award\u201d** ([Source](https://www.semiconductor-digest.com/poet-wins-ai-hardware-innovation-award-in-2025-ai-breakthrough-awards/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))\n\n**2024 Global Tech Awards \u2013 \u201cBest in Artificial Intelligence\u201d** ([Source](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2024/10/16/2963913/0/en/POET-Wins-Best-in-Artificial-Intelligence-Honors-at-2024-Global-Tech-Awards.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com))\n\n**2024 Merit Awards \u2013 \u201cAI Innovator of the Year\u201d** ([Source](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2024/10/01/2956257/0/en/POET-Wins-AI-Innovator-of-the-Year-Gold-Prize-at-2024-Merit-Awards.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com))\n\n**2024 AI Breakthrough Awards \u2013 \u201cBest Optical AI Solution\u201d** ([Source](https://www.gophotonics.com/news/details/7032-poet-technologies-receives-best-optical-ai-solution-award-at-2024-ai-breakthrough-awards-program?utm_source=chatgpt.com))",

The $192k premium and $465k \u201ccash\u201d are in money market collecting 4 percent interest, which will yield another $6,700 between now and 9/19.\n\nThere are 64 more trading days left between now and expiration, IV is at 107%, 8-9% short position relative to float. Currently nvda holds a 7% stake in coreweave and a strategic partnership, which was partially responsible for the run up. Below is a summary of the partnership from nvda:\n\n\u201cThe general availability of NVIDIA GB200 NVL72-based instances on CoreWeave underscores the latest in the companies\u2019 collaboration, focused on delivering the latest accelerated computing solutions to the cloud. With the launch of these instances, enterprises now have access to the scale and performance needed to power the next wave of AI reasoning models and agents.\n\nCustomers can start provisioning GB200 NVL72-based instances through CoreWeave Kubernetes Service in the US-WEST-01 region using the gb200-4x instance ID. To get started, contact CoreWeave.\u201d\n\nCoreweave owns data centers in the US and Canada including the fastest super computer in the world that is powered by nvda chips. The strategic partnership (as well as ownership stake) gives coreweave dibs on the latest nvda chips, which gives coreweave a leg up over its competitors. In addition to Nvda, Microsoft is another major client. It is my opinion that we are just at the beginning of an AI arms race, coreweave is in a fantastic position to reap  the benefits from money from both private and public sectors indiscriminately flowing into anything related to AI. \n\nBiggest concerns include 1) 325% 3 months run making coreweave susceptible to major pull back, and 2) geopolitical tensions and tariff wars may tank the market. \n\nHowever, the concerns are short term, and are alleviated by the large premium (my break even is $87.94), the stock would need to drop almost 50% from Wednesday close for me to incur a loss. Worst case scenario, I am forced to buy 3,100 shares at a loss, I will sell covered calls and wheel my way to profitability. \n\nBest case scenario is that coreweave closes in the $150 range with high IV on 9/19 and I get to run it back again, while collecting more premium and interest.",

    "title": "$APLD: This ain\u2019t a stock. It\u2019s a launchpad. Public Pureplay on the AI Bottleneck.",
    "selftext": "I\u2019m long APLD.\n\nApplied Digital is a developer of next-generation infrastructure for AI. They have two segments: (i) custom-built, high-performance data centers; and (ii) GPUs as a service. Applied is currently focused on a large 400MW data center project in Ellendale, ND, and is marketing a 1.4GW pipeline of additional capacity. Please see the company\u2019s latest investor presentation on their website for more details. \n\nThere is a frenzy for compute power by both hyperscalers and Fortune 500 companies, covered extensively everywhere you look. Power and datacenter capacity is the new bottleneck. Nvidia\u2019s CEO, Jensen, has and continues to discuss the need to modernize a trillion dollars worth of data centers to tap into AI\u2019s potential. APLD is a first mover aiming to capture this opportunity.\n\nAPLD\u2019s history in developing power hungry crypto hosting sites in low-cost power locations was the perfect preparation for today\u2019s AI opportunity. APLD\u2019s foray into North Dakota for cheap electricity to fund crypto mining left the company with relationships and access to massive low cost power, low cost land with space for expansion, room for additional wind/solar farms to be integrated, state tax incentives, and cooler temperatures which are beneficial for the TCO of high density AI data centers. A healthy dose of luck contributed to locking up this opportunity, industry participants have told me you cannot underscore just how valuable this power and first mover advantage is for prospective customers. If GPUs are the pickaxes behind the AI revolution, power guys are swinging the axes.\n\n**Unit Economics and Valuation**\n\n**HPC Data Centers**\nThe rule of thumb for data centers is it costs $8-12 million per MW to build and each MW can generate ~$1mm of NOI. Applied Digital\u2019s Ellendale campus has signed 250 MW of 15-year leases with CoreWeave, expected to generate $7 billion of total revenue over those 15 years (\u2248$466.7 million per year). That works out to \u2248$1.867 million of revenue per MW per year. Assuming a typical HPC/data center EBITDA margin of 50\u201360 %, each MW will likely produce $0.9\u2013$1.2 million of NOI per year. Therefore, the 250 MW currently under contract should yield $233\u2013$280 million of NOI annually. At a 5\u20136 % cap rate, that implies an enterprise value (TEV) in the $3.9\u2013$5.6 billion range for the signed 250 MW. If the full 400 MW build is leased at similar economics, total NOI would be $360\u2013$480 million per year, implying TEV of $6\u2013$9.6 billion. The remaining 150 MW of backlog could contribute up to $150 million of additional annual NOI\u2014i.e., another $2.5\u2013$3 billion of TEV\u2014if signed at comparable rates. \n\nLocking in the 250 MW CoreWeave lease translates into roughly $3.3\u2013$5.17b of equity, or about $15\u2013$23 per share. Each additional 100 MW of backlog, using $0.9\u2013$1.2 m of NOI per MW and a 5\u20136 % cap rate, would be worth approximately $5/share using the same math. If Applied is able to lock in 1.4GW of projects, that\u2019s an additional $70/share of value that could be created. Haircut all of this however you prefer. The numbers can get wild.\n\n**Applied Digital Cloud**\nThis segment has not been a focus for the company or the investment community recently, but is an underappreciated lotto ticket. Think of it as an early-stage CoreWeave. The business model is simple: they purchase GPUs from NVDA, install them in data centers, and lease them to customers for a fixed contract term that is typically 2-3 years. The GPUs typically pay for themselves during the initial lease term, leaving Applied Digital Cloud owning them free and clear at the end of the lease term for several more years of use. Applied takes very little risk here because at the time they purchase the GPUs there is already a contract in place for a full pay back of the equipment.\n\nThe NVDA investment is especially important for this segment because this is where NVDA can drive Applied\u2019s future success. The hyperscalers are working on their own chips and are frienemies, so it is in NVDA\u2019s long-term interest to ensure that there is a healthy ecosystem to support the consumption of their GPUs. They want companies like Applied and CoreWeave to prosper. NVDA can assure Applied\u2019s success in a variety of ways by providing: (i) early allocations of the latest products; (ii) the best customer prospects who want to consume NVDA\u2019s products as a service; and (iii) capital.\n\nConsider what NVDA\u2019s support did for CoreWeave. NVDA invested $100MM in CoreWeave in 2023 at a $2BN valuation. As of September 2024 CoreWeave was raising money at a $23BN valuation\u2026. And look at where they are now. \n\nValuing this segment is tricky because it is just getting started. If we assume it\u2019s worth just 10% of CoreWeave, that\u2019s $7BN. And it goes up from there. In the fullness of time, if Applied Digital Cloud prospers, then the company will spin this out as a separate company.   \n\n**The High Level Setup**\nBased on the recently announced data center lease with CoreWeave, it is clear that APLD is the real deal and has a chance to be a leader in the next gen data center buildout. BUT despite the recent surge in stock price, it has yet to go from zero to hero with the stock price still being vastly under valued.\n \nApplied Digital will be the only pure play next-gen data center player in the public markets. There is no short thesis when NVDA and Related are anchor investors and a hyperscaler is a long-term partner and customer. APLD will fundamentally be worth a lot more than current prices, the stock should disconnect from any fundamental grounding as a result of being a public pureplay on the next AI bottleneck. The right tail asymmetry of this investment is under appreciated.  \n\n**TLDR:** Company that used to mine magic internet money accidentally built a gold mine for AI. Now NVDA\u2019s homies are renting it out, and the GPU gods might bless them with infinite tendies. Bags secured, brain not required\n\n[Positions](https://imgur.com/a/iJFz6g7)",

Not going to be a pig\u2026 having BA drop to $200 or less would hurt WAY more than BA running to $240 would feel good. So ready to unload these bags and today I did. \n  \nTL;DR \u2014 aped into BA early last year. Got slaughtered. Aped in even more. Finally got unstuck and made a whopping $250 for my troubles. ",

The next closest gain for an S&P 500 company in that time period is a 540% pop for Vistra Corp ([VST](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/VST)).Nvidia has established itself as the key provider of chips needed to operate AI systems. Now at the epicenter of an AI arms race, Nvidia has established itself as[\u00a0a cornerstone of the recent bull market](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/live/stock-market-today-tech-leads-stocks-higher-as-nvidia-surges-to-record-high-175727614.html)\u00a0in stocks as the company's sales and profits have skyrocketed over the past several years.\n\nAhead of the\u00a0[company's next quarterly earnings release on May 28](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-to-report-q1-earnings-as-middle-east-deals-export-control-reprieve-boost-stock-122728218.html), we broke down some of the most eye-popping charts that show how Nvidia became one of the most-followed stocks in the market.There's perhaps no clearer way to see how Nvidia ran away from the competition in the AI boom than looking at the company's market capitalization against its peers. Back when ChatGPT launched, Nvidia had a market cap of just over $400 billion. It's now over $3.3 trillion. Over that same time period, chip competitor Intel's ([INTC](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/INTC)) market cap has actually decreased, while Advanced Micro Devices' ([AMD](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMD)) market cap has increased incrementally from $125 billion to $177 billion.Nvidia's rise proved to be at the center of a new technological boom. Combined with Nvidia, the rise in dominance of six other companies \u2014 Apple ([AAPL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL)), Alphabet ([GOOGL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOGL),\u00a0[GOOG](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOG)), Microsoft ([MSFT](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MSFT)), Amazon ([AMZN](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMZN)), Meta ([META](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/META)), and Tesla ([TSLA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA)) \u2014 formed what would come to be known as the\u00a0[\"Magnificent Seven.\"](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/one-chart-shows-how-the-magnificent-7-have-dominated-the-stock-market-in-2023-203250125.html)\n\nThe group began the AI boom with a combined market cap just shy of $7 billion. Now, two and a half years later, the Big Tech group's market cap is worth over $16.8 trillion. The seven companies have grown from about 22% of the S&P 500's market cap in November 2022 to 32% of the index's market cap today.Given the outsized weighting in the S&P 500, large swings in shares of Nvidia have become a feature of how even broad market investors are thinking about the direction of stocks. In June 2024,[\u00a0three Wall Street strategists boosted their year-end S&P 500 targets](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ai-enthusiasm-prompts-3-wall-street-banks-to-raise-stock-market-forecasts-100027154.html), citing better-than-expected consistent performance among key AI players.\n\nAs of May 19, the Magnificent Seven have accounted for about 52% of the S&P 500's gain since Nov. 30, 2022. Nvidia alone has contributed 17.21%, by far the most among the group, with the next closest stock, Microsoft, which has added about 8.8%.Nvidia's stock hasn't been rising from just hype. The company's quarterly financial metrics have soared. In the quarter ChatGPT launched, Nvidia posted revenue of $6.3 billion. Two years later, it would post revenue of $35.3 billion. That's a 460% increase in sales in two years. As seen in the chart below, the main source of growth for Nvidia has been its data center revenue segment, which includes the sales of its AI chips.\n\nFrom the company's fourth quarter of 2023 to its final quarter of its 2025 reporting period, data center revenue grew almost 900%.\n\nNvidia's data center revenue particularly stands out when considering its rise against peers in the industry. In the final quarter of 2024, Nvidia notched a record $35.58 billion in just data center revenue, up from $3.62 billion in the final quarter of 2022.\n\nIn comparison, Alphabet's data center revenue increased to $11.96 billion, ending 2024 up from $7.32 billion in the final quarter of 2022.\n\n\n\n",

NVDA\u2019s EPS has increased QoQ since 2022, when both Q2 and Q3 EPS were $0.03, down from $0.06 in Q1. The image below shows the trend and revisions for analysts\u2019 EPS estimates this quarter.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2cew4jyvet2f1.png?width=1046&format=png&auto=webp&s=9583d6f1ac0e6d4f870e6da9b8329198681e3e99\n\nThe current average estimate is around $0.73 within a week of the release.\u00a0**That is a decrease of over 20% from the previous consensus, and calls for NVDA\u2019s first decline in EPS QoQ since 2022.**\u00a0So what\u2019s causing this massive shift in expectations?\n\nPeople will quickly cite the $5.5 billion charge \u201cfor inventory, purchase commitments, and related reserves\u201d as the reason for such a drop,\u00a0**which is completely wrong.**\n\nThe charge will almost certainly be listed as a GAAP Non-Operating Expense, meaning that the Non-GAAP expense segments should be minimally impacted. Headlines report the non-GAAP EPS number, meaning the downward revisions have more to do with the indirect impacts of the China export ban and other trade controls, rather than the direct $5.5 billion charge.\n\nA deeper look into the estimates will show that data center revenue and data center margin have seen the most significant negative revisions. The revisions come in response to the H20 ban, which resulted in a loss of 2 weeks of sales in China, and changed the product mix as a % of sales in the quarter.\n\nThese are two negative impacts on profitability, with sales and margin on those sales both seeing steep declines. However, it appears analysts may be overestimating how much revenue was lost from those two weeks in China, and may have completely misunderstood how margins will be impacted entirely.\n\nAccording to Business Daily, China sales represented 13% of NVDA\u2019s revenue last year, and the share of sales in China has been trending down. Since 2 weeks of a 13 week quarter is about 15% of the total time, and about 13% of revenue from that two weeks is gone, basic math tells us Data Center Revenue should decrease by roughly 2%.\n\nMy initial estimate was $41.0 billion, and decreasing it by 2% would amount to about $40.2 billion. Analyst consensus is sitting around $38.5 billion according to Nasdaq(dot)com, an increase of only 8.1% QoQ. Below is a graph of Data Center Revenue for the past 11 quarters, shown in blue, with the red point being analyst estimates for the current quarter.\n\n[The Consensus is a massive slowdown this quarter](https://preview.redd.it/2rosyfazet2f1.png?width=1967&format=png&auto=webp&s=d4715f993863c35850b5e96c315e0c5a05e12a7d)\n\nAs for the impact on gross margin, analysts have revised their estimates down due to the shift in product mix without the H20 chips and other China products.\n\nAccording to Yahoo Finance, H20 chips were estimated in the 50% range for margins, and their recent strength actually put downward pressure on margins. This means it is unlikely that the new product mix has a significantly lower margin than pre-H20 ban.\n\nThe company-issued guidance for gross margin in the current quarter is 71%, with the average analyst now expecting 68.4% according to CMC Markets.\n\nSince the total revenue average estimate is $43.1 billion, and $38.5 billion is data center revenue, we know the other three segments are estimated to contribute $4.6 billion to total revenue.\n\nI estimate $4.2 billion from the remaining segments, but a higher gross margin using 71% from company-issued guidance.\n\nSo, how much distance is between my estimates and the analysts\u2019 estimates? Well, analysts are currently expecting $43.1 billion in revenue and 68.4% gross margin, while I anticipate at least $44.3 billion and 71% margins. The product of those numbers is the profit before subtracting Operating and Non-Operating Expenses, and dividing by shares outstanding.\n\n**I have $31.453 billion, while the analyst consensus is $29.48 billion, which is almost $2 billion lower.**\n\nEven if expenses come in higher than the company-issued guidance, analysts have sandbagged expectations going into the print. I expect a massive \u201csurprise\u201d beat on earnings day.\n\n**Most importantly, a large beat still may not be priced in, even after the pre-earnings rally. The stock is still around the same price it was going into last quarter\u2019s print. If we see QoQ earnings growth beating estimates, I believe investors will take the stock higher, while if this is all a pipe dream and earnings do decline, we could stay rangebound or worse.**\u00a0\n\n**As always, this is for educational purposes only and should not be taken as financial advice.**\u00a0",

(NVDA) Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang to ease restrictions on chip exports to the world\u2019s second largest economy.\n\n\u201cWe obviously have huge respect for Jensen,\u201d Sriram Krishnan, White House senior policy adviser for artificial intelligence, said in a Bloomberg Television interview Wednesday. \u201cWhen it comes to inside China, I do think there is still bipartisan and broad concern about what can happen to these GPUs once they\u2019re physically inside\u201d the country, he added.\n\nWhile the Trump administration still sees a security risk from widening AI chip exports to China, Krishnan said it agrees with Huang\u2019s view that restrictions on a wide range of other US trading partners need to be revisited. The Trump administration is rescinding and moving to replace the Biden-era AI diffusion rule that Krishnan said created \u201cGPU haves and GPU have nots.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to the rest of the world, we want American AI stack starting from the GPUs to the models to everything on top,\u201d Krishnan said. \u201cOn that, Jensen and I and us are in agreement.\u201d\n\nKrishnan spoke hours after Huang made his most forceful public comments to date against escalating US export restrictions aimed at China. Speaking at the Computex industry conference in Taipei, Huang blasted the measures as a \u201cfailure\u201d and urged the US to lower barriers to chip sales in China before American firms cede the market to rivals such as Huawei Technologies Co.\n\nHuang told reporters that China will account for a $50 billion opportunity in 2026. \u201cChina has 50% of the world\u2019s AI developers, and it\u2019s important that when they develop on an architecture, they develop on Nvidia, or at least American technology,\u201d he said. Nvidia recently wrote off $5.5 billion in H20 AI chips that had been designed to comply with previous export curbs, but were targeted by a new round of restrictions from the Trump administration this year.\n\nKrishnan pointed to the flurry of projects in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates announced by American companies during President Donald Trump\u2019s trip to the Middle East last week as evidence of a new effort to ease US allies\u2019 access to AI. He stressed that the agreements would still contain security restrictions to prevent the illegal transfer of advanced technology to China and other adversaries.\n\n\u201cThese deals and these GPUs are predominantly going to be run by American hyperscalers, American cloud service providers and American companies,\u201d said Krishnan, who was a general partner at venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz prior to joining the White House. \u201cMost of these GPUs are going to be run, hosted, controlled by American companies.\u201d",

    "title": "This market is disgustingly overpriced, and we are due for a correction similar to what we saw during Dot Com/Global financial crisis.",
    "selftext": "I want to preface this by stating that I legitimately home someone can refute what I have to say here. I take no pleasure in the thought of people's 401k's and IRA's and pension funds getting absolutely decimated, and this post has nothing to do with politics... I think the market has been overpriced for a long time (+/- 8 years), and it is only getting worse.\n\n**Some quick points:**\n\n**1. Price to earnings ratio**\n\nPrice to earnings ratio is at the point of absolute lunacy. The S&P 500 is over 28 today, and before the market started correcting in February, we were actually over 31. The Nasdaq is at 37 and was as high as 44. While I imagine most in this subreddit at least have a grasp of what P/E means -- for those that don't -- here's a quick summary. For purposes of this post, let's use NVDA as an example. Assume NVDA didn't have a single penny in expenses. They didn't have to pay for employees. They had no rent. There was no salary for Jensen Huang, and they didn't have to pay a penny in taxes. They somehow got all their electricity for free, and they didn't even have a COGS (cost of goods sold) -- somehow they were getting all of their materials for free. Then also assume that their sales remained exactly where they are at today... that their revenue remained identical to where it is at today, and they took 100% of that revenue, and distributed it back among the shareholders of the company. Right now -- NVDA's P/E is at 45.43 -- meaning it would be 45 years before investors recouped their money.\n\nThe entire S&P is trading over 28 today... meaning if the +/- 500 largest companies in the USA didn't have a single expense, and continued generating the same revenue, it would take 28 years for investors to get their money back.\n\nWho in the world would be interested in signing up for that \"investment\" opportunity? My own mother could call me asking me to invest in her company and I wouldn't invest based on that return.\n\n**2. The Buffett indicator**\n\nThe Buffett indicator is a simple calculation of the total value of the US stock market divided by GDP.\n\nHistorically, that number has hung out right around 1-- meaning the total value of the US stock market should be roughly the same as GDP. Buffett himself stated a value of 75-90% is reasonable, and a value over 120% signals the market is overpriced. The highest the buffett indicator has ever hit was during the dot com bubble, when it was 2.1 standard deviations above the trendline. The highest until now, that is. The market value is currently 211% of GDP, or almost 70% above what historically has been seen as normal.\n\n**3. The stock market is insanely top heavy.**\n\nThe Mag 7 currently account for 31% of the S&P 500, and over 40% of the Nasdaq. If these 7 stocks correct, it would be absolutely catastrophic for the market as a whole. We saw this play out during Dot Com with the likes of Cisco, Intel, and Oracle. While the market was top heavy then -- it was nowhere near as top heavy as it is today... In fact -- the top 10 most valuable companies now represent more than twice as much of a percentage of value in the market as the top 10 did when Dot Com crashed.\n\nSide note -- but I do think investors have briefly taken note of this. So much of these companies is based on perceived future growth based on revenue that can/will be generated by AI. But remember what happened when DeepSeek emerged last year -- and alerted WallStreet that an incredibly sophisticated AI can be created without pouring billions of dollars into R&D and infrastructure? The market absolutely tanked. What if it becomes obvious that these AI plays will not be unique to the largest tech companies in the world, and that these systems can be developed by any mid-cap with a decent budget?\n\n**4. Home prices and the Housing Market**\n\nI won't dive too deep into this, but homes are more unaffordable today than at any point in US history. Based on median US income and Median US home price, right before the Global financial crisis/mortgage crisis of 08/09 -- this number hit it's highest point in US history -- 45%.\n\nIts highest percent\u00a0*until*\u00a0the last 12 months. It now takes over 46% of a family's income to purchase a home.  \n30% is the figure that is generally regarded as affordable.\n\nThe condo market is collapsing, particularly in Florida, where HOA dues and Insurance costs have made these properties completely unaffordable.\n\nForeclosures on FHA loans are also set to resume. Biden put in place a policy where anyone that wanted could simply apply for a mortgage payment deferment after COVID... meaning call your servicer, say you're experiencing a hardship, and they simply give you a deferral. None of these homes could be foreclosed upon. They then tack these payments on to the back end of the loan with the additional accrued interest. This policy still exists today, but is about to come to an end in September. As of Q1 2025, over 10.6% of all FHA mortgages are at least one payment late. Over 4% of FHA mortgages are over 90 days late.\n\nWhat happens when FHA foreclosures absolutely flood the market?\n\nWhat does this do to home prices, and even more importantly, what does this do to homebuilders? If inventory skyrockets (more than it already has over the last couple of months), and price pressure pushes everything down due to increased supply, will home builders still be able to make money? Homebuilding employs over 11 million americans... Plumbers, electricians, roofers, landscapers, drywallers, framers, truck drivers, etc --\n\nWhen homes stop being built, unemployment skyrockets, and GDP shrinks dramatically.\n\n**5. Consumer debt is through the roof**\n\nCredit card debt is at the highest it's ever been, and delinquency rates are as high as they've been since emerging from the global financial crisis. Q4 of 2011 was the last time delinquency rates were this high.\n\nAuto loan delinquency rates are the highest they've been in decades.\n\n**6. Bonds -- worldwide -- are pushing higher and higher.**\n\nThe US is getting hit here worse than most, as it seems people are not excited about Trump's game of chicken with tariffs. Nonetheless -- you are seeing bond yields push higher and higher worldwide, as investors demand higher returns for government bonds to account for their perceived risk. Interest rates cuts have not quelled this. Despite 100bps cuts in the federal funds rate since last year, the 10 year t-note is actually up 80 ticks since then.\n\n**7. Commercial real estate**\n\nA massive amount of commercial real-estate will need to be refinanced in the coming 12-24 months -- and you will see these payments skyrocket. Many holders of Commercial real-estate refinanced their properties in the quarters after COVID, when interest rates were incredibly low. Most of these loans are either done on 5-year balloons, or as adjustable rate mortgages. These owners will see their payments jump by 30,50, even 70% as they are forced to refinance these properties and interest rates that are close to double what they were last time. This will be compounded by the fact that many companies moved to work from home models, or at least partial work from home models. Office space vacancy rates have skyrocketed -- meaning less tenants -- all while mortgage payments on these properties is skyrocketing.\n\n**8. Student Loan Debt**\n\nThe government's moratorium on student loan payments has officially come to an end. 43 million Americans that have been been able to avoid making payments on their average of $38k in student loan debt for the last 5+ years are now going to have to start making payments. Those that don't will see their credit score be absolutely decimated. What other payments will the begin to fall behind on?

The development comes after Britain and the United States signed a technology pact aimed at boosting ties in artificial intelligence and other fields. Founded in 2017, Wayve raised over $1 billion last year, led by SoftBank Group and supported by Nvidia. Ride-hailing platform Uber had also made a separate investment in the firm in 2024, for an undisclosed sum.\n\n> Wayve's technology, unlike conventional systems that rely on detailed digital maps and coding, uses machine learning with camera sensors mounted on the vehicles to learn from traffic patterns and driver behaviour. Its autonomous driving platforms have been powered by a partnership with Nvidia, whose chips are now bolstering a global AI boom. The London-based Wayve currently operates in Britain and the U.S. and has been expanding testing and development to wider markets like Germany and Japan.",

And now this comes out:   OPENAI, NVIDIA TO ANNOUNCE BILLIONS IN UK DATA CENTER PROJECTS\n\nSo that lands them in the realm of needing maybe $500+ billion in the next 4 years? They don\u2019t make money, they burn money, so it\u2019s not coming out of pocket. Maybe they go public and aim for a 1 trillion starting valuation? I know there are changes with their MSFT deal happening right now, not sure if listing is on the table. Or is the US government just giving them a blank check? None of these options seem overly likely.\n\n$ wise none of this adds up, and it\u2019s really starting to look like a giant scam to me. Yes ai has great uses, yes it is not going anywhere. But it\u2019s also not profitable, at all. Not even close. All of the mega caps are burning huge amounts of money getting this all set up, with the plan to monetize it down the road. META had its panic moment when they started overpaying to poach talent, probably because they realized that llm\u2019s hit a wall that would result in ai not being as profitable as projected. \n\nI think we may be in the stage where all companies start lying about future capex and revenue streams. At this point they have to. Just look at NVDA, renting back its own products lol, clever, but not actually a good thing. \n\nIf the mega caps admit they need to scale back the ai roll out or drastically extend the timelines to complete these data center projects, then bye bye stock price. But it is hard for public companies to just straight up lie. OpenAI has less public eyeballs on their books. Can they really afford all of this? They are saying they can, and ORCL had an amazing day thanks to that. So maybe that is the play now. As the music gets closer to stopping, we will see more and more projects get announced from OpenAI and possibly some of the other non-publicly traded ai companies. \n\nThese lies buy the industry time, which will allow the publicly traded companies to do offerings, maybe sell some stock, and just generally prepare for the coming market downturn. In turn, they agree to support the companies that are helping them fake these expansion / future revenue numbers right now. Because when the ball drops, and the capex bonfire is still burning hot, it\u2019s going to get ugly. \n\nWhen will this finally fall apart? Who knows. Maybe 3 months. Maybe 1 year. Maybe 2 years if the government drops rates to zero and hands out blank checks to all ai companies. But it will hit, and it won\u2019t be pretty. The warning signs are already showing. ",

NVIDIA\u2019s Blackwell Data Center revenue grew 17% sequentially.\n\nThere were no H20 sales to China-based customers in the second quarter.\u00a0NVIDIA benefited from a $180 million release of previously reserved H20 inventory, from approximately $650 million in unrestricted H20 sales to a customer outside of China.\n\nData Center revenue for the second quarter was $41.1 billion, up 56% from a year ago and up 5% sequentially. The strong year-on-year and sequential growth was driven by demand for our accelerated computing platform used for large language models, recommendation engines, and generative and agentic AI applications. We continue to ramp our Blackwell architecture, which grew 17% sequentially, including our newest architecture, Blackwell Ultra. We recognized Blackwell revenue across all customer categories, led by large cloud service providers, which represented approximately 50% of Data Center revenue.\n\nData Center compute revenue was $33.8 billion, up 50% from a year ago. Sequentially, compute revenue declined 1%, driven by a $4.0 billion reduction in H20 sales. Networking revenue was $7.3 billion, up 98% from a year ago and up 46% sequentially, driven by the growth of NVLink compute fabric for GB200 and GB300 systems, the ramp of XDR InfiniBand products, and adoption of Ethernet for AI solutions at cloud service providers and consumer internet companies.\n\n**Outlook**  \nNVIDIA\u2019s outlook for the third quarter of fiscal 2026 is as follows:\n\n* Revenue is expected to be $54.0 billion, plus or minus 2%. The company has not assumed any H20 shipments to China in the outlook.\n* GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 73.3% and 73.5%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. The company continues to expect to exit the year with non-GAAP gross margins in the mid-70% range.\n* GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $5.9 billion and $4.2 billion, respectively. Full year fiscal 2026 operating expense growth is expected to be in the high-30% range.\n* GAAP and non-GAAP other income and expense are expected to be an income of approximately $500 million, excluding gains and losses from non-marketable and publicly-held equity securities.\n* GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are expected to be 16.5%, plus or minus 1%, excluding any discrete items.",

    "selftext": "Nvidia reports earnings on Wednesday (Aug 27) after the close, and the setup looks like a textbook high-stakes event. The stock is currently trading at $181.30, up over 35% in the past three months, and the technicals tell a mixed story heading into earnings. On the positive side, the long-term trend is still strong. Nvidia is trading above its 10-day ($179), 50-day ($167), and 200-day ($137) moving averages, which confirms that the uptrend remains intact and the bulls are in control on a broader timeframe.\n\nHowever, the short-term signals show some cracks. The RSI sits at 73.4, which is firmly in overbought territory. To be clear, this doesn\u2019t always mean the stock will drop immediately, but it does raise the probability of profit-taking in the near term. The MACD has slipped below the signal line (2.92 vs. 4.43), and the histogram has been shrinking since mid-August, indicating fading momentum. Volume has also flatlined while price continued to rise, often a sign that buyers are running out of steam ahead of a major catalyst.\n\nHistorically, Nvidia tends to move around \u00b18% after its earnings announcements. Given the massive run it\u2019s already had this quarter, the risk/reward skews toward the downside. Yes, if Nvidia beats expectations and raises guidance, the stock could break through $190\u2013200 and extend its rally. But with RSI overbought, MACD momentum weakening, and volume drying up, there\u2019s also a real chance of a \u201csell the news\u201d reaction back toward $170 to 160, even on solid earnings.\n\nTLDR: The long-term trend remains bullish, but in the short-term, Nvidia is priced for perfection. Technicals suggest momentum is tiring, so investors should be prepared for volatility and not be surprised if the first reaction is red before the next leg higher.",

News hit AH yesterday, ultimately interested to see if INTC makes another run at the open and if we can sustain- we've made a massive 6% move already. Despite the bearish news of  US government potentially using CHIPS Act grants to buy equity in the company, SoftBank news seems purely bullish until we get more details. This hasn't moved other semis much (NVDA/AMD unaffected). Thank you Nana!!!\n\n[**OPEN (Open Door)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=OPEN&p=d)\\-Carrie Wheeler resigned as chair and CEO and the board launched a search for her replacement. This has caused the stock to explode from $2.50 -> $4. Again, this has meme stock written all over it. Not too interested in any long-term plays, but interested in seeing if we can break $5 again. Currently short-biased.  Personally, I don't think this can make any kind of sustainable move because it's way too liquid to make any of those epic squeezes we've seen from other companies in the past- illiquidity is what drives the massive moves when people get squeezed. \n\n[**VKTX (Viking Therapeutics)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=VKTX&p=d)\\-Its experimental obesity pill disappointed in a mid-stage study, marking another weaker-than-expected result for an oral alternative to popular weight-loss injections. \"VK2735, helped patients lose up to 12.2% of their body weight. However, roughly 28% of patients dropped out of the trial in just three months, dampening hopes that the pill could compete with treatments from LLY/NVO.\" Had an epic spike to the upside then sold off close to 35%-mainly looking for a bounce in this stock if we reach $25 again.\n\n[**APLD (**Applied Digital Corp**)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=APLD&p=d)\\-Announced they were breaking ground on Polaris Forge 2 - a $3B, 280MW AI factory in North Dakota. Cited \"unprecedented demand for AI compute infrastructure\". Interestingly enough, Sam Altman said yesterday that investors were \"overexcited about AI\".\n\nAnyway, this stock has near doubled in the past 3 months and I'm interested to see if we can hold above $16.

    "selftext": "APLD is positioning themselves as one of the few players building the kind of high-performance data centers that AI workloads actually demand. We're talking racks stacked with GPU's pulling power at a massive scale.\n\nOn paper, they've got around 400MW scheduled to come online nby 2027. That's just what's already been announced. Management has been clear that if they can line up more power, they'll keep scaling aggressively. And when you run the numbers, the revenue potential starts looking pretty wild.\n\nHere's the simple math: industry rates for high-performance hosting earn about $.35 to $.50 per watt per month, with AI workloads usually toward the higher end. Annualied that's $6,000 per kW, or $6M per MW. Multiply that by 400 MW and you're looking at roughly $2.4B in yearly revenue potential.\n\nEven if you haircut that for more conservative assumptions- say $.40/watt and a 45% margin - it still works out to a business throwing off serious cash. Data center operators at scale tend to run 50% EBITDA margins, so $2.4B in revenue would translate into \\~1.2B in EBITDA. And right now the market is valuing infrastructure names feeding the AI boom at 10-20x EBITDA. That points to a market cap anywhere from $12B on the low end to north of $20B if they execute well.\n\nThe bigger lever, though, is capacity. If they can find another 200-300 MW to build out on top of the 400 MW roadmap, the earnings power scales dramatically. The real bottleneck here isn't GPUs - it's electricity. APLD's edge is that their sites are in power-friendly locations where expansion is actually possible.\n\nI originally came across this stock while doing some modeling work on NVDA for a client. CoreWeave, which NVDA owns a stake in, cut a deal with APLD not long ago - and the stock ripped up 50%. APLD is essentially a landlord,\u00a0and companies like CoreWeave are the tenants, leasing AI power.\n\nLet me know your guys thoughts.",

    "title": "CENTENE (CNC) is a good long term opportunity at this level",
    "selftext": "Like every self-respecting Value investor, I've been looking for opportunities to divest from my tech-heavy portfolio. AI Stocks like NVDA, PLTR, MSFT, AMZN, TSLA have done great, but some of these valuations just don't make sense and I don't think now is a good time to buy into them anymore.\n\nThat brings me to look for other opportunities. I don't think there's a better opportunity right now than the Healthcare sector.\n\nHistorically, Healthcare has outperformed the S&P, thanks to relatively stable stocks like CNC.\n\nLet's take a step back. What the f\\*%# happened to this stock in the past 2 months ?\n\nThey came out and :\n\n1. Said that their Medical Loss Ratio(MLR) will be much higher because claims are getting expensive\n2. Pulled guidance for 2025\n\nSince then, they've had their Q2 Earnings call. They've revised guidance to a EPS of 1.75 for 2025 (from 7.5 previously, ouch). Given that their Q1 2025 EPS was 2.9, and their Q2 EPS was -0.16, this is pricing in a combined -1$ EPS for Q3 and Q4.\n\nThe bar is very low. Even a small sign of life from the CEO, could send this stock easily back to the 40 - 50 range, as a path to profitability is starting to be priced into the stock.\n\nThe recent headwind, albeit very impactful in the short to medium-term, is temporary. the CEO has said that they have already completed rate re-filings in the 29 states by now, and that the rate decision for each states will be expected in September. The new rates that determine the amount of premiums received, will take into account the high cost for behavioral health(therapists, psychiatric meds etc...),  home health services, and expensive drugs (Wegovy, Ozempic...) .\n\nCompared to the giant UNH, CNC has a much better reputation, isn't under DOJ Investigation, and Ambetter, their Health Insurance Marketplace, has a claims denial rate of 14%, more than half that of UNH.\n\n# Path back to profitability :\n\nCEO and the team are now laser focused on restoring profitability by pulling the necessary levers :\n\n\\- identifying and reducing areas where claims have been too \"costly\"\n\n\\- increasing premium rates, to account for the challenging environment, and with a worst case scenario in mind (continued high morbidity and utilization rate)\n\n\\- hinting at a stock buyback in the Earnings call\n\n\\- Immune from tariff BS and TACO\n\n# Possible risks\n\n\\- The trend of high morbidity and drug use continues to escalate, leading to more people needing expensive surgeries and drugs ==> unlikely, as people who fear that their benefits are being taken away with OBBBA, have already stocked up on drugs/done surgeries\n\n\\- continued political pressure on healthcare costs with bills like the OBBBA ==> unlikely, as this bill seems to be a one-and-done on healthcare, and now the Administration will focus on other more pressing matters (Russia - Ukraine conflict, Inflation, crypto, tax bills for the rich etc ...).\n\nAlso, this is speculation, but I think the full impact of the OBBBA are wayyy overstated. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that by 2034, 16 million people will lose coverage, but that's a decade away. This will be accounted for in the rate re-pricing.\n\n\\- Risks of people changing Insurers because of higher rates ==> given that every Health insurer will be increasing rates, among them: Elevance, UNH, Molina, Blue Cross Blue Shield, CNC will be no exception. People won't switch because none of the other options are better. Centene's health plan is pretty competitive, and compared to Molina health who's the most affordable, Centene's has much better coverage(available across 29 states vs 8 for Molina)\n\nOverall, I think this is a compelling buy, not just for CNC, but for the Health care sector overall, as the benefits greatly outweigh the risk at this point. Historically, the Healthcare Sector has outperformed the S&P, and this is the perfect time to buy in.",

Here\u2019s how I see it: AI needs constant computational and electrical power. Not just for the data centers and the fabs that make the chips, but the chips themselves burn power 24/7. The more models scale, the more energy they eat. That power has to come from somewhere. Big tech ceos are already talking about potential future power shortages if we dont come up with something better than what we have rn\nSo here\u2019s how I\u2019m thinking about it:\nWe started with AI companies throwing money at chip companies \u2192chip companies throwing money at fabs like TSMC \u2192fabs and AI centers pulling insane amounts of power off the grid \u2192and now we\u2019re about to see power companies (especially nuclear) get flooded with cash \u2192and that means the uranium miners feeding those reactors are next in line.\nThis is how i see the chain:\nAI companies \u2192 NVDA / AMD / INTC \u2192 TSMC / Samsung \u2192 SMRs like Oklo / SMR / TerraPower \u2192 uranium miners like UUUU / NXE / CCJ.\nEvery stage up the chain got paid. The last ones left to run are nuclear and uranium.\nI think we\u2019re about to see a repeat of the same pattern within the next few years as we experience energy shortage. Just like how NVDA and AMD dominated chips, I think a couple players will dominate nuclear. Right now we\u2019ve got:\n* Oklo (backed by Sam Altman, just IPO\u2019d $10.5B)\n* NuScale / SMR (~$6.8B)\n* TerraPower (still private but Gates-backed and getting a ton of attention)\nThat\u2019s probably the big 3. Others will show up, but like everything else, a couple names are going to take 80% of the market and leave everyone else behind.\nSame goes for uranium. CCJ is the king, but NXE and UUUU are getting attention. Supply is tight, and if nuclear demand explodes, miners get squeezed upward just like GPU demand squeezed NVDA.\nSo yeah, are Oklo / SMR / TerraPower are the next NVDA / AMD / INTC  just further up the chain? The ones getting paid by the ones getting paid.\nI\u2019m looking at LEAP calls and they are not that expensive while they\u2019re still under the radar. It\u2019s the last piece of the AI/infrastructure puzzle that hasn\u2019t run yet.\nWhat do you guys think? Am I early? I just dropped a few grand on $UUUU and OKLO july 2026 calls so Im seaking guidance from fellow degenerates. Also I know were still years ahead of nuclear, but I have a big FOMO\u2026",

Not clear if there is a home run, but I think a smart person could figure out a smart way to play this.\n\nUnfortunately, I'm not a smart person, but maybe collectively as a group of not-smart people, we can figure out some plays here.\n\nI can't link sources for some reason, keeps deleting my post, but you guys can google more information regarding the event if you want. TLDR It's being hosted\n\nTechnology leaders participating in the event include **Chris Power, CEO of Hadrian**; **Shyam Sankar, CTO of Palantir**; **Paul Buchheit, Partner at YCombinator; James Litinsky, CEO of MP Materials; Lisa Su, CEO of AMD.**\n\nAdditional speakers are still being confirmed.\n\nI don't think the obvious choices are going to move much here. NVDA is already up significantly and i don't expect any announcements big enough to move a 4 trillion market cap... The easing of chip restrictions is also already priced in now. I expected this will be touched on at the event, but it's no longer news.\n\nSpitballing but a few ideas:\n\nI think energy will be a major focus of any strategy announcement. This is an area that is critically important for AI, and an area where the US is SIGNIFICANTLY lagging China. I'm not too sure how this could be played, but I'm considering EQT. I was looking at them last week due to the PA AI event. The stock didn't move much unfortunately, but all of nat gas seems to have struggled to close the week for whatever reason. By no means an expert here, but EQT has a major grift angle in that their CEO is closely tied to the republican party/trump.\n\nDatacenter buildout: PWR, ACM, FLR - not really sure here. Chatgpt helped me on this one. Maybe APLD? Could be some type of policy/tax incentive to stimulate datacenter construction. not that its really needed at this point...\n\nI'm really just spitballing and hoping to start some conversation here.",

    "title": "Nvidia Will Continue Controlling The AI Board",
    "selftext": "Nvidia is the 'queen' of the AI ecosystem, dominating hardware, software, and systems and controlling key segments from training to inference and networking.\n\nUnmatched AI leadership, explosive revenue growth, and strategic partnerships with players like Astera Labs, Credo, and Super Micro Computer reinforce Nvidia's central role.\n\nChina market access and the Omniverse platform provide significant new growth drivers, supporting a strong 12-24 month growth outlook and a buy rating.\n\nDespite high absolute valuation multiples, Nvidia's rapid growth and favorable PEG ratios make it attractive versus peers; the main risk is US-China geopolitical tension.\n\nI believe these companies are well-positioned in the AI ecosystem, but I realise that one piece is missing: the queen. Just like in a game of chess, the queen is the most powerful and versatile piece on the board. It can move in any direction (horizontal, vertical, and diagonal) and quickly cover a wide area. That is why I believe it is a perfect fit for NVIDIA (NVDA). I say this because it dominates both offensively and defensively. Just as the queen controls most of the board, NVDA controls the most valuable parts of the AI infrastructure, from training to inference, simulation, and networking. Secondly, it is versatile and critical because it spans hardware, software, and systems. This is cool because few participants can match its breadth and influence. Finally, it leverages strategic partnerships. I mean, just as the queen commands pawns, rooks, and bishops, NVDA integrates system builders (such as Super Micro Computer (SMCI)), connectivity providers (such as Credo Technology Group (CRDO) and Astera Labs (ALAB)), and government AI programmes to expand its control over the AI battlefield.\n\nSo why is the queen so special?\n\nWell, several factors set Nvidia apart. First and foremost, it holds an unparalleled leadership position in the AI field, thanks to the combination of hardware, software, and ecosystem advantages. Its Blackwell GPU architecture makes it uniquely special. Combined with the Omniverse simulation platform, we are driving self-reinforcing AI, which is driving explosive growth. For example, in the first quarter of the 2026 fiscal year, NVDA achieved revenue of $44.1 billion, representing a year over year increase of 69%. Data centre revenue reached $39.1 billion, up 73%. Some of Nvidia's key customers such as Microsoft , Google  OpenAI, and Meta  deploy tens of thousands of Nvidia's latest GPUs each quarter. For example, according to SA Weebler Finance data, hyperscale data centre operators are running approximately 1,000 NVLink rack systems (about 72,000 GPUs) per week, with further increases expected. Ideally, this means Nvidia's data centre run rate in the AI computing sector has exceeded $170 billion annually.\n\nSecondly, NVDA's stack is also expanding beyond GPUs. As I mentioned, its global industrial simulation platform is now being used to digitise entire factories and cities. In fact, the platform has evolved to support critical infrastructure. Original equipment manufacturers like BMW are running over 30 virtual factories on the platform to optimise production in advance. As each AI solution requires an increasing amount of synthetic training data, NVDA's end-to-end solutions form an unparalleled moat. Ideally, this platform means more users generating more simulation data, ultimately driving demand for more Nvidia computing resources. What I see is that NVDA is now at the centre of the AI value chain.\n\nFinally, the U.S. has approved the resumption of exports of NVIDIA H20 AI GPUs to China. This means NVIDIA will be able to access China's potential market, which is significant. According to a Morgan Stanley report, China's AI market is expected to reach $1.4 trillion by 2030.\n\nChina has been systematically implementing a long-term strategy to build its domestic artificial intelligence capabilities. Its strong academic foundation, innovative methods, data, talent, and growing foreign investment are driving it toward becoming a leading artificial intelligence powerhouse...\n\n\u2018...China is less concerned with building the most powerful AI capabilities and more focused on bringing AI to market. China embraces open-source AI, while the United States appears to be moving toward closed, tightly controlled AI systems...\u2019\n\n\u2018...The next 6 to 12 months will be a critical period for Chinese AI companies, as more and more deployments aimed at solving real-world problems begin to demonstrate productivity gains.\u2019\n\nDue to this milestone, NVDA's Jensen Huang estimates that NVDA's potential market size  in China will reach $50 billion. This means that China's spending on AI will increase, and Nvidia's growth prospects are expected to be stronger than ever before. I expect this growth outlook to be reflected in the upcoming quarterly earnings report to be released on 27 August 2025.\n\nThese factors combined will undoubtedly accelerate Nvidia's growth trajectory over the next 12 to 24 months. Therefore, I assign a \u2018Buy\u2019 rating to Nvidia Corporation.\n\nNvidia's AI Ecosystem\n\nHaving highlighted the case for NVDA, I would like to connect it to some AI components I have researched previously. Some of these AI companies have remarkable growth prospects and are expected to align their growth trajectories with NVDA. Additionally, the connections between NVDA and these AI companies will help us better understand NVDA's future direction.\n\nFirst, Astera Labs  is a leading connectivity chip company that recently went public in 2024. ALAB's chips support scalable and low-latency GPU rack interconnects. For more information on Astera Labs and its chips, please refer to Article 1 and Article 2. Now, Nvidia has publicly announced its collaboration with Astera on NVLink Fusion. This collaboration expands NVDA's total addressable market (TAM).\n\nThere is also Credo Technology, which is known for its active cables  re-timers, and SerDes chips. According to SA Oakoff Investments, most hyperscale computing vendors now consider CRDO's AEC to be the de facto standard for in-rack links. This means that AEC cables are the infrastructure required for NVDA's 72-GPU Blackwell rack.\n\nThird, Super Micro Computer  and Celestica  manufacture and sell GPU racks and systems using NVDA technology. Nvidia currently provides complete data centre racks containing tens of thousands of GPUs, which are delivered to system builders like SMCI and CLS. They then collaborate with NVDA to package and sell these racks to hyperscale customers such as Microsoft, Meta, and Amazon. For more information, please refer to this article from SMCI and this article from Celestica.\n\nIn summary, these partnerships demonstrate NVIDIA's connectivity within the AI ecosystem. This confirms that NVIDIA is indeed the queen of the AI chessboard.\n\nFor a company with a market capitalisation of 4.22 trillion dollars, it still has significant growth opportunities, particularly in the Chinese market, which means there is much to watch for with NVIDIA. Additionally, I note that NVIDIA has an A- growth rating, as shown in the figure below. The company's expected revenue growth rate is 60.71%, while the industry median is 7.28%. Furthermore, its 3-5 year compound annual growth rate  for expected long-term earnings per share  growth is 29.09%, compared to the industry median of 14.29%. This clearly indicates the expected growth levels for certain potential AI opportunities, such as the Omniverse platform and the Chinese AI market.\n\nNow, when it comes to valuation, the growth outlook is becoming clearer. First, when I look at the chart below, I notice that most metrics are above the industry median, indicating that the valuation is higher than the industry median. Its non-GAAP forward price-to-earnings ratio is 40.12 times, and its forward enterprise value to EBITDA ratio is 34.79 times, both significantly higher than the industry median. However, when I look at the non-GAAP forward price-to-earnings ratio , it indicates that the valuation is undervalued by 27%. NVDA's price-to-earnings ratio is 1.38 times, while the industry median is 1.90 times. Based on the GAAP trailing 12-month PEG, the company's P/E ratio is 0.69 times, undervalued by 31% compared to the industry median. Ideally, I would say that most multiples look high in absolute terms, but compared to NVDA's 60.71% compound annual growth rate, the stock's valuation isn't as high as it appears.\n\nIn terms of peer comparison, I chose NVDA's closest competitors because Nvidia is already far ahead in terms of market capitalisation, so I chose Broadcom and AMD. I noticed that NVDA's price-to-earnings ratio and expected price-to-earnings ratio are still lower than its peers.\n\nI believe that the biggest risk facing NVIDIA at present is geopolitical risk. Currently, there are many uncertainties between China and the United States, especially following the imposition of tariffs on Liberation Day and the U.S. government's decision to suspend exports of H20 GPUs to China. Such situations could recur and undermine NVIDIA's growth plans and market expansion efforts. Losing the Chinese market would have a significant impact on NVIDIA's business. Additionally, geopolitical events such as trade tariffs and sanctions could affect global supply or cloud computing spending in some of the key regions where NVIDIA operates. In conclusion, in this grand AI infrastructure game, NVIDIA is the queen. Currently, it is the most powerful and flexible piece on the board. Compared to peers that may occupy other key positions, NVIDIA controls every direction. For example, AMD is the rook, SMCI is the bishop, while Credo and Astera are agile knights. Ultimately, NVIDIA determines the pace and scope of this game. As AI demand continues to grow, NVIDIA's dominant position is further strengthened by the expansion of the Chinese market.",

Nasdaq futures rose less than 0.1%, essentially flat.\n\nTrump has harshly criticized Powell and his Fed colleagues for the decision to stand pat on interest rates at a time when the economy is broadly healthy and unemployment is low. Trump's new complaint about Powell  which he says could be grounds for firing the central bank chief  is about cost overruns on the $2.5 billion renovation project at the Fed's Washington headquarters.\n\nWall Street loves lower rates because they goose prices higher for stocks and other investments, and Trump himself has been clamoring for the Fed to cut more quickly. But Powell has insisted he wants to wait for more data about how Trump\u2019s stiff tariffs will affect the economy and inflation.\n\nMarkets, as well as the dollar, took a quick dive Wednesday on reports that Trump was talking about terminating Powell, but largely recovered after he appeared to walk back those sentiments.\n\nA number of companies early in the earnings season have been reporting strong performances, even as they cite uncertainty about the near future due to the potential impacts of Trump's tariffs.\n\nPepsiCo shares rose 2% before the bell Thursday after the beverage and snack giant's second-quarter sales and profit topped Wall Street projections. PepsiCo reaffirmed its April guidance, which projected lower full-year profit than previous forecasts due to increased costs from tariffs and a pullback in consumer spending.\n\nThe world\u2019s largest chipmaker, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.

This benefits high-end chipmakers, namely AMD/NVDA the most.\n\n[**BABA (Alibaba)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=BABA&p=d)/KC/FXI/all Chinese stocks- The chip export announcement has been interpreted as Trump easing his stance on China, sparking a rally across most Chinese equities. BABA was up nearly 6% premarket, and I'm mainly interested in seeing if we can break daily highs in BABA today, other than that I'm also watching KC, a Chinese datacenter stock. Main risk is that Trump reverses his stance- the TACO trade can cut both ways.\n\n[**MP (MP Materials)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=MP&p=d)\\- The Department of Defense agreed to buy $400M in MP's newly issued preferred stock, taking a 15% stake in the company last week. AAPL is expected to announce a $500M commitment to MP, signaling \"deepening partnerships to localize critical rare-earth supply chains\" (this was announced on FOX news). I doubt this will make as big a spike as the DOD investment because we're so far up already, so not too interested in this stock today, but still worth writing about.",

    "selftext": "The \u2018elephant in the room\u2019 for Palantir Technologies is its expected P/E of over 200x and market cap of over 100x sales, reflecting expectations of accelerated growth. Is the market forecast correct?\n\nPalantir's unique position at the AI application layer, proven scalability, and fit with Western values justify its high valuation by making it a potential $1 trillion company.\n\nUsing Microsoft as a benchmark, Palantir would need $90bn in revenue, $68bn in gross profit, $23bn in free cash flow and a 40.3% compound annual growth rate in revenue to become a $1 trillion company.\n\nPalantir's first quarter 2025 revenue growth rate of 39% is in line with the required 40.3% CAGR, and the US commercial revenue growth rate (71% year-over-year) suggests a potential acceleration to 70% by 2026.\n\nVolatility is to be expected, and those who are sceptical about AI should avoid PLTR stocks. I have been following Palantir Technologies Inc since May 2024 and recommend it as a strong buy given its unique positioning in AI (personal view)\n\nPalantir has a unique competitive advantage in the \u2018application layer\u2019 of AI, i.e. in the systems That is, in the user-facing part of the system, AI functionality can be accessed and used through specific applications.\n\nPalantir has proven that its solutions can deliver real value to business customers and governments. More importantly, it has demonstrated the scalability of its business - as evidenced by its impressive Rule of 40 numbers.\n\nBeing a founder-led company with a nearly two-decade history in the U.S. military and government sectors is another competitive advantage for Palantir. The company has positioned itself politically as a strong supporter of Western values and an important military supplier in the age of AI.\n\nGiven these factors, Palantir is uniquely positioned to benefit from the acceleration of the AI race as AI applications (and their growth) shift from GPU vendors to agent-based AI and robotics. In short, Palantir is one of the few, if not the only, company that can play a central role in global workforce automation.\n\nRecently, with Palantir's recent record highs, I wanted to focus on something else that is like an \u2018elephant in the room\u2019 for anyone considering taking a stake in Palantir: its high valuation.\n\nWhat does the market see that you don't?\n\nWhen I started covering Palantir, critics pointed to the company's inability to scale its business (Palantir was glorified as a \u2018consulting firm\u2019) and its questionable addressable market in AI (which some still see as a passing fad or bubble).\n\nToday, those who are bearish on Palantir tend to acknowledge that the company is truly unique, but the criticism focuses on its valuation. To be clear, I fully understand those who are concerned when they see its expected P/E ratio exceeding 200x and its market cap exceeding 100x sales.Palantir's valuation is indeed high.\n\nHowever, when I evaluate a stock, I always ask myself the same question: what does the market think about a company to give it such a high valuation?\n\nI think the market is accelerating, fuelled by the AI race. A fundamental question investors should ask themselves is: Does Palantir have what it takes to be a $1 trillion company?\n\nIf the answer is yes, then the upside is about 3x relative to today's valuation.\n\nTo me, it's clear that the market believes this is a new Mag 7 company on the rise, and that's why it's giving PLTR such a high valuation, regardless of its accelerating growth.\n\nIn the next section, I will analyse what it will take for Palantir to grow into a $1 trillion market cap company. Feel free to judge for yourself whether this is realistic. If it is realistic, then I think long-term investors should be able to accept Palantir's current high valuation, which still represents a significant discount relative to the company's long-term trajectory.\n\nWhat would a $1 trillion Palantir look like?\n\nNot all companies with a $1 trillion market cap trade at the same valuation. In order to figure out what a $1 trillion market cap Palantir would actually look like, I would first find a reference company to compare it to. That's not easy because there are only about a dozen companies with a market cap of more than $1 trillion globally, and some of them are in completely different sectors, such as energy.\n\nMy company of choice is Microsoft. I think it is the closest to Palantir in terms of business, as most of its business is geared towards B2B customers and selling software solutions to them. Its business model is also partially similar to Palantir's in that it \u2018locks in\u2019 enterprise customers with hard-to-migrate software such as Microsoft Windows or Microsoft Office. Finally, Microsoft itself is a strong AI company with a high (albeit more reasonable) valuation. Is this likely to happen? My take on the AI race\n\nPalantir's 39% year-over-year growth rate through the first quarter of 2025 is roughly in line with my assumptions for the above scenario, which could value the company at $1 trillion. Of course, I don't expect Palantir to really maintain a perfect 40%-ish growth rate for 10 years and then suddenly drop to 5%. I expect Palantir to accelerate its growth over the next few quarters and then eventually slow down.\n\nIn this context, it's worth noting that Palantir's overall revenue growth has historically lagged U.S. commercial revenue. For example, in the first quarter of 2024, U.S. commercial revenues grew 40% year-over-year, while total revenues grew 21%. One year later (Q1 2025), total revenues are roughly at the same level as commercial revenues a year ago (39% vs. 40%), while U.S. commercial revenues are now growing at 71% year-over-year.\n\nI think the market has taken note of this trend and now expects Palantir's total revenue growth rate to accelerate from 40% to roughly 70% (on par with U.S. commercial revenues) by the beginning of 2026.Palantir may achieve this by the first quarter of 2026, later in 2026, or not at all. Market volatility is to be expected. Obviously, I expect the market to react differently in each case - in my view, adjustments will only be made if the growth rate does not match the expected acceleration.\n\nPalantir's success in becoming a trillion-dollar company will ultimately depend on whether the AI race provides Palantir with enough potential markets to accelerate its growth.\n\nA detailed discussion of the entire AI race is beyond the scope of this article. In short, I am personally very bullish on AI and I think we are at the beginning of a new industrial revolution. I believe that over the next few quarters we will see continued demand for GPUs and microchips translate into accelerated demand for cloud solutions and AI application layer solutions, which will benefit Palantir greatly.NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA), a leading manufacturer of \u2018key components\u2019 (GPUs) in the AI race, was one of the early beneficiaries of AI. The company has managed to grow its total revenue from just over $5bn in 2016 to $148bn. This equates to a staggering 46% compound annual growth rate over nine years, which is roughly in line with my model of how Palantir will grow to a $1 trillion valuation.\n\nPersonally, I think Palantir can replicate Nvidia's success over the next 10 years as the AI race rapidly shifts from hardware to new software applications.\n\nThat's why I don't think Palantir is currently overvalued. The market is simply more forward-looking than it has been in the past. Instead, I see \\~3x upside from its current valuation, and I maintain my medium-term price target of $250 per share (consistent with my past research), which is based on its five-year CAGR of \\~30% and an investment horizon of 2030. To be clear, I do believe that Palantir will eventually be valued at $1 trillion, and I expect to reassess my price target in the future. Needless to say, those readers who remain sceptical about AI and believe it is a bubble destined to burst would do well to steer clear of Palantir and, as I stated in the previous section, the bullish case for Palantir at its current price is only valid if the AI race accelerates. That is the fundamental risk of entering Palantir at this time.\n\nAnother key risk is volatility. With the market's current growth expectations for the company so high, its shares are likely to pull back sharply on even the slightest sign of weakness. In my view, Palantir is not only on track to meet its earnings guidance in the coming quarters, but it is also expected to consistently beat guidance and begin to show accelerated growth - possibly in line with its U.S. commercial sector's growth rate (70%) in the first quarter.\n\nEven if the company eventually evolves into a new \u2018Mag 7\u2019 giant, adjustments and volatility are likely. No company is immune to poor results, and investors should be wary of Palantir's potential exposure to rapid changes in market sentiment in the future. In my opinion, anyone not comfortable with high volatility should avoid this stock.\n\nConclusion\n\nAt first glance, Palantir's valuation seems unsustainable. However, the market is always forward looking and if all it took to be a good investor was to read the P/E ratio, then we could all be Warren Buffett. The key question investors should be thinking about when analysing Palantir is: what is the market seeing beyond the numbers of the last few quarters?\n\nPersonally, I think the market is witnessing a company with a $1 trillion valuation. Overall revenue growth in the first quarter of 2025 (39%) is comparable to the growth in U.S. commercial sales a year ago (40% in the first quarter of 2024). I believe the market now expects this trend to continue, with Palantir growing at 70% of the level of U.S. commercial revenues in the first quarter of 2025.\n\nMoving towards $1 trillion is achievable in my view. palantir needs to grow at a CAGR of about 40% over the next 10 years, slightly less than NVIDIA's 2016 year-to-date growth rate. In my view, Palantir is uniquely positioned in the AI \u2018application layer\u2019 and I believe it can achieve this goal.\n\nA $1 trillion valuation implies about 3x upside from current price levels. Therefore, net of short-term volatility, I believe Palantir remains undervalued. While I maintain my five-year price target of $250 per share, if the company continues to perform as well as it has in the past, I expect to buy on the downside\n\nPersonally, I believe the market is witnessing a company valued at $1 trillion. Overall revenue growth in Q1 2025 (39%) is comparable to the growth in U.S. commercial sales a year ago (40% in Q1 2024).

In my view, Palantir is uniquely positioned in the AI \u2018application layer\u2019 and I believe it can achieve this goal.A $1 trillion valuation implies about 3x upside from current price levels. Therefore, net of short-term volatility, I believe Palantir remains undervalued. While I maintain my five-year price target of $250 per share",

On Monday, analysts from Morgan Stanley said in a research note that potential usage of Google's chips for inferencing OpenAI's AI workloads would have been a significant endorsement of Google's hardware.\n\nOver the weekend, it was reported that OpenAI has started using Google-made AI chips to build its products. However, it was noted that Google was not providing the most powerful TPUs to OpenAI, signaling its plans to use its most advanced versions to power the company's internal projects, including its own large language model Gemini.\n\nLast month, OpenAI, reportedly, signed a deal with Google Cloud for the AI company's computing needs.",

    "selftext": "I know when a company is at a bargain to buy. Problem is, I know when to buy, but I don\u2019t know when to sell. Do I sell when I need the money or when doctor tells me I only got a month to live? \n\nLet me give you several examples:\n\nI was able to buy lots of Celsius stocks at $8 basis in 2020 when I began trying their drinks, enjoyed it and began seeing Celsius drinks sold everywhere at grocery markets and convenience stores. I felt confident. Celsius rose all the way to $95, the stock split and dropped all the way back to $25. Obviously, I did not sell any.\n\nSame thing applies to FSLY, SQ, SE when I did not sell at the peak and watched them drop all the way back to my entry price then I panic sold and only secured a very little gain.\n\nSMCI - I also panic sold at $23.81 for small gain and obviously, watching the price going back up is lots of pain. \n\nI was able to buy lots of crowdstrike last year in July when the outage caused chaos within airport and various companies. I also scooped some UNH as well due to recent (to me, it\u2019s overreaction) free fall. \n\nI bought lots of ASTS at $11 and sold at $30 to get my entry money back. Then it went all the way to $46. \n\nLots of people say, if a stock gives you 25% to 50%, it makes sense for you to sell all, take the profit and run. It\u2019s not true at all. If you sold NVDA, TSLA, AMD and PLTR at 30% gain, you probably cried yourself to sleep every night. Some of the companies do have ten-fold potential if you decide to hold long. And selling them also subject yourself to short term capital gain tax. \n\nAlso, PLTR PE ratio skyrockets. I understand military contract and AI reliance are legit, but there\u2019s no guarantee for price to hold. When is a good time to sell? Which companies have bright future to hold strong despite free fall? Nobody has a crystal ball I understand but does reading business financial statement and learning their fundamental/ business model/ ecological system gives you a clue? \n\nMarket is at ATH carried by major techs due to AI replacing humans leading to boost in company\u2019s profit margin and future earning potential. But correction will eventually come. \n\nI need investing veterans to give me some guidances here? Appreciate it!! \n\nWarren Buffett once said \u201cselling fine businesses on scary news is usually a bad decision\u201d ",

    "selftext": "Nvidia is at the centre of the AI revolution, with breakthrough products and great opportunities ahead that continue to exceed my expectations.\n\nRecent innovations such as the Blackwell GB200 NVL72 and expanding AI applications, including robotics, solidify Nvidia's dominant market position and growth potential.\n\nDespite a record valuation, Nvidia's history of growing profits at a rate above valuation is unlikely to end.\n\nI remain a committed long-term buyer of NVDA and I believe that Nvidia's leadership in AI and data centre technology makes it a must-have stock, despite the short-term risks.\n\nHow about now? NVIDIA's stock price and valuation just hit an all-time high, and many investors are wondering if NVIDIA is overvalued. Maybe they should take profits? Surely we'll see some short sellers active. For me, the journey has just begun. Since my recent article NVIDIA has announced some significant partnerships and at the recent GTC Paris conference its CEO made it clear to me that the growth story behind AI is continuing to accelerate. Let me bring you up to speed while we review whether NVIDIA remains a worthwhile buying opportunity.\n\nIt's worth noting that the US or Asia aren't the only ones committed to AI development - Europe is also active and not far behind. While Europe isn't often mentioned in these discussions (there's even a joke that the US owns AI while Europe has an \u2018AI Act\u2019 to regulate it), NVIDIA has highlighted its involvement in industrial/physical AI From the heart of Germany's automotive industry to the manufacturing hubs of France and Italy, Europe is adopting industrial AI and advanced AI robotics to address labour shortages, increase productivity and drive sustainable economic growth.\n\nRobotics companies are developing humanoid robots and collaborative systems to integrate AI into real-world manufacturing applications. Backed by a $200bn investment programme and a coordinated effort by the European Commission, Europe is at the forefront of the next wave of AI-driven industrial automation.\n\nIt's easy to get caught up in concerns about potential overvaluation once the stock hits another record high. Take a look at NVDA's P/E ratio trend (I usually focus on EV/EBITDA, but it's showing the same trend). Since April 2025, the P/E has risen significantly as valuations have experienced a dynamic recovery (over 50%).\n\nWhat's the key to deciding whether it's worth paying nearly $50 per share for $1 in earnings? It's the growth story behind NVIDIA and its continued path. NVIDIA's performance over the past few years suggests that it has a very good growth habit to reach its valuation levels. Just look at its P/E ratio in July 2023 - over 240x! Now, what surprises me is that buyers of NVIDIA actually made a lot of money during that time :)\n\nHow is that possible? NVIDIA's earnings are growing faster than its valuation. That's why you observe that valuation multiples have been declining since early 2024. Yes, the valuation multiple is now up nearly 50x, but ...... if NVIDIA continues on this path, delivers on its intended product roadmap, and the world continues to move towards an AI-driven economy, NVIDIA's current valuation will look cheap in a few years.\n\nRisk factors? There are many, and there are no risk-free investments in the stock market. If the Trump administration escalates the trade war, which is currently on hold, NVIDIA could face some short-term issues that would impact NVIDIA's supply and customer operations. Yes, NVIDIA is well prepared for these changes, with some production being shifted to the U.S. and adjusted supply for Chinese customers (due to export restrictions). Any economic or geopolitical fluctuations could also hurt market sentiment, but in the long run I don't see this as a factor.\n\nSo, as an investor with a long-term focus and a bright future for NVIDIA, not only am I not selling any shares, I'm adding to my holdings. For me, NVIDIA remains a \u2018Strong Buy\u2019 stock. Cheers!",

    "selftext": "Just saw the big news: Trump brokered a mineral deal between the U.S. and the DRC that will give U.S. firms access to key minerals such as cobalt, tantalum, lithium, and copper in exchange for U.S. support for the Congo-Rwanda peace deal \n\nThis looks like more than just geopolitical maneuvering, it could have long-term implications for the stock market and certain stocks.\n\nBrief summary\n\nThe U.S., pushed by Trump, brokered a peace deal between Congo and Rwanda and signed a multi-billion dollar \u201cminerals for security\u201d agreement.\n\nTrump's allies and private companies (including Massad Boulos) plan to invest over $500 million to build a smelter there, with the goal of moving away from dependence on the Chinese mineral chain.\n\nWhy this deserves investor attention\n\nKEY MINERALS, STRATEGIC MATERIALS \n\nThe Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) controls roughly 70 percent of the world's cobalt and 60 percent of its tantalum reserves-metals widely used in electric car batteries, chips, electronics, and military technology.\n\nIf the U.S. can establish its own supply chain, the global industrial landscape could be rewritten.\n\nCapital Flows Could Change \n\nIf U.S. miners and tech companies get in first, companies like Freeport-McMoRan (FCX), Albemarle (ALB), or lithium material companies like Livent (LTHM) could be the winners.\n\n Geo Risks vs Market Opportunities \n\nThe Congo situation remains complex - if a peace deal stands, commodity prices could stabilize and U.S. firms may be able to gain control of resources in the long term; conversely, a short-term landmine.\n\nImpact on Tech & EV Sectors \n\nOEMs such as Tesla and the battery chain (e.g., NVDA, TSLA, BATT-type ETFs) could benefit if cobalt and lithium supplies become more stable and EV production costs fall.\n\nCURRENT MARKET REACTION: \n\nGlobal mining stocks rallied in the early stages of the peace deal rumors, but then retreated as details of the deal remain unclear\n\nMarket Sentiment: cautiously optimistic and bullish in the long term, but short-term uncertainties remain (situation, implementation, opposition factions, etc.)\n\nMy recommendations from an investment perspective\n\nLong-term Layout Focus on resource stocks (e.g. ALB, FCX) - once the agreement is implemented, it is a probable event for US companies to acquire substantial mineral resources.\n\nMedium-term ideas Tracking battery, electric vehicle sector - if the cost of raw materials downward, vehicle margins and growth logic benefit.\n\nShort-term operation Pay attention to the progress of events - the peace agreement is unstable and may be repeated; if you intervene, you can add a stop loss or hedge.\n\nMacro observation If the United States to \u201cresource diplomacy\u201d as a means of follow-up in Greenland, Ukraine and other places may also have similar operations.\n\nSome of my questions\n\nHas anyone been following cobalt or lithium resource stocks? Any early layouts for this wave?\n\nDo you think this peace deal is sustainable, or is it just a \u201cpaper peace\u201d?\n\nBigger question: does this mean that China is loosening its grip on key minerals?",

OKLO failed to break $60 in premarket but interested in watching further.\n\n[**NVDA (NVIDIA)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&p=d)\\-NVDA hit an all-time high along with the market, as the U.S. and China agreed on a trade framework and Iran/Israel tensions de-escalated. Momentum has continued as macro fears (mainly from Israel/Iran) die down and AI infrastructure investment remains elevated (CRWV acquiring CORZ). Interested in seeing if NVDA can hold above prior day's low ($153.49), momentum is pretty sustained and the move can continue far longer than anyone can expect. Since the trade framework with China was agreed upon, the next catalyst I'm potentially interested in is lifting of chip restrictions in China. \n\n[**PONY (Pony AI)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=PONY&p=d)/UBER- UBER is reportedly in talks to support Travis Kalanick\u2019s acquisition of the US arm of Pony AI. A successful deal would reintroduce Kalanick to the self-driving space, and potentially integrate autonomous capabilities within Uber\u2019s broader platform strategy.

Once the volume increases and breaks through, follow to open small positions. If there is a false breakout, the stop-loss is extremely small (usually less than 1%).\n\nAuxiliary indicators use simple moving averages (such as EMA20, EMA50) + RSI divergence to determine whether the breakout is healthy.\n\nLast week, I followed up with a small position using this framework when $NVDA broke through 1100, with a profit target in the 1150 range. The stop-loss is set below 1085, and the risk is very controllable.\n\nI wouldn't say this is a \"sure-win strategy\", but its advantage lies in:\n\nThe risk is low, the cost of making mistakes is low, and it does not rely on prediction but only on market signals. It is suitable for volatile markets and the initial trend formation stage\n\nWhich stock/index breakthrough opportunities have you been observing recently? Let's all discuss our ideas together \\~",

    "selftext": "Nvidia Corporation is attractively valued and its strong EPS growth and profitability outpacing peers make it a compelling entry point. AI-driven demand from hyperscalers and new sovereign deals (UAE, Saudi Arabia) provides long-term headroom for continued growth. Despite the loss of China revenues and recent price stagnation, NVIDIA's fundamentals remain strong and its market leadership unquestioned. I am upgrading my rating on NVDA stock to Strong Buy, believing it is capable of delivering superior returns and has the potential to reach a $10 trillion valuation.\n\n\n\nWhen I looked at NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA ) late last year, I thought the stock had a pretty good shot at 2025. While the stock has soared, the valuation has fallen because of strong earnings growth, thanks in large part to the seemingly never-ending demand for GPUs in exascale computing platforms. 2025 was destined to be the \u201cYear of Blackwell,\u201d and I expected the stock to continue to rise, albeit at a slower pace than in previous years.\n\nInstead, we saw the stock briefly try to break out to a new all-time high, or ATH, before reversing sharply and selling off. We know the various reasons for this reversal. On the one hand, the broader market sold off amid tariff uncertainty, and few companies were immune. the release of DeepSeek (DEEPSEEK) in early 2025 triggered a sort of flash panic, with some claiming that the boom time for high-end chips was over. The logic was that DeepSeek would be able to save costs and increase efficiency so dramatically that companies running AI reasoning could rely on much less powerful chips. I think the evidence so far is that this reasoning is completely wrong, and instead we're seeing the Jevons Paradox come true.\n\nIt was probably inevitable that NVIDIA would now lose essentially all of its China-related revenue. At a recent conference, CFO Colette Kress pretty much poured cold water on the company's prospects for generating further revenue in China.\n\nIn my opinion, NVIDIA is attractively valued. The two best performers this year among the Big 7 tech giants have been Microsoft and Meta. looking at how NVIDIA compares to these peers, I see a big gap between them at the moment. In terms of price-to-earnings ratio, NVIDIA's valuation sits right in the middle of the three, but in terms of return on invested capital and medium-term EPS projections, it's way ahead.",

Thune and Senate leadership basically shrugged him off. They\u2019re pushing this thing through  and fast\n\nHere\u2019s where it gets interesting from a market angle:\n\nThey're talking about cutting back the $40K SALT deduction to save money. But whatever they save might immediately get canceled out because there's also strong pressure to make temporary business tax breaks permanent  stuff like R&D deductions, bonus depreciation, and interest expensing\n\nThat\u2019s a huge deal if you're long big-cap tech, industrials, or healthcare. These tax breaks boost reported earnings pretty directly. If they go permanent, EPS estimates probably move higher without companies having to do anything operationally. Think MSFT, LMT, UNH  names like that\n\nBut here\u2019s the tradeoff: the bill\u2019s already inflationary. If they don\u2019t pay for it, bond yields are going to feel it. So while stocks might get an earnings tailwind, valuations could stay capped or even compress further if the 10Y starts creeping above 5% again\n\nAnd the AI provision buried in the bill? Wild. Originally it said states couldn\u2019t regulate AI for 10 years \u2014 a total federal preemption. Now they\u2019re walking that back to a softer \u201cyou lose broadband funding if you pass certain laws\u201d version. Doesn\u2019t matter much fiscally, but for megacaps like NVDA and GOOG, this is one less regulatory headache. The moat just got a little deeper\n\nOne curveball that could raise the cost: Section 899. It lets the president slap taxes on foreign countries seen as \"discriminatory.\" Some senators want to remove it, which could limit future revenue and geopolitical leverage. Not a today problem, but if you're watching defense and energy stocks tied to foreign trade, it matters\n\nAnd now there's infighting about Medicaid cuts. Josh Hawley\u2019s out here writing NYT op-eds saying this bill punishes working-class voters while handing corporate tax cuts. He\u2019s not totally wrong. If the GOP starts shifting back toward economic populism, how long do these business-friendly tax policies actually last?\n\nSo here\u2019s the real market question buried in all this: Are we about to get an earnings boost that the bond market completely wipes out?Because if you\u2019re buying the earnings upgrade but ignoring the debt story  you might be trading the right trend with the wrong multiple",

Could easily rip to $150+ from there.\n\nNot trying to fade the long-term trend here. I am just synthesizing unusual market activity, insider moves, options flow, sentiment, technical and news analysis.\n\nDisclaimer: Not Financial Advice.",

For context, I used to be a server which is how I made my money, but now I do not work and only earn a bit of money though babysitting/selling my old clothes/etc. This money has just been sitting in my checking and savings account for the last 3 years, earning less than a dollar of interest per year ...\n\nI did a lot of research and made a plan for what to do with this money. Keep in mind I am going to college in the fall, but I don't have to do any loans/payment because I got a lot of scholarships and parents got the rest. So I just wanted to ask how my plan is and if anyone has any advice:\n\nChecking account: $750 (I'm pretty frugal/don't spend much money, though I know I will have to spend more in college)\n\nHigh Yield Savings Account: $3000\n\nStocks (About $4500) These are the ones I currently have picked out and how much I would put in. Should I get rid of any and just put it all in SPLG or SCHD or is this ok?\n\nSPLG (50%) SCHD (35%) VUG (10%) NVDA (5%)\n\nthen i was thinking about putting $500 in a Vanguard Target Retirement Fund. But should I just wait until I get a part time job (probably a few months) to make a Roth IRA? Because you need income to contribute to one right?\n\nTo summarize I just want to know if those stocks I picked are good or if I should get rid of some or choose others, and if I should make a Vanguard Target Retirement Fund or wait until I have a job to make a Roth IRA.",

    "selftext": "Hi guys, so I know this question was asked before. But I hope to hear your opinions on this. I know buying VOO etf and contribute every month is the key. However, I can't ignore the fact that there are some relatively safe mega cap companies with growth potential like NVDA, Amazon, Google. etc. As of now, my portfolio includes NVDA, amazon, google, Apple & baba.\n\nI did a quick calculation on compounding interest for VOO. In 5 years, with an average of 9% return (I am being conservative here), a $50k initial investment with no monthly contribution in VOO could be $76,931. So basically around 50% return after 5 years. If I put $1000 monthly contribution, the amount would be $148,747 after 5 years. This is almost triple.\n\nNow mega caps like amazon, google, NVDA, a 50% increase in their market cap in 5 years is possible. But these companies are 2-3 trillions now. They will certain get bigger but 50% bigger is a lot and pretty sure they won't get triple in 5 years. Looking back 5 most recent years, SP500 has been up 94.58% while Amazon lags behind only 68.57%. Google did better at 139.82%. Apple is 153.9%. Microsoft is 152%. NVDA is a different monster at 1455%.\n\nSo now I start to regret my buying strategy. I should just buy VOO and make monthly contribution, and only keep smaller positions for these stock picks. Am I missing something here? is VOO's compound interest that powerful? is there any downside for investing in SP500 ?",

I am targeting potentially good candidates for short-term trading; I have no opinion on them as investments. The potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting, everything else is secondary.\n\nNews: [Trump's Trade Strategy Upended After Court Blocks Global Tariffs](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-29/trump-s-trade-strategy-upended-after-court-blocks-global-tariffs)\n\n[**QQQ**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=QQQ&p=d)**/**[**SPY**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SPY&p=d)**/**[**VXX**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=VXX&p=d)\\-A judge panel U.S. Court of International Trade ruled that President Trump's \"Liberation Day\" tariffs were unlawful and exceeded presidential authority. The court stated they lacked a valid national emergency justification and infringed upon congressional powers. We saw a huge move in the market afterhours yesterday, mainly interested to see if we can continue the move. Is the tariff madness over? Absolutely not, but I'm interested in seeing if we keep momentum upwards. \n\n[**NVDA (NVIDIA)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&p=d)\\-NVDA reported Q1 revenue of $44.1B, with data center revenue at $39.1B vs $39.3B exp. The company said that guidance would have been $8B higher except for lost sales from the China restriction on H20 chips. I was mainly interested in the $140 level yesterday and we blew past that afterhours yesterday. Overall, great earnings report with further hopes that China restriction is lifted. Not too interested in  Keep in mind that ATH is \\~$152.\n\n[**ELF (e.l.f.

The transaction is $600M cash/$200M in stock, and potential $200M earnout based on Rhode's growth over the next three years. This ended up reversing ELF's earnings report yesterday (which was negative due to the thread of tariffs), and signaled that ELF is moving into skincare. We've made a pretty huge move up to $105.\n\n[**TSLA (Tesla)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TSLA&p=d)\\-Tesla plans to launch its robotaxi service in Austin on June 12, utilizing driverless Model Y vehicles. Elon Musk also confirmed he is leaving the government DOGE initiative and will focus on the company. This has been on a tear for the past month- that break from the $300 level was what I was most interested in, interested if we set up again for $375/$400. The launch of its robotaxi service is another way to signal that it's challenging Waymo, but whether it will succeed without LIDAR or not is another question. Regulation news/catalysts are the biggest potential movers of the robotaxis news.",

    "selftext": "I had\u00a0[mentioned yesterday](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1kx5azw/nvidias_longterm_prospects_remain_terrific_im/)\u00a0that I wasn\u2019t going to hedge Nvidia\u2019s Q1 earnings, ignore the noise, and stay invested for the long term. Now I\u2019m kicking myself for not buying more when it was $130-$132.\u00a0**Nonetheless, I plan to add more, paying $10 extra for a stock I expect to reach over $250 in the next three years, is OK. And I can always add more on declines.**\n\nThe small $ 1 Bn beat for Q1 results was impressive considering the $ 2.5 Bn in lost H-20 sales to China, but even more astounding was the reaffirmed guidance of $ 45 Bn for Q2,\u00a0**in spite of $8 Bn in H-20 lost sales in Q2.**\u00a0One can imagine where the stock would have skyrocketed if guidance had come in at $ 53 Bn instead of $ 45 Bn!\n\n**Trying to thread the needle and trade Nvidia is missing the woods for the trees.**\u00a0\n\n**Inferencing demand is a major revenue catalyst for Nvidia over the next several years, as evidenced by the significant increase in tokenization. Similarly, seen is Agentic AI demand, which is a revenue-bearing product of reasoning and inference, and will continue to grow.**\n\nThis was Jensen Huang on the conference call today on inference demand.\n\n>\u201cWell, we would like to serve all of it, and I think we're on track to serve most of it. Grace Blackwell NVLink72 is the ideal engine today, the ideal computer thinking machine, if you will, for reasoning AI. There's a couple of reasons for that. The first reason is that the token generation amount, the number of tokens reasoning goes through, is 100 times, 1,000 times more than a one-shot chatbot. It's essentially thinking to itself, breaking down a problem step-by-step. It might be planning multiple paths to an answer. It could be using tools, reading PDFs, reading web pages, watching videos, and then producing a result, an answer. The longer it thinks, the better the answer, the smarter the answer is. And so, what we would like to do, and the reason why Grace Blackwell was designed to give such a giant step-up in inference performance, is so that you could do all this and still get a response as quickly as possible. Compared to Hopper, Grace Blackwell is some 40 times higher speed and throughput compared. And so, this is going to be a huge, huge benefit in driving down the cost while improving the quality of response with excellent quality of service at the same time.\u201d\n\n**One-year product cadence:**\u00a0Nvidia has been very proactive when it comes to its product line-up, and showed off an ambitious slate of coming products at its\u00a0[annual GTC conference](https://www.wsj.com/finance/stocks/nvidias-big-show-hits-its-marks-but-plays-to-tough-crowd-35462acb?mod=article_inline)\u00a0in March, including updated versions of its Blackwell chips that are in particularly high demand by companies trying to build up state-of-the-art AI networks.\u00a0\n\n[According to the Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/business/earnings/nvidia-nvda-q1-earnings-report-2025-62ff6a10?mod=hp_lead_pos4), analysts expect the Blackwell lineup alone to generate nearly $98 billion in sales in the current fiscal year ending in January and a further $119 billion next year.\n\nAnd Blackwell contributed about 70% of datacenter sales in Q1-26, successfully transitioning from the Hopper series\n\n**I suspect that the $200 Bn revenue number for FY 2026 will be short, and with all the sovereign and other AI demand, it might even be exceeded, even without Chinese sales, with GPU cluster investment announcements from sovereign AI and Oracle and xAi, easily making up for the lost sales.**\n\nAccelerated computing is the new paradigm, and I can see Nvidia dominating in every sphere of accelerated computing.\u00a0\n\nFrom Jensen Huang on the Nvidia earnings call.\u00a0\n\n>\u201cSo, that's the fundamental reason. That was the core driving reason for Grace Blackwell NVLink72. Of course, in order to do that, we had to reinvent, literally redesign the entire way that these supercomputers are built, and -- but now we're in full production. It's going to be exciting. It's going to be incredibly exciting. And so, computing is one stack, one part of it. But remember, enterprise IT is really three pillars; it's compute, storage, and networking. And we've now put all three of them together finally, and we're going to market with that.\"\n\n\n\nCloud computing was just the start; these will follow.\u00a0\n\n**On-Premise Computing and PCS**\u00a0\u2013 Nvidia has already announced new products \u2013\u00a0 RTX Pro Enterprise AI server that runs everything On-Prem. DGX Spark and DGX Station, which are going to replace \u201ctraditional\u201d CPU-run PCs, are designed for developers who want to work on-prem.\n\n**Enterprise AI**\u00a0is still a very nascent market and could be huge for Nvidia. A computing system that can integrate and run enterprise AI stacks, run enterprise IT stacks, but add AI to them. The Networking platform business using NVLink is available for competitors to make advanced GPU clusters.\n\n**Physical and Industrial AI**\u00a0\u2013 through the Omniverse and robotics:\u00a0\n\nJensen Huang on the earnings call:\n\n>\u00a0\u201cAnd then lastly, industrial AI. Remember, one of the implications of the world reordering, if you will, is a region's onshoring manufacturing and building plants everywhere. In addition to AI factories, of course, there are new electronics manufacturing, chip manufacturing being built around the world. And all of these new plants and these new factories are creating exactly the right time when Omniverse and AI and all the work that we're doing with robotics is emerging. And so, this fourth pillar is quite important.\"\n\n\n\nEvery factory will have an AI factory associated with it. And in order to create these physical AI systems, you really have to train a vast amount of data. So, back to more data, more training, more AIs to be created, more computers. And so, these four drivers are really kicking into turbocharge.\u201d\n\n**NeoClouds**\u00a0\u2013 Small business AI rentals through NeoClouds, like Coreweave and Nebius, should be a huge business.\u00a0\n\nLost in all this was Gaming revenue, which grew 42% to $3.76 billion, 33% above analysts\u2019 forecasts! $ 1 Bn beat on $2.78 estimate \u2013 that is extremely impressive and attributed to Blackwell\u2019s product strengths. Auto was another gainer, jumping to $567Mn up 72% YoY.\n\n**I believe we\u2019re in just the 2nd innings of a 9 innings AI revolution, and my 3-year target for Nvidia is $250, and I\u2019ll continue to add on declines.**",

This is a once-in-a-lifetime**\u00a0opportunity, and for once it\u2019s not a cliche.\n\nThe momentum around inferencing, and the computing power needs for inferencing and reasoning models suggest that Nvidia\u2019s is a supply problem \u2013 and even if the $ 200 Bn revenue estimate for FY Jan 2026 is off by a small percent, FY 2027 to FY 2030, will more than make up for it.\u00a0\n\nMorgan Stanley\u2019s Joseph Moore, who has an Overweight rating and $160 price target on Nvidia, said the Jensen Huang-led company is likely to be fine if it can show investors that rack supply has accelerated.\n\n**\u201cOur data points would suggest that in recent weeks, the full year rack forecasts have started to be revised upwards by 50 %+,\u201d Moore added, citing recent channel checks that suggest the issues have been resolved and are now starting to show up in numbers.**\n\n**Additionally, investors appear to be underestimating the \u201cunprecedented explosive token growth\u201d commentary coming from Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN) and Google (GOOG) (GOOGL), Moore posited.**\n\n**\u201cEvery hyperscaler has reported unanticipated strong token growth,\u201d Moore explained. \u201cBut our conviction is not driven by that, it\u2019s driven by the fact that literally everyone we talk to in the space is telling us that they have been surprised by inference demand, and there is a scramble to add GPUs.\u201d**\n\nMoore continued: \u201cThis is not driven by the limitless aspirations for training megaclusters fueled by highly speculative venture capitalists;\u00a0**this is proof that the models are being used, and driving revenue,**\u00a0which mitigates the biggest overhang on NVIDIA stock that this is all driven by venture funding that will dry up.\u00a0**The strength we highlight here is driven by usage, by the revenue-generating part of the business, and provides proof points that the scaling of inference as we move to reasoning-oriented models is a real thing.**\u00a0We are seeing this spanning geographies, as well, so published concerns about China having stockpiled H20s seem inaccurate.\u201d\n\n**I think Nvidia will have a similar overwhelming market share and growth in inference GPUs and their 1 year product roadmap ensures that they remain ahead of the competition\u2013 this is just the beginning.**",

    "title": "Nvidia earnings Trump tariff updates, and the Fed's preferred inflation gauge: What to know this week",
    "selftext": "Stocks' feverish rebound over the past month is now on pause as growing concerns about the fiscal deficit have sent Treasury yields roaring higher and President Trump is once again threatening to escalate tariffs.\n\n\n\nOn Friday, Trump threatened to place a direct 25% tariff on Apple products not made in the US while also warning he'd ramp up duties on the European Union to 50% at the start of June. This solidified a week of decline for stocks as the Nasdaq Composite (\\^IXIC) and Dow Jones Industrial Average (\\^DJI) dropped about 2.4%. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 (\\^GSPC) slid roughly 2.6% on the week.\n\n\n\nIn the week ahead, updates on the trade war and Trump's pending tax bill will remain in focus, while quarterly results from Nvidia (NVDA) are expected to take center stage on Wednesday after the market close. Reports from Okta (OKTA), Salesforce (CRM), and Costco (COST) will also receive investor attention.\n\n\n\nThe release of the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge on Friday will headline the economic data schedule. Markets will be closed on Monday for Memorial Day.\n\n\n\nTariff escalation\n\nPresident Trump's policies have continued to drive markets. Concerns over Trump's tax bill boosting the government deficit have pushed Treasury yields higher. At over 5.1%, the 30-year Treasury yield (\\^TYX) had been hovering near its highest level since 2007, while the 10-year Treasury yield (\\^TNX) had pressed above 4.6%, its highest level since February.\n\n\n\nBut the sell-off in bonds eased on Friday as Trump once again threatened to escalate tariffs, sending a reminder to investors that even with a 90-day tariff pause on a wide swath of countries, the trade policy whipsaw in markets is far from over.\n\n\n\n\"Safe to say for the time being we\u2019ve hit 'trough' trade uncertainty,\" Piper Sandler chief investment strategist Michael Kantrowitz wrote in a note to clients on Friday. \"At this point markets need to see these tariffs retracted AND bond yields to not spike again for any material move higher.\"\n\n\n\nFriday's decline in treasuries sent the 10-year below the key 4.5% level Kantrowitz has been watching. As Kantrowitz highlights in the chart below, once the 10-year Treasury yield has risen above 4.5%, interest rate-sensitive stocks have seen increased underperformance in recent years.\n\n\n\nThis played out in last week's market action with the Russell 2000 Index (\\^RUT), which has many companies with more interest rate exposure than the S&P 500, falling nearly 4% compared to the S&P 500's 2.6% decline.\n\n\n\nThe AI leader reports\n\nNvidia is set to report quarterly results on Wednesday after the market close. Investors will be closely watching for any updates on demand from the leading supplier of AI chips. For the quarter, Nvidia is expected to report adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.88 on revenue of $43.3 billion, according to Bloomberg analyst consensus data. The company reported adjusted EPS of $0.61 on revenue of $26 billion in the same period last year.\n\n\n\nGiven Nvidia's position as one of the top holdings in the S&P 500, investors will also be watching how the report affects other tech stocks and the broader market. Shares of Nvidia are roughly flat this year after whipsawing amid growing fears of AI competition and tariff concerns.\n\n\n\nSince the launch of ChatGPT in November 2022, Nvidia alone has accounted for about 17% of the S&P 500's gains.\n\n\n\nPrice check\n\nTariffs have increased fears that inflation could spike again. But there's been little evidence of a resurgence thus far in economic data, and economists expect a similar story to play out in the coming week.\n\n\n\nA fresh look at a key inflation measure will come on Friday with the April PCE release. Economists project annual \"core\" PCE \u2014 which excludes the volatile categories of food and energy \u2014 to have clocked in at 2.5% in April, down from the 2.6% seen in March. Over the prior month, economists project \"core\" PCE at 0.1%, above the 0% seen the month prior.",

The chipmaking giant recently\u00a0returned to the $3 trillion market-capitalization\u00a0level after its share price\u00a0rallied by around 50%\u00a0from its April low. The earnings report follows the company\u2019s announcement that it will supply semiconductors to\u00a0Saudi Arabian AI startup Humain. Nvidia reported\u00a078% year-over-year revenue growth\u00a0in its prior earnings release.\u00a0Semiconductor firm Marvell Technology\u00a0is also scheduled to report this week.\n\nSalesforce\u2019s expected report on Wednesday comes after the cloud software provider\u00a0reported 8% revenue growth\u00a0in its prior quarter on the growth of its Agentforce custom AI platform. While the firm delivered a worse-than-expected outlook, analysts said the company had\u00a0strong potential for growth.\n\nThursday\u2019s scheduled report from Dell Technologies will show whether the computer maker continues to benefit from increased demand for AI infrastructure after it\u00a0grew server and networking sales by 37%\u00a0in the prior quarter. Morgan Stanley recently\u00a0raised its price target\u00a0for the company, citing growing server sales momentum on AI demand. Market watchers will also be following computer equipment maker HP\u2019s scheduled report on Wednesday.\n\nCostco Wholesale is on Thursday\u2019s corporate calendar, coming as the membership-based retailer reported that its\u00a0April sales rose by 7%, which analysts attributed partly to customers rushing purchases ahead of U.S. tariffs. Costco\u00a0reported a 9% revenue growth\u00a0in its prior quarter on increased revenue from higher membership fees.\n\nAutoZone\u2019s scheduled report on Tuesday follows an\u00a0upgrade from Bank of America Securities\u00a0as analysts argued that higher auto costs from U.S. tariffs could lead to more vehicle repairs by cost-conscious drivers. Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods\u2019 expected report on Wednesday follows its\u00a0recent deal to acquire\u00a0sporting goods retailer Foot Locker (FL).\n\nInvestors will be watching the scheduled Thursday report from Chinese EV Li Auto, which\u00a0competes with Tesla\u00a0(TSLA) sales in that nation. The Tuesday report from PDD Holdings comes as the parent of Chinese-based online retailer Temu faces pressure from U.S. tariffs.\n\nInflation, GDP, Fed Speakers in Focus\n\nFriday\u2019s scheduled release of the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index will show how the Federal Reserve\u2019s preferred measure of inflation fared in April. A similar inflation reading showed that price increases\u00a0cooled somewhat in April, and the Fed has said it is\u00a0closely watching prices\u00a0in the wake of Trump\u2019s tariffs.\n\nWednesday\u2019s expected release of the minutes of the\u00a0May meeting of the FOMC\u00a0will provide more insight into Fed officials\u2019 deliberations over interest rates and the economy. Likewise, several Fed officials are scheduled to speak during the week, including Fed Gov. Waller, New York Fed President Williams, and San Francisco Fed President Daly.\n\nRevisions to first-quarter GDP are expected on Thursday after the initial report last month showed that the\u00a0economy shrank\u00a0in the first three months of 2025.\n\nThe state of the consumer will also be in focus for investors, with reports on consumer confidence and consumer sentiment scheduled to be released this week. The reports come as recent surveys show that\u00a0consumers\u2019 moods have soured\u00a0over concerns that tariffs will drive prices higher. Friday\u2019s expected reports on the U.S. trade deficit, retail inventories, and wholesale inventories will provide more detail on how U.S. tariffs are affecting the economy.\u00a0",

(NVDA) Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang to ease restrictions on chip exports to the world\u2019s second largest economy.\n\n\u201cWe obviously have huge respect for Jensen,\u201d Sriram Krishnan, White House senior policy adviser for artificial intelligence, said in a Bloomberg Television interview Wednesday. \u201cWhen it comes to inside China, I do think there is still bipartisan and broad concern about what can happen to these GPUs once they\u2019re physically inside\u201d the country, he added.\n\nWhile the Trump administration still sees a security risk from widening AI chip exports to China, Krishnan said it agrees with Huang\u2019s view that restrictions on a wide range of other US trading partners need to be revisited. The Trump administration is rescinding and moving to replace the Biden-era AI diffusion rule that Krishnan said created \u201cGPU haves and GPU have nots.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to the rest of the world, we want American AI stack starting from the GPUs to the models to everything on top,\u201d Krishnan said. \u201cOn that, Jensen and I and us are in agreement.\u201d\n\nKrishnan spoke hours after Huang made his most forceful public comments to date against escalating US export restrictions aimed at China. Speaking at the Computex industry conference in Taipei, Huang blasted the measures as a \u201cfailure\u201d and urged the US to lower barriers to chip sales in China before American firms cede the market to rivals such as Huawei Technologies Co.\n\nHuang told reporters that China will account for a $50 billion opportunity in 2026. \u201cChina has 50% of the world\u2019s AI developers, and it\u2019s important that when they develop on an architecture, they develop on Nvidia, or at least American technology,\u201d he said. Nvidia recently wrote off $5.5 billion in H20 AI chips that had been designed to comply with previous export curbs, but were targeted by a new round of restrictions from the Trump administration this year.\n\nKrishnan pointed to the flurry of projects in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates announced by American companies during President Donald Trump\u2019s trip to the Middle East last week as evidence of a new effort to ease US allies\u2019 access to AI. He stressed that the agreements would still contain security restrictions to prevent the illegal transfer of advanced technology to China and other adversaries.\n\n\u201cThese deals and these GPUs are predominantly going to be run by American hyperscalers, American cloud service providers and American companies,\u201d said Krishnan, who was a general partner at venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz prior to joining the White House. \u201cMost of these GPUs are going to be run, hosted, controlled by American companies.\u201d",

At the time, Nvidia said it expected to take a $5.5 billion charge related to inventory and purchase commitments from the new restrictions for its fiscal first quarter.\n\n\u201cThis additional ban on Nvidia\u2019s H20 is deeply painful,\u201d Huang\u00a0said\u00a0in a Stratechery interview published on Monday. \u201cWe walked away from $15 billion of sales and probably\u2014what is it? \u2014 $3 billion worth of taxes\u201d for the U.S.\n\nCritics have said offering Nvidia\u2019s artificial-intelligence chips to China\u2014even one or two generations old\u2014can help companies in China catch up to the U.S. in AI technology. Huang disagrees. He believes the restrictions are shortsighted and will, in reality, help China in the long run.\n\nA morning briefing on what you need to know in the day ahead, including exclusive commentary from Barron's and MarketWatch writers.\n\nThe restrictions opens the market in China for increased usage of Huawei\u2019s AI chips, he said. If more companies use Huawei\u2019s chips and the Chinese company can refine its software, Nvidia\u2019s current CUDA software advantage could erode.\n\n\u201cAnybody who thought that one chess move to somehow ban China from H20s would somehow cut off their ability to do AI is deeply uninformed,\u201d Huang said. \u201cIf we don\u2019t compete in China, and we allow the Chinese ecosystem to build a rich ecosystem because we\u2019re not there to compete for it, and new platforms are developed and they\u2019re not American at a time when the world is diffusing AI technology, their leadership and their technology will diffuse all around the world.\u201d\n\nThe executive also argues by limiting access to Nvidia\u2019s products it forces companies to provide financial resources to Huawei, which the company will then use for R&D to compete with Nvidia.",

I am targeting potentially good candidates for short-term trading; I have no opinion on them as investments. The potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting, everything else is secondary.\n\nNews: [Deepseek Races After Chatgpt As China's AI Industry Soars](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2025-05-13/deepseek-races-after-chatgpt-as-china-s-ai-industry-soars)\n\n[**NVDA (Nvidia)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&p=d)\\- NVDA is set to ship 18,000 of its advanced GB300 Grace Blackwell AI chips to Saudi Arabia's Humain for a 500 MW data center project. Additionally, the Trump administration is considering a deal that would allow the UAE to purchase over a million NVDA AI chips, easing previous export restrictions. This caused NVDA to skyrocket 10 points yesterday, watching for additional momentum today. Interested if we can make an equivalent move today and if the trend is strong, might buy a little if so- note that NVDA has earnings on 5/28. Overall interesting that NVDA is finding sales outside of China, but not sure if the ME can make up the shortfall.\n\n[**TSLA (Tesla)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TSLA&p=d)\\- TSLA has been on a tear ever since Musk has stepped away from DOGE, going from $275 -> $340 in 5 days. Was watching this since $300, the next major level I'm watching is $350- considering how we exploded upwards after the election, not very enthusiastic to short this unless we go to stupidly high levels like $400+. So for now, biased long. Musk has been controversially politically but the stock performance did hinge on his presence at the company, so interested to see if this is going to blow everyone out of the water shorting it (eg me) like last time lol. \n\n[**UNH (UnitedHealth Group)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=UNH&p=d)\\- UnitedHealth Group's CEO Andrew Witty has stepped down, and the company has suspended its 2025 forecast due to higher-than-expected medical costs, leading to a massive selloff yesterday. We dropped close to 70 points yesterday, I was personally hoping for the selloff to reach $300 but ultimately didn't get that far. Bought a little around $310 but will kick this out by selling calls against it because volatility is high. UNH has been through... a lot this year with Luigi and the CEO shooting, the proposed AI to analyze healthcare claims, and now this. We've fallen close to 40% after the *new* CEO stepped down as well. Expecting a small dead-cat bounce and a small slow recovery today, other than that not sure how they're going to navigate out of this.\n\n[**SMCI (Supermicro)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SMCI&p=d)\\- Supermicro has announced a multi-year $20B partnership with Saudi data center firm DataVolt to deliver GPU platforms and cooling systems for AI campuses in Saudi Arabia and the United States. Made a pretty large 10 point move yesterday, and I want to see if we can make an equivalent move today to see if the trend is strong- interested in the $50 level.\n\n**IPOs today:** [**ETOR**](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1kmetv6/the_etoro_ipo_boom_or_doom/) (DD is linked here)",

AMD mentioned a $1.5B revenue hit due to U.S. chip export restrictions to China, with $800M in costs linked to AI chip curbs. Overall pretty mixed results, stock spiked AH but gave back most of the gains, currently only up 1%. No particular level I'm watching. Overall I see less risk in this (and the other semis) now that most of the major chip companies (ARM reports today) have defined their losses due to the chip restriction- and we have clear defined numbers as to how much a stock will move if they're lifted. Obviously another bad catalyst would be completely stopping all exports, but that seems unlikely at this point.\n\n[**DIS (Disney)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=DIS&p=d)\\- Reported Q2 EPS of $1.45 vs. $1.21 expected and revenue of $23.6B vs. $23.34B exp. Raised full-year EPS outlook to $5.75, +16% vs. prior guidance. Parks revenue grew 6% to $8.9B. Disney+ added 1.4M subs, hitting $336M in operating profit. I looked into the earnings and interestingly, I think profitability over raw subscriber growth was the spotlight in Disney+. Overall great earnings, which they capped off with softening international parks revenue, then followed it up with a park in Abu Dhabi (lol). Disneyworld generates roughly $10M a day in revenue, so it'll be interesting to see how much a park in Abu Dhabi will cost (10 times more?? /s)\n\n[**SMCI (Super Micro Computer)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SMCI&p=d)\\- Issued weak guidance post-earnings, citing \u201ceconomic uncertainty and tariff impacts.\u201d EPS of 0.31 vs .50 exp, revenue of $4.60B vs. $5.42B expected. Ever since the spike back in February, this stock has essentially been (relatively) non-volatile, still watching $30 level. SMCI's server business is essentially linked to AI/data center build-outs- but this stock hasn't been moving that much with tech companies announcing greater AI spend. Accounting issues could return (highly unlikely), tariffs get worse, etc.\n\n[**PLTR (Palantir Technologies)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=PLTR&p=d)\\- Currently holding a short position due to the stock's massive run up to 125. Stop set at 115 (near yesterday\u2019s high), earnings were released on Monday. I kind of see a similar pattern that came when NVDA was trading near $140 in this stock: (NVDA obviously has better fundamentals than PLTR) but we had a massive run up, earnings that were excellent but still couldn't live up to the hype, and a subsequent selloff. For now, nothing has really changed my mind about covering my short unless we have a massive turn. Government spending cuts are the main risk for the company.",

While smartphones, computers, memory chips and several other categories of products are currently spared from tariffs, some exemptions could be reversed in coming weeks as part of an investigation into semiconductors.\n> \n> \u201cImposing tariffs and blocking things, I think it\u2019s moving backward,\u201d Suss MicroTec Chief Executive Burkhardt Frick said in an interview.\n> \n> President Trump in April slapped tariffs on dozens of nations, then relented with a 90-day suspension for most countries following market turmoil, allowing leaders to reach out for trade deals. However, Washington excluded Beijing from the 90-day pause and imposed tariffs amounting to 145%, prompting China to retaliate with duties on U.S. imports of 125%.\n> \n> \u201cEven this 90-day pause is just buying time, while the two big elephants in the room are still provoking each other,\u201d Frick said. \u201cI think nobody will benefit. It\u2019s a zero-sum game.\u201d\n> \n> An industry veteran with more than 30 years\u2019 experience, Frick spent around two decades working in Philips\u2019 mobile display and semiconductor business before joining Dutch semiconductor-equipment maker ASML Holding in 2014 as vice president of strategic sourcing and supply chain. He took the reins of Suss MicroTec in 2023.\n\n---\n\n> Now, the company is getting a broader mix in what Frick called a helpful development because if one area loses some momentum, the company still has other product groups to sustain growth.\n> \n> \u201cOf course, a global recession would help nobody, and that\u2019s what everybody is concerned about,\u201d he said.\n> \n> While appetite for semiconductors to power the data centers and servers behind the AI boom continues to thrive, the industry has been agonizing for more than a year over weak demand for legacy chips found in cars and industrial machinery.\n> \n> Some chip makers, like Tesla supplier STMicroelectronics, are signaling that a recovery might be on the way, but tariffs or export controls could jeopardize the complex supply chains that the industry has relied upon for decades and potentially raising prices for consumers, Frick said.\n> \n> \u201cWould you pay $3,000 or more for an iPhone?

I\u2019ve been buying the tariff dip on margin, with $1.4 million invested in blue chip stocks. I\u2019m up 46% in the past month. My largest buys have been in TSM, NVDA, ORCL, CAVA, AMZN, MSFT, META & SMH.\n\n1. Largest tax cut in history is coming. Republicans own the house and senate, and Trump is deadset on cutting taxes by $5 trillion. Obviously not good for the national debt but that will juice the economy big time. \n\n2. Midterms are coming in 2026, and Trump will not want to have a recession on his hands which would risk him loosing the house and senate. I am fully convinced he launched this tariff war so early on, so he could get it over with before midterms. Trump has pivoted extremely quickly on all reciprocal tariffs aside from china. And he is desperate to start negotiations with china. China and the U.S have both entered a de escalatatory tone, with both sides  making exemptions to tariffs, china expressing willingness to deal with fentanyl, and acknowledging the desire to negotiate- along side acknowledging that the U.S has reached out to them. They are BOTH eager to water down these tariffs and deep down, when both parties want the same thing (reduced tariffs) they will find a way to get it despite all the public bluster. Even if a deal could take months, they will likely have a pause either during or before negotiations. \n\n\n3. Rate cuts are coming later this year. It\u2019s likely there will be at least 2 rate cuts before year\u2019s end assuming tariff inflation does not cause extreme inflation. Rate cuts will boost the ability to borrow capital, increase liquidity and stimulating the economy. \n\n4. We are at the dawn of the largest productivity revolution in history. Everyone has seemed to forget about AI despite big tech earnings and guidance blowing it out of the park. MSFT, GOOG, and META are printing money, and AI is showing incredible returns in the semiconductor and data center space. We are still in the early stages of AI, the smarter it gets the more productivity will increase. \n\n5. The economy is currently strong. Jobs numbers in April (not a lagging indicator) were impressive. At the end of the day, so long as people are not losing their jobs the U.S consumer will stay resilient. Tariff effects could disrupt that if they stay in effect long term. However I think it\u2019s pretty obvious the worst of the tariffs are temporary. \n\n6. U.S exceptionalism is nowhere close to ending. We are miles ahead of every other economy in terms of innovation and technology. We lead in services, and nobody is boycotting GOOG, META, MSFT etc in a significant way. These innovative tech companies exist nowhere else in scale and success. Our consumer is 30% of the global economy and nowhere do they have such a wealthy large pool of consumers. We are still the world reserve currency with 59% of currency held abroad is dollars. And nobody, even Trump will let us lose that reserve currency status.",

This news initially broke overnight yesterday and the stock saw a 6 point drop. I personally had the bias that it would actually be bullish for the company, so I'll likely trade a second move rather than the first if I'm at the computer for the trade. Moved down to around 270 overnight, will watch for additional confirmation. As most of you know, Musk's political involvement has made him controversial, and by extension, TSLA as well.\n\n[**RBLX (Roblox)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=RBLX&p=d)\\- Reported Q1 results with a loss of $0.32 per share vs. $0.40 expected and bookings of $1.21B vs. $1.14B expected. Raised 2025 bookings guidance to $5.285B\u2013$5.36B, above analyst consensus of $5.27B. Interested in $74 level, other than that not too interested in the stock. No new risks beyond whatever has been said before (slower user growth, regulatory risks, platform outages, problems with minors, etc). Buy your kids some Robux!\n\n[**MSFT (Microsoft)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=MSFT&p=d)\\- EPS of $3.46 vs. $3.22 expected and revenue of $70.07B vs. $68.42B expected. Capex surged to $16.75B, up 53% YoY, as it ramps up AI infrastructure, noting expected AI capacity constraints beyond June. Interested in seeing if it holds above $430 at market open. Its outsized AI investment was of huge interest to me- this moved a lot of Mag 7 names higher, especially NVDA. It signaled that there's still room for growth for these chip-makers. Companies that rent out computing space such as CRWV also moved higher on this as well. (It signals that they'll do better on earnings). \n\n[**META (Meta)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=META&p=d)\\- Reported stronger-than-expected Q1 revenue; Q2 sales guided to $42.5B\u2013$45.5B. Increased 2025 capex forecast to $64B\u2013$72B, citing heightened infrastructure and AI investments. Also a huge mover, interested in it if it breaks the $600 level. Heavy AI spending along with digital ad rebound trends pushed semis upward, they stated their sector focus remains on monetization of AI-driven engagement tools.\n\n  \nEarnings: Tim AAPL AMZN, AMGN ",

    "selftext": "This is probably an extremely tired topic, but wanted some advice, or at least some personal stories from people who have had experience in the market.\n\nWhen the 2020 pandemic crash happened, I was 21 and had some money, so I started looking into investing. I was a complete rookie and an idiot, thinking that I was good at choosing companies when it was just a ridiculous bull market, and after coming out on a small plus side, I let go of the market for a very long time.\n\nIn February of this year, my father suddenly passed away. As we were going through his accounts and our family assets, we realized he was quite good with money, and alongside his monthly pension that will be given to my mother, we learned that we were going to be well off. After careful calculation, my mother decided to keep the pension, and one third of my father's assets. I was given around two thirds of the assets, which came out to roughly 280,000$.\n\nI'm from Korea, and for my entire life, always dreamed of moving to the States for a high paying job, but never had the money to get the education in order to do so. Now I do.\n\nAfter crunching the numbers, I've decided to put aside 80,000$ to pay for my living costs, tuition costs to prepare for my education in the States, and for some traveling. This will keep me fairly comfortable until the end of 2028. Which leaves 200,000$ for me to invest in, in order to build up my net worth for my time studying in America, before finally getting a job.\n\nThen Trump announced the tariffs, and I started to reconsider everything.\n\nThankfully, I was mostly cash when the market went down, and afterwards I had invested  up to 50,000$ back into the market. Mostly focusing on either dividend heavy companies or ETF's like VOO, SCHD, KO, PEPCO, and powerhouse tech companies like NVDA, AMZN, MSFT, and other sectors, as well as companies in other countries.\n\nMy issue now is whether to wait for the doom mindset that so many people seem to have about the current US administration and the market to take full effect and tank everything, or do I just DCA into the company roster that I made for the next few months, and just let the market do its thing for the next 3 to 4 years. I know that timing the market is stupid, and even if you time it perfectly, it's so stressful anyways. I kinda just want to invest and not think about it constantly.\n\nI woud love to hear your long-term investing stories to settle my mind. Been very anxious about all of this in the last month or so.",

SMCI attributed the shortfall to delayed customer platform decisions and higher inventory reserves from older generation products. We're close to 20% down and with all the negative news on semi competition from China and server costs, I'm looking to play a bounce in this if the selloff gets worse. No real level I'm watching, likely will move with the market today. SMCI cited that inventory is increasing and as a result affected NVDA/DELL afterhours as well. DELL is down 6%! Potential supply chain disruptions like tariffs continue to be the biggest risk. \n\n[**SPY (S&P 500 ETF)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SPY&p=d) / [**QQQ (NASDAQ-100 ETF)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=QQQ&p=d)\\- The U.S. economy contracted by 0.3% in Q1 2025, marking the first decline since 2022, driven by a surge in imports and decreased government spending. Jamie Dimon said that a recession is a \"best case scenario\", ultimately looking at how bad the selloff will be today. The broader market is grappling with uncertainties stemming from trade tensions and tariff implementations, and the contraction news. Might take a minor VXX long as well \n\n[**NVDA (NVIDIA)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&p=d)\\- DeepSeek released its Prover-V2-671B model on Hugging Face, a 671B parameter AI model trained on Huawei\u2019s Ascend 910B chips. Obviously bad if Deepseek can release a competitive model that wasn't built on NVDA's chips like last time. This was also affected by SMCI news, so I'm interested in this today if we near $100 near the open.\n\n[**SNAP (Snap Inc.)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SNAP&p=d)\\- Snap reported Q1 2025 revenue of $1.36B vs. $1.35B expected, with a net loss of $140M, narrowing from the previous year. Daily active users reached 460 million, slightly above expectations. However, the company declined to provide Q2 guidance, citing macroeconomic uncertainties. Interested in this below $7, otherwise not interested mainly due to all the other things going on today. The digital advertising sector faces challenges due to changing trade policies and economic uncertainties, impacting revenue streams for advertising. Ultimately can be a huge loser if tariffs/recession goes through.\n\n**Earnings today:** MSFT, META, HOOD, QCOM",

    "title": "US Economy Contracts for First Time Since 2022 on Imports Surge",
    "selftext": ">The US economy contracted at the start of the year for the first time since 2022 on a monumental pre-tariffs import surge and softer consumer spending, a first snapshot of the ripple effects from President Donald Trump\u2019s trade policy.\n\n>Inflation-adjusted\u00a0gross domestic product\u00a0decreased an annualized 0.3% in the first quarter, well below average growth of about 3% in the prior two years, according to the government\u2019s initial estimate published Wednesday. Net exports\u00a0subtracted\u00a0nearly 5 percentage points from GDP, the most on record, the Bureau of Economic Analysis report showed.\n\n>Consumer spending\u00a0\u2014 which accounts for two-thirds of GDP \u2014 advanced at a 1.8% pace, the weakest since mid-2023. Business\u00a0outlays for equipment, the lone bright spot in the report, increased an annualized 22.5%.\n\n|Indicator|Actual|Estimate|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|GDP|\\-0.3%|\\-0.2%|\n|Personal consumption|\\+1.8%|\\+1.2%|\n|PCE price index, excl. food, energy|\\+3.5%|\\+3.1%|\n\n>The GDP data highlight the scramble by companies to secure merchandise ahead of expansive tariffs. Looking ahead, many economists anticipate the higher duties will cause a\u00a0supply shock, challenging businesses and leading to a pullback in demand as higher prices push cash-strapped Americans closer to the brink.\n\n>Forecasters currently see\u00a0nearly even\u00a0odds of the US falling into a recession in the next year. Consumers are also growing increasingly anxious that tariffs will take a toll on the labor market and drive up the cost of living.\n\n>The latest GDP figures showed\u00a0imports\u00a0surged an annualized about 41% \u2014 the biggest advance in nearly five years. Because these goods and services aren\u2019t produced in the US, they are subtracted from GDP. Economists see the sharp widening of the trade deficit reversing in the second quarter.\n\n>Typically, imported merchandise moves into warehouses or directly to storefronts. However, the report showed\u00a0business inventories\u00a0contributed 2.25 percentage points to GDP during the quarter, the most since the end of 2021. The recent flood imports may instead show up in higher inventories in coming months and, along with a narrowing trade gap, provide a lift to second-quarter GDP.\n\n>Because swings in trade and inventories can sometimes distort overall GDP, economists prefer looking at\u00a0final sales\u00a0to private domestic purchasers for a better snapshot of demand. This measure increased at a 3% pace in the first quarter after rising an annualized 2.9% at the end of 2024.\n\n>Growth in consumer spending was driven by services and nondurable goods.\n\nLink: [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-30/us-economy-contracts-for-first-time-since-2022-on-imports-surge](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-30/us-economy-contracts-for-first-time-since-2022-on-imports-surge)\n\n**My take:** As is commonly said, we haven't even begun to feel the effects of Trump's trade policy yet- shortages of products haven't begun hitting American consumers, but we're going to start feeling the effects this summer. We're likely in for a painful day in the markets today.\n\nI'm mainly interested in consumer discretionary companies to day trade (SBUX mainly) and also watching tech names like SMCI (earnings), NVDA/DELL/AMD (off of the new Deepseek news).\n\nCurrently long VXX but may kick that out at the open depending on how we open.",

Total revenue declined 9% year-over-year, with automotive revenue dropping 20% to $14B. Net income fell 71% to $409M, or $0.12 per share. The company attributed the decline to factory retooling for the refreshed Model Y, lower average selling prices, and increased sales incentives. That was a brutal earnings report, yet Trump announcing that he'll be nice to China saved the stock and pushed the entire market up. Interested in $275 and $250 levels.\n\n[**SPY**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SPY&p=d) **/** [**QQQ**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=QQQ&p=d) **/** [**VXX**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=VXX&p=d) **/ China Stocks** / **Tech Stocks**\\- President Trump signaled a potential substantial reduction in China tariffs, which currently stand at 145%. Whether this will actually hold and be his stance going forward is entirely up to him (he changed his mind a lot during 2019's trade wars). Assuming that the market holds up today, I'm primarily watching my current positions in NVDA/AAPL and ready to flip short if we make some ridiculously unsustainable move or if Trump changes his mind.\n\n[**LLY (Eli Lilly)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=LLY&p=d)\\-Filed lawsuits against four telehealth companies for selling unauthorized compounded versions of its GLP-1 drugs, Mounjaro and Zepbound. (LLY's diabetes drug Mounjaro went into short supply in 2022, allowing pharmacies and outsourcing facilities to produce the treatment, a practice called compounding). These drugs generated over $16.4B in revenue last year. Interestingly enough I see this case as pretty major despite not moving the stock significantly today, deciding whether GLP-1 is essentialy \"genericized\" to the point where any company can sell it or only the original developers of the drug. NVO might face the same thing in the future. If LLY loses, that's a huge blow for both of them.\n\n[**HTZ (Hertz)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=HTZ&p=d)\\-The potential rollback of tariffs by the Trump administration could negatively impact Ackman's thesis that used cars are more valuable due to tariffs. The stock is nearing $9, the previous high when the tariff news was announced. I'm interested in shorting the stock if we make a parabolic move up or if we fail to break $9 (but as always, it's dependent on how we get there). Automotive rental companies have benefited from higher used car values amid tariff-induced supply constraints. \n\n**Earnings today:** IBM",

    "selftext": "I keep seeing this recurring bearish argument that \u201cmore efficient models\u201d like DeepSeek will reduce the need for massive compute, and therefore hurt Nvidia. That thesis simply doesn\u2019t hold up to scrutiny \u2014 especially in light of OpenAI\u2019s latest announcement today.\n\nTake a look at the AIME performance chart from OpenAI\u2019s new frontier model (o3). It shows a\u00a0**direct, consistent correlation between compute usage and model performance**. More compute = better models. Full stop. No tricks, no shortcuts.\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/MU2z77b](https://imgur.com/a/MU2z77b)\n\nYes, we\u2019re seeing architectural improvements that increase training efficiency. But these gains don\u2019t shrink the pie \u2014\u00a0**they expand it**. Every efficiency gain is reinvested into building even larger and more capable models. This is the scaling law trend, and Nvidia is at the center of it.\n\nNow to DeepSeek: impressive optimization work, but let\u2019s be real \u2014 their model is just riding on top of the massive foundation Nvidia enabled. DeepSeek\u2019s \u201cefficiency\u201d is only relevant because\u00a0**they still needed access to high-end GPUs to train it in the first place**. No one is training SOTA on CPUs or low-cost commodity hardware. Every frontier model \u2014 whether from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, or DeepSeek \u2014 relies on Nvidia\u2019s stack to get off the ground.\n\nHere\u2019s the bullish reality:\n\n* Model performance still scales with compute \u2014 OpenAI just showed us that again.\n* Efficient models don\u2019t kill GPU demand; they unlock\u00a0**even more ambitious models**\u00a0and\u00a0**more widespread deployments**.\n* Inference is exploding. Every assistant, every copilots, every agent\u2026 all of them need sustained GPU access.\n* Nvidia has built a full-stack moat: CUDA, TensorRT, networking, and ecosystem lock-in.\n\nThe smarter argument isn\u2019t that Nvidia demand will fall \u2014 it\u2019s that demand will\u00a0**explode in more directions**: training, inference, on-device, edge. Efficient models don\u2019t reduce Nvidia\u2019s relevance. They increase the number of use cases and drive\u00a0**horizontal expansion**\u00a0of AI compute.",

I am targeting potentially good candidates for short-term trading; I have no opinion on them as investments. The potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting, everything else is secondary.\n\nNews: [China Tells Airlines Stop Taking Boeing Jets As Trump Tariffs Expand Trade War](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-15/china-tells-airlines-stop-taking-boeing-jets-as-trump-tariffs-expand-trade-war)\n\n[**NVDA (Nvidia)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&p=d)\\- Nvidia announced it expects a $5.5B charge in Q1 2026 due to new U.S. export restrictions on its H20 AI chips to China. These chips were lobotomized versions initially designed to comply with earlier export controls but are now subject to stricter licensing requirements under the Trump administration's policies. I'm mainly interested if NVDA breaks $100 to the downside. The semis industry is volatile due to escalating U.S.-China trade tensions, affecting AMD and INTC (not as much) as well. Export policy volatility regarding semis exports will likely be in flux rather than having some kind of set policy and affect global AI chip demand. He who controls the spice controls the universe!!!!\n\n[**IBKR (Interactive Brokers)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=IBKR&p=d)\\- Reported Q1 adjusted EPS of $1.88 vs $1.92 expected. Revenue of $1.43B vs $1.42B expected. Despite the earnings miss, they announced a 28% dividend increase and a 4-for-1 stock split effective mid-July. Most of these brokerages have been selling off from the market peak around mid Feb, but I don't consider these to be interesting at the moment for outperformance, unless they fall further. Risks to watch out for in these include decreasing retail trading activity, fee compression, and competition from zero-commission platforms. (Also worth noting HOOD also fell from the Feb market peak)\n\n[**META (Meta)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=META&p=d)\\- Zuck testified in an FTC antitrust trial about Meta's acquisition of Instagram, with internal emails suggesting shady motives. The FTC alleges the moves were to neutralize competition and monopolize the social media space. We've had a significant selloff for the past 2 months from 750 to 500, and while not extremely liquid due to price/volume, it's still worth pursuing if there is some catalyst for a forced sale of Instagram (unlikely). Risks include potential breakup rulings (this is the white whale trade), broader regulatory clampdowns, and increased oversight of tech M&A (we've seen less M&A already this year in the Trump admin mainly due to volatility).\n\n[**ASML (Advanced Semiconductor Materials Lithography)-**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=ASML&p=d)  Reported Q1 net sales of \u20ac7.74B vs \u20ac7.8B expected, and net profit of \u20ac2.36B vs \u20ac2.3B expected. **Net bookings came in at \u20ac3.94B vs \u20ac4.89B expected, well below forecasts.** CEO flagged tariff-related uncertainty as a key risk to forward demand. Order shortfall is a bad sign (and also an explanation for why the rest of the semis fell as well). I typically don't trade super high priced stocks like this due to the spread but ultimately interested if we fall further to last week's levels (\\~$600).",

Interested in MP's $30 level. Rare earth metals are important because they're used in technology, electronics, defense, and literally everything with a computer, with China controlling over 80% of all REMs. It is noteworthy that China entirely refines these metals and produces 90% of the global supply of these magnets. We're back in BLOPS2 baby! \n\n[**BA (Boeing)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=BA&p=d)\\-China has ordered its airlines to suspend deliveries of Boeing jets and halt purchases of aircraft-related equipment and parts from U.S. companies, a direct response to the U.S. imposing tariffs as high as 145% on Chinese goods. Interested in the $150 level. China is a significant market for BA, accounting for a substantial portion (20%!) of its projected deliveries over the next two decades. Despite being far smaller in comparison to Airbus, BA's planes are reserved years in advance, making it difficult for China to avoid using U.S. planes.\n\n[**BULL (Webull Corporation)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=BULL&p=d)\\-Webull Corporation completed a reverse merger with SK Growth Opportunities Corporation and is finally listed after delaying their IPO for years. Overall not interested in this unless we break yesterday's highs, as the price 8x'ing seems ludicrous for a company that should be priced relatively easily (because we have comparables such as HOOD/other brokerages). I'm biased negatively on this stock today.\n\n[**NVDA (Nvidia)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&p=d)\\-Nvidia has announced plans to invest up to $500B in building AI supercomputers entirely in the United States. This initiative includes establishing over a million square feet of manufacturing space in Texas, partnering with companies like Foxconn and Wistron. This seems like a play to avoid getting semis tariffed, although the outcome is uncertain, especially with Trump announcing upcoming tariffs in a month or two. Overall see a lot more uncertainty in this stock and AAPL, so extremely important to be aware of the tariff narrative.\n\n**E**arnings: IBKR/UAL",

Positions: Cash + protectionist plays (INTC, X, etc). \n\nWell, this ended up becoming a little trilogy. The market has went down, a lot, and the big question is: \n\nIs this time to buy?\n\nI think so. I have been, over Thursday and Friday. \n\nWhy?\n\n1. Because these tariffs are bad. They are so bad that, if unchanged, they will cause not only a recession, but I think there will be riots on the streets within 6 months. \n\n2. Trump -- and the republican party -- are on a timer. Midterms are next year. They need to show results, not a crashing economy. Republicans are already starting to voice discontent. Ted Cruz *openly* stated this could be a \"political bloodbath\". If tariffs stay on, republicans will break ranks. Anything else is political suicide. \n\n3. This leads me to conclude that tariffs will be removed. Either via Trump or through congressional action. Maybe even impeachment. The result? Markets moon. \n\nThis leads me to 3 scenarios: \n\n1. Tariffs end quickly via renegotiation or Trump just backing down. I mean, islands with penguins? Seriously? Trump declares victory.\n\n2. Some tariffs (China) stay, many others are removed. Certain industries benefit, others feel pain.\n\n3. Tariffs stay on long enough to necessitate public/congressional intervention. Political chaos, recession, Maga goose cooked.\n\nIn scenario 1 and 2, damage is limited and markets ascend quickly. Remember, most gains come from certain days. \nIn scenario 3, damage includes a recession. Earnings go down and valuations may retreat to ~16, which is ~4400 on the S&P. We are at 5070 now.\n\nI'm deploying 80% of cash to buy. Keeping 20% safe, just in case.\n\nSo far, I've bought financials (KRE, WAL), tech (INTC, NVDA, META), retailers (NKE, RH) and SPY. Also, some LCID and RKLB for funsies. \n\nIs this the low? I don't know. China and the EU can wait Trump out, I think. Standing up to Trump and tariffs will be domestically popular for them. Which means they will not renegotiate. Which means action must come from the US. \n\nBut, sitting on cash for too long is foolish, unless you live in Omaha. Spy has already fallen from 613 in Feb when I went short; and from 560 in March when I went cash. Things are now a lot more attractive. \n\nTo summarize my theory, I hope that the adults in Washington step up, stop executive overreach, and we all benefit. It might take some time. I suggest writing to your representatives in Congress. I have.\n\nWhat do you guys think?",

I am targeting potentially good candidates for short-term trading; I have no opinion on them as investments. The potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting, everything else is secondary.\n\n**China announced a 34% tariff on the US. The US may retaliate. \"Reciprocal\" tariffs can result in a positive feedback loop of the tariff percentage.**\n\nNews: [China Imposes 34 Tariffs On All Us Imports As Retaliation](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-04/china-imposes-34-tariffs-on-all-us-imports-as-retaliation)\n\n**AVGO, NXPI, LRCX, AMAT- ALL OF THESE COMPANIES HAVE 20%+ OF THEIR SALES COME FROM CHINA)**\\- China imposing a 34% tariff on US imports escalates trade tensions and impacts supply chains, all of which have significant exposure to China. Overall, most interested in NVDA at $95/$90 and possibly INTC at $20 if we don't spike off the open. I'm leaning more bearish for today due to the news being announced so early premarket from China, and also from the fear of the US announcing additional tariffs.\n\n[**AAPL (Apple)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AAPL&p=d)\\- AAPL broke $200 premarket following the announcement- mainly due to approximately 20% of AAPL revenue comingfrom China. I'm interested mainly if it breaks $190 intraday. AAPL relies heavily on China for manufacturing, with over 90% of its production based there and newly imposed tariffs are expected to increase AAPL\u2019s annual costs by $8.5B. China adding more tariffs affects AAPL as it is clearly the biggest MAG7 loser of the tariffs. Main risks involve increased production costs, potential price hikes for consumers, and a possible decline in sales volume because our damn phones get far more expensive. Additionally, further escalation in trade tensions could lead to more severe supply chain disruptions. \n\n[**VXX (VIX Short-Term Futures ETN)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=VXX&p=d)\\- I still don't think we've peaked (as I mentioned yesterday). We've spiked to \\~$40 on the VIX ($75 on VXX). I'm interested in seeing how the US will respond to China tariffs before making any significant trades. The risk in the VXX short is based on overnight headlines from China announcing more tariffs (which already happened), and now, waiting for the US to retaliate. Fun.\n\n[**BABA (Alibaba)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=BABA&p=d)**,** [**FXI (China Large-Cap ETF)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=FXI&p=d)**,** [**YINN (China Bull 3X Shares)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=YINN&p=d)**,** [**YANG (China Bear 3X Shares)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=YANG&p=d)**,** [**JD (JD.com)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=JD&p=d)\\- China-related stocks are selling off due to expectations of retaliation from the US. Also currently just a \"watch\", everything hinges on if the US backs off from tariffs or if we escalate. Interested in BABA if it hits $100. If the US announces escalation of tariffs, I'm mainly interested in a YANG buy. This is potentially the largest catalyst since COVID, so one tweet can move the market.\n\nPlease remember YINN/YANG are not meant to be held intraday.",

The largest risk, according to analysts, centers on the iPhone maker's overseas production hubs, which are particularly vulnerable to the tariffed countries.\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump announced tariffs that will impact some 185 countries, including the United States's largest trading partners. Additional reciprocal tariffs, for instance, will include 34% tariffs on Chinese imports, a 20% tariff on European Union imports, a 46% tariff on imports from Vietnam, 32% on imports from Taiwan, and 26% on India \u2014 all set to take effect on April 9.\n\nNotably, the additional 34% tax on China will be added to the country's existing 20% tariff, meaning its total tariff rate will rise to 54%. China is Apple's most important\u00a0[production hub](https://www.businessinsider.com/tim-cook-apple-supply-chain-trump-tariffs-china-diversify-iphone-2025-1?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=yahoo.com), with about 85% of its iPhones manufactured there.\n\n\"Apple produces basically all their iPhones in China, and the question will be around exceptions and exemptions on this tariff policy if those companies are building more operations, factories, and plants in the US[\u00a0like Apple announced in February](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/02/apple-will-spend-more-than-500-billion-usd-in-the-us-over-the-next-four-years/),\" Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said in a note to clients following the announcement.\n\nAs trade tensions escalate, Apple has moved to increase its supply chain beyond just China, boosting manufacturing in places like India and Vietnam. But with the new tariff announcements set to impact those countries too, there's now limited room for reprieve.\n\n\"The worry will be around pricing and margin impacts along with what this means for the global supply chain looking forward,\" Ives said. For now, the analyst continues to believe major negotiations will happen over the coming months as companies attempt to navigate \"this new world of tariffs.\"\n\nUntil then, he warned, \"tech stocks will clearly be under major pressure.\"\n\nOther Magnificent Seven players also faced significant selling action. In aggregate, that cohort of stocks is currently on track to eliminate over $800 billion from their collective market caps.\n\nIn afternoon trade, Amazon ([AMZN](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMZN)) and Nvidia ([NVDA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NVDA)) each fell 7%, followed by a 6% drop in both Alphabet ([GOOGL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOGL)) and Tesla ([TSLA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA)). Meta ([META](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/META)) dipped 3%, while Microsoft ([MSFT](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MSFT)) was off just under 2%.\n\nOutside of the Mag Seven, chip stocks faced similar declines, despite the exemption of semiconductors from Trump's additional tariffs. Nvidia competitor Broadcom ([AVGO](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AVGO)), for example, erased well over $50 billion from its market cap following an 8% drop in shares.\n\n\"The implications \\[of the announced tariffs\\] are broad-reaching, and we see negative implications for the whole \\[chip\\] sector,\" KeyBanc analyst John Vinh wrote in a note to clients. \"These are most notably going to negatively impact end-demand in key markets including smartphones/iPhones and PCs, as a significant amount of manufacturing is done within China.\"\n\nStacy Rasgon, Bernstein's managing director and senior analyst, added in an interview with Yahoo Finance that the biggest headwind for semiconductors is not necessarily the direct impact of tariffs. Rather, it's the risk of demand destruction as these products become more expensive.\n\nHe added, \"The other risk for semis is that they are very cyclical, very global, and very correlated to the macro and to GDP.\u00a0[So if this tips us into recession,\u00a0](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/us-economy-dangerously-vulnerable-to-recession-wall-street-reacts-to-tariff-fallout-155837444.html)that's probably not going to be great.\"",

I am targeting potentially good candidates for short-term trading; I have no opinion on them as investments. The potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting, everything else is secondary.\n\n**Stay agile, and be on the lookout for tariff news from Beijing.**\n\nNews: [Trump's Tariff Announcement](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/live-blog/2025-04-02/trump-s-tariff-announcement)\n\n[**AAPL (Apple)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AAPL&p=d)\\- 34% tariff on Chinese imports, adding to existing duties, brings the total to 54% effective April 9. AAPL relies heavily on Chinese manufacturing, and these tariffs are expected to lead to increased production costs, which will be passed on to consumers through higher prices. Watching $200, but likely the stock I'm going to play if there's any chance of a bounce (in addition to NVDA). These tariffs will result in retaliatory measures from China, further impacting Apple's supply chain and profitability. Additionally, prolonged tariffs could lower consumer demand due to higher prices. Related Tickers: AVGO, SWKS, TSM, QCOM.\n\n[**CRWV (CoreWeave)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=CRWV&p=d)\\- Google is reportedly in advanced discussions to rent Nvidia's Blackwell AI servers from CoreWeave. This potential partnership is huge because it means that CRWV has a little more diversification in their revenue stream (alleviating a huge risk to the company). It's hard, this has risen so much from the IPO but we're back at pre-tariff and pre-announcement prices- have a small long position but likely will exit due to all the craziness today and need to focus on the bigger fish. Despite Taiwanese chips not being tariffed, CRWV will likely benefit due to the rising costs of chips.\n\n[**RH (Restoration Hardware)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=RH&p=d)\\- Reported EPS of $1.58 vs $1.92 expected. Revenue of $812M vs $829M. The company issued guidance for the current fiscal year, projecting revenue growth of 10% to 13%, an adjusted operating margin between 14% and 15%, and an adjusted EBITDA margin of 20% to 21%. Management highlighted concerns over a higher-risk business environment due to tariffs, market volatility, and inflation risks, noting that RH has been operating in the \"worst housing market in almost 50 years.\" Interested at $150, but won't focus on this today vs AAPL or other Mag7 names that are selling off.\n\n[**VXX (VIX Short-Term Futures ETN)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=VXX&p=d)\\- The recent spike in volatility attributed to \"Liberation Day\" saw a massive VIX spike along with everything else selling off. Interested in seeing what we do but I doubt today will be the day I take a short position- volatility is coming and is not as likely to be the quick one-day spikes we've seen in the past. We may see additional tariffs from China in retaliation.\n\n[**NKE (Nike)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NKE&p=d)\\- Nike is one of the biggest losers due to tariffs, as a substantial portion of its manufacturing is based in Southeast Asian countries facing high tariff rates. Notably, Nike produces nearly 50% of its footwear and 30% of its apparel in Vietnam. Currently long, but will bail if we break new lows (\\~$55.20). Prolonged tariffs lead to higher consumer prices, and NKE has cited lowered demand/guidance for its goods due to competitors.\n\n[**NVDA (NVIDIA)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&p=d)\\- NVIDIA's exposure to the recent tariff announcements appears limited, as the 32% levy on imports from Taiwan. The White House clarified that semis are exempt from these tariffs, which provides a buffer for NVIDIA's core business and limits downside risk from the new trade measures. We still saw a 6% move post-tariff announcement.",

    "selftext": "BARRON'S\n\nNvidia Stock Is Falling. Not Even Chip Exemption Saves It From Broad Slump.\n\n2:28 PM-Apr 3\n\nNVDA\n\nBy Adam Clark\n\nNvidia looks set to fall sharply following President Donald Trump's imposition of sweeping tariffs on imports to the U.S. The chip maker escaped specific levies but the wider market reaction and fears of Chinese retaliation are set to drag on the shares.\n\nNvidia shares were down 3.2% at $106.93 in the Thursday premarket having tumbled 5.7% at $104.15 in after-hours trading. The stock rose 0.3% during Wednesday's session.\n\nThe tariff announcement wasn't quite as bad as it could have been for Nvidia. Trump said the levy on imports for Taiwan - where Nvidia's chips are mostly manufactured - will be set at 32%. However, the White House published a fact sheet after Trump's announcement that said semiconductors would not be subject to that reciprocal tariff.\n\nThat doesn't mean chip tariffs are off the table entirely. Products such as semiconductors, pharmaceuticals and lumber will be addressed separately, a senior administration official said.\n\nThe other major concern is likely to be potential retaliation from Beijing, with Chinese goods now facing total duties of 54% after the latest tariff announcements.\n\nAmong other chip makers, Advanced Micro Devices fell 5.8% in after-hours trading and Broadcom was down 6.3%.\n\nMeanwhile, Nvidia on Wednesday said its Blackwell computing platform set performance records in tests for inferencing - the process of generating output from Al models - carried out by MLCommons, an open engineering consortium.\n\nThere has been speculation over whether Nvidia's dominant position in Al chips would weaken as the focus shifts from training Al models to inference. The company has pushed back hard against that, noting inference makes up around 40% of its data-center revenue and is growing fast. It says that its NVL72 server system delivers a fourfold improvement in Al model training but up to a 30 times improvement in inference compared with previous systems.\n\nThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

    "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nI know absolutely nothing about investing. My understanding is just: I buy stocks, they can go up or down, and I either make or lose money.\n\nOn January 6th, I bought 73 shares of NVIDIA. I had heard from friends that they made good money with it, so I thought I\u2019d try it too.\n\nI\u2019m from Brazil, and I paid BRL 1,381.61. Now my investment is worth BRL 951.92 \u2014 that\u2019s a loss of BRL 429.24.\n\nLooking at the chart on Google, it seems like I got unlucky and bought right before it dropped.\n\nMy question is: should I just accept the loss and take my money out before it drops more? Or should I leave it there and hope for the best?\n\nI honestly have no clue what might happen next, and to be honest, I\u2019m not really interested in learning more about investing \u2014 I just want to make a reasonable decision here.\n\nThanks in advance!\n\nEDIT: Based on the comments, I think it's important to clarify that I didn't have any specific goal with this investment \u2014 I just wanted to grow my money over the long term. I was aware of the risk of losing money, so I only invested an amount I was comfortable with potentially losing. From what I've read in the comments, it seems like holding onto these shares for the long term might actually be a good idea (Apparently even buying more haha).",

I am targeting potentially good candidates for short-term trading; I have no opinion on them as investments. The potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting, everything else is secondary.\n\nNews: [US Stock Futures Tumble Ahead Of New Trump Tariffs: Markets Wrap ](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-30/us-stock-futures-tumble-ahead-of-new-trump-tariffs-markets-wrap)\n\n[**SPY**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SPY&p=d)**,** [**QQQ** ](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=QQQ&p=d)**,** [**VXX** ](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=VXX&p=d)**,** [**USO**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=USO&p=d) , larger tech stocks - \"Liberation day\" (additional tariffs) is nearing, causing the market to selloff due to fears of escalating trade tensions and potential global growth impacts . We're pretty close to near lows from 3/13 (18 days ago, lol). \n\nOverall will be trying to buy a bounce for a day trade if we do end up breaking, but probably will be more focused on a VXX short rather than buying the market overall. I'm interested if we selloff or pop on the open, if we break new lows I may short/then flip long. This kind of headline-driven macro environment is a pain in the ass to keep track of, but creates a lot more opportunity for short-term trading. Risks that can change the tariff narrative or move the market include unexpected retaliation from trade partners, weakening consumer/investor confidence (like last week's numbers), and spillover into energy and commodity prices (Trump has signaled some action on oil, but we aren't sure what yet). \n\n**NVDA**[ **(Nvidia)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&p=d)\\- Another interesting thing that caught my eye this morning are reports from Chinese media that NVDA's new chip (GB300) are significantly delayed due to complexity and may be a quarter or two delayed (thus resulting in missed/delayed revenue). This could explain why NVDA is down significantly more (-3.5%) vs other semis. \n\n[**TSLA (Tesla)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TSLA&p=d) \\- Analysts have trimmed Q1 delivery estimates for TSLA amid weakening demand trends and delays in its Model Q vehicle (the cheap, Robotoaxi car). There have also been articles of divestment from pension/investing funds that are invested in TSLA that I've read, but whether those are serious, I'd hold judgement on. \n\nDelivery numbers are expected Wednesday and typically report premarket, so good to be cognizant of that. I'm interested in seeing if we can hold below $250 today. The EV sector in general has entered a consolidation phase, with cost competition and flagging consumer incentives weighing on demand, and BYD is hot on TSLA's heels and likely going to overtake TSLA within the year. Below-consensus deliveries could spark a guidance reset for earnings, margin compression of their other cars due to the Model Q, and market share loss in China and Europe are key concerns. Also random people torching Tesla dealerships.\n\n[**PLTR (Palantir Technologies Inc.)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=PLTR&p=d) \\- No material news catalyst, but PLTR has experienced five consecutive red sessions and is likely moving with the overall stock rout. Worth noting that PLTR cut close to 60% of its IT Team (said by CTO in recent interview), and DoD cut close to $600M in spending (which affects PLTR). Also worth noting that we are EXACTLY right back to where we started before we had significant retail interest in this stock ($80). The broader AI/data analytics sector has seen a pullback after a multi-month run and has been somewhat outpaced rational valuation so not too interested in this for the long term. ",

    "title": "CoreWeave, the biggest IPO of 2025. (DD on $CRWV)",
    "selftext": "# I love IPOs.\n\nThe last IPO I thought was amazing was ARM (and how far we've come!).  Coreweave (IPOing on the 28th!) is another one I think has a ton of potential. (I wrote the majority of this before the reduced IPO sizing so please forgive me if my math is incorrect).\n\nCoreWeave is a cloud infrastructure provider specializing in GPU computing, called an \u201cAI hyperscaler.\u201d They run data centers full of GPUs and rent out that computing power to customers via the cloud. Similar to AWS/Azure, but they're focused on AI/ML/GPU tasks like making stupid Studio Ghibli pictures of yourself.\n\nCRWV started in 2017 mining ETH but pivoted to being a GPU farm in 2019 after the crash. By 2022, they fully exited crypto mining and doubled down on enterprise GPU cloud services\u200b. This early mover advantage in GPU hosting, (along with all the GPUs they bought from NVDA), have made it a player in the the cloud services space.\n\nCRWV makes money by charging for usage-based cloud compute - clients pay for GPU hours on their servers.\u200b Initially, they served niches like VFX studios (movies like Interstellar take millions of GPU hours to render), but now AI training and inference workloads are the main growth driver\u200b.\n\nCompanies like META/IBM/MSFT have used CRWV for AI compute needs in the past\u200b. CRWV's differentiator is through software- they claim custom scheduling software (e.g. a system called \u201cSUNK\u201d and an optimizer \u201cTensorizer\u201d) that yields better hardware utilization, faster container spin-ups, and higher throughput than general-purpose which makes them more efficient to use.\n\nIn practice, that means a customer training a large ML model might get results faster or cheaper on CRWV than on AWS. CRWV currently operates 32 data centers with 250k+ NVDA GPUs and are very aggressive in acquiring them- they deploy A100, H100, and H200s and are prioritized as customers of NVDA.\n\n**The NVDA Relationship**\n\nNVDA backs CRWV, and they're strong partners (which means they prioritize each other over other customers). Due to this, I dismiss the possibility that CRWV will ever have troubles on the supply side of obtaining GPUs. Something that is fairly common knowledge is that NVDA (and other companies) prefer selling GPUs in bulk because it simplifies customer service and they can charge for enterprise support and  sell thousands at a time. It's also why NVDA spits on the face of their gaming customers.\n\n**Isn't it kind of shady that NVDA both invests and is a customer of CRWV? Why doesn't NVDA use their own chips instead of renting capacity from CRWV?**\n\nKind of. Nothing they've done is outright illegal (even using their GPUs as collateral is within the law). Even companies that build GPUs need to rent compute when there's a massive amount of demand. MSFT did it, NVDA did it, OpenAI WILL do it. CRWV signed a direct deal with OpenAI: a multi-year commitment up to $11.9\u202fB for GPU cloud capacity\u200b. They have ties to the major AI players. This entire DD going forward assumes that they will continue to keep their relationship with NVDA because NVDA needs them so AWS doesn't swallow the entire market. \n\n**The Financials**\n\nCRWV has had ridiculous growth- In 2022, they had revenue of $15.8\u202fM (the majority of which came from ETH mining). In 2023, their GPU computing pivot led to revenue of $229M, then $1.9B in 2024. This was obviously fueled by the release of ChatGPT as demand for GPU compute exploded as other companies scrambled to compete with their OWN LLM models.\n\nBy 2024, CRWV neared $2\u202fB in annual sales, transforming from a niche player to a major cloud provider in two years.\n\nThe financial issue is that CRWV is unprofitable as it scales. In 2023, it lost \\~$600M, and in 2024m \\~$860M. For every $1 of revenue in 2024, they spent about $1.45 for huge investments in data centers, GPUs, and the associated operating costs (plus interest on debt they've taken out which they have a ton of).\n\nThe S-1 shows operating costs close to \\~$1B from tech/infra in 2024, which includes data center space, buying/depreciating their GPUs, electricity costs, maintenance staff, etc. The capex is massive and is funded largely by debt.\n\nThe cash burn is brutal as well- at the end of 2024 CRWV still has negative FCF (which is normal for a pre-ipo high growth tech startup) and is betting that they will eventually claw their way to profitability despite the brutal looking financials (like Uber, Snowflake, Robinhood, insert your choice of tech startup here lol). The bet is that high upfront investment now will secure long-term contracts and scale to profitability later, like most tech IPOs.\n\n**Customer Concentration**\n\nIn 2023, Microsoft accounted for \\~35% of CRWV\u2019s revenue\u200b. In 2024, that grew to \\~62% of total revenue\u200b. Their S-1 mentioned that close to \\~80% of their revenue comes from two customers alone. But this is a warning sign because MSFT wants to build their own (hence their announcement of spending \\~$80B in 2025 for AI data centers).\n\n**If MSFT scales back their use of CRWV then they are frankly fucked.** MSFT's CEO also mentioned that using external capacity (like CRWV) for GPUs was a short-term stopgap until their own investment in Azure pays off.\n\nHowever, the OpenAI deal (remember that OpenAI is 49% owned by MSFT) could take the place of MSFT going forward. The contract is up to $11.9B through 2030\u200b, which averages out to \\~$2B/year if used, which is equivalent to all of CRWV's 2024 revenue.  If OpenAI maximizes their usage, CRWV\u2019s revenue could potentially double at minimum if MSFT doesn't pull out. This is a wild hopium optimistic case but I thought it was worth mentioning.\n\nBeyond those two, CRWV has other customers that make up the \\~20% of 2024 revenue). These include research labs, VFX studios, and other tech companies but none are individually as large compared to the MSFT/OpenAI. What will make or break this company in the long run is the diversification of the client base because all their eggs are in one basket.\n\n**IPO Technicals**\n\nCRWV sold 37.5M shares at $40/share, getting $1.5B and giving it a $20B valuation. That was below CRWV's official target of offering 49M shares at $47-$55, raising up to $2.7B at $32B valuation\u200b. This signals a lack of interest in the initial offering and is not great news if you already hold the stock, but is excellent if you're a short term trader that wants to see a pop on IPO day- the stock has more room to run. Yes, this means it's good for retail, bad for insiders.\n\n**Valuation/Comparables**\n\nIs a \\~$20B valuation reasonable for CRWV? You can do a rough comparison:\n\n|**Company**|Annual Revenue (2024)|**Recent Valuation**|**EV/Revenue Multiple**|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|**CoreWeave** (CRWV)|$1.92\u202fB|\\~$20B (target IPO)|\\~10\u00d7|\n|**Snowflake** (SNOW)|$3.41\u202fB\u200b|\\~$52\u202fB (market cap)|\\~15\u00d7 \u200b|\n|**Databricks**\\*|\\~$3\u202fB by end of 2025|\\~$62\u202fB \u200b|\\~20\u00d7|\n|**AWS** (AMZN)|$107.6\u202fB\u200b|\\~$500\u202fB|\\~4-5\u00d7|\n\n(That's not a typo- AWS is valued at \\~$500B, it's the main driver of AMZN's growth, yet struggles to grow because it's already massive). \\*Also note that Databricks is a private company\n\nI think that if the company can maintain a hyper-growth trajectory (e.g. 2-3\u00d7 growth for a couple more years), then an 10\u00d7 multiple now could look cheap in hindsight. For instance, 2025 revenue could hit \\~$4\u202fB+ with the OpenAI ramp and other clients. Of course, we have risks like growth decelerating, and tariffs and Trump and China that could come in and decimate growth. And of course, they're not profitable (for now). Ironically, CRWV and other US firms would BENEFIT from chip restrictions because they'd be prioritized over the overseas ones that use NVDA chips.\n\nCRWV\u2019s valuation is aggressive (dare I say fair for a hyperscaler), but in line  with other cloud providers. The entire short term bull thesis depends on them retaining MSFT as a customer and also keeping OpenAI- if that occurs then investing in it now looks like a no-brainer. If not, **it's completely possible we see an 50%+ selloff. I think that's the reason why we're seeing such hesitancy in this valuation.**\n\nThis valuation is also dependent on entirely dependent on AI spending GROWING, society seeing greater integration in AI (more than we have now), and AI firms willing to continue spending on compute they can't harness themselves. We are still supply constrained on GPUs in general, and if we ever experience NVDA building more GPUs than there is demand for, then Coreweave's margins are threatened and profitability can vanish. For now, it looks like that is unlikely to happen.\n\n**IPO Trading Details**\n\n37.5M shares is decent IPO volume so I don't expect this to be illiquid when it trades. The main things I watch for are indication price (whether there are people who want to buy the print of the stock higher than what we IPO at) and share paired (which somewhat signal when the IPO will open for trading).\n\nOverall, this is a pure AI play on GPU compute, a bet that demand for GPUs will continue to outstrip supply,  and that MSFT/OpenAI/every other tech firm involved won't slit their throat in in the eternal game of thrones that is capitalism.\n\n**TL;DR:** There's a hell of a lot of risk, but I like the stock. It's completely possible it could open and sell off because the insiders just want to bail. It's possible that it skyrockets. Anything is possible in the wild and crazy world of IPO trading.\n\nSource:\n\n[Majority of it came from S-1 on the SEC site](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1769628/000119312525044231/d899798ds1.htm), the rest from other random tech sites and background knowledge of cloud hyperscalers.",

EPS beat estimates, and the company announced it would integrate Bitcoin into its treasury reserve. This confirms prior speculation tied to Ryan Cohen\u2019s meeting with Strategy\u2019s chairman.\u00a0**This is a massive catalyst**\u00a0solely based on the fact that if GME buys enough of the CC, we may see it trade at a premium the same way as MSTR does. (MSTR usually trades at a 2x valuation to the amount of CC it holds.). Volatility in the CC market could create swings in reported earnings, but makes GME easier to track price-wise. The core retail business still saw a 28% Y/Y decline in sales which is somewhat of a red flag. Biased positive.\n\n**Related Tickers:**\u00a0MSTR, COIN\n\n[**TSLA (Tesla)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TSLA&p=d)\\- Second day of straight gains, with shares up 3.5% after a close to 50% selloff. I'm Interested in $290 level after failing to break above it in the premarket. EV sentiment remains mixed for TSLA going forward- despite weakness in European sales, investor sentiment appears to be shifting positive. Sales in Europe fell 40% Y/Y, and Canada\u2019s EV rebate freeze adds regulatory actions into the mix. BYD is also close to overtaking TSLA, so I still don't consider this investible for the long-term (but it is tradable).\n\n[**DLTR (Dollar Tree)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=DLTR&p=d)**-**\u00a0DLTR will divest its Family Dollar segment for \\~$1B to Brigade Capital and Macellum, a massive markdown from the $9B it paid in 2015. The stock reacted fairly positively on this news, mainly because DLTR has been struggling since COVID. This move is an effort to clean up the balance sheet and refocus on the core business. The market probably views this favorably in the face of tariffs - less potential exposure to Family Dollar inevitably underperforming.\n\n**Related Tickers:**\u00a0DG\n\n[**NVDA (NVIDIA)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&p=d)\\- New energy rules in China disqualify NVDA's exportable H20 chip, threatening near-term revenue from a key market. Seen a minor selloff in NVDA of roughly $2, interested to see if we sell off more at the open. China\u2019s energy mandates are squeezing data center hardware providers, forcing chipmakers to adapt or lose access to the market. Having the H20 not be usable is a huge blow to NVDA's revenue, as it makes up close to 10% of their revenue in 2024. More regulation or bans could further limit access to Chinese demand, other chipmakers, etc. This DOES seem targeted to have Chinese companies focus on\n\n**Related Tickers:**\u00a0AMD, INTC, QCOM",

    "selftext": "\nMajor indexes closed slightly higher Tuesday as the stock market continued its recovery from an extended selloff.\n\nThe S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite added 0.2% and 0.5%, respectively, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose fractionally. Stocks had kicked off the week with big gains following news that President Trump could scale back some of the tariffs that are due to be imposed next week on U.S. trading partners. With the recent gains, the Dow has inched back into positive territory for 2025, as stocks have rebounded from a month-long selloff spurred by concerns about the potential impact of tariffs and uncertainty about the outlook for the economy.\n\nInvestors brushed off consumer confidence data released this morning that came in weaker than expected, with the index hitting its lowest level in more than four years. Investors are closing watching all data points amid worries that tariffs could reignite inflation and cause economic growth to stall. The big economic report of the week comes Friday with the scheduled release of the Federal Reserve's preferred measure of inflation.\n\nThe yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which had fallen during the recent stock market rout amid the growing concerns about the economy, was at 4.32% in late trading, down from 4.33% at yesterday's close and from an earlier high Tuesday of 4.37%. The yield, which affects costs on all sorts of loans, notably mortgages, hit its highest level in more than a month this morning.\n\nMega-cap technology stocks, which helped lead Monday's rally, were mostly higher again today. Shares of Tesla (TSLA) rallied late in the day to finish 3.5% higher, gaining ground for the 5th consecutive session, despite news Tuesday that the EV maker's sales in Europe continued to slide. Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN) and Meta Platforms (META) each rose more than 1%, while Microsoft (MSFT) inched ahead. Chipmakers Nvidia (NVDA) and Broadcom (AVGO) closed slightly lower\n\n\n\nhttps://www.investopedia.com/dow-jones-today-03252025-11702763",

My question, \u201cShould I pull out of at least my M7 (already cashed out TSLA) from the market to cash and reenter well after April 6th?\u201d  So at this point I\u2019m up on all my long term stocks ranging from 39% to 167% as I\u2019ve been is a long time. So nothing would be at a loss. I just feel we are facing a man made intentional potential crash of US stocks. Could be short term or long term. One issue, I\u2019m also near retirement age so I don\u2019t have 20 years to wait for a correction. \nLet me further say all my eggs are not in one basket. I\u2019m fully diversified with only 1/3 of my liquid assets in stock. Because of my age 2/3 is in very safe such as CD\u2019s near 5%. Also 2 houses paid off, nice car paid off, zero debt on credit cards paid off monthly. \nBut I can\u2019t make a misstep. My portfolio will be 1/2 of the income I will rely on for income in a few years. \n\n\nI know we are not supposed to make rash decisions based on \u201cfeelings\u201d but it\u2019s more than that, I\u2019m reading nonstop everything about this market and as an older person I feel like I\u2019m seeing a potential 2008 all over again. I wisely went cash then. And in 2010 bought my house for only  42% of it was valued in 2006. Now it\u2019s worth 5 times what I paid for it. \n\nSo anyone who has weathered a few markets, what\u2019s your take? Is cashing out Apple,Amazon,NVDA for instance a crazy move right now? ",

Revenue of $11.3B vs. $11.02B expected. Despite beating expectations, sales/profits declined YoY in NA/China/Online. NKE gave a negative earnings outlook, and stated Q4 revenue would decline low-to-mid-teens (10-15%), mainly due to margin pressure from new tariffs. Pretty brutal move. I remember earnings from last year were pretty bad mainly due to weaker demand in China/Online segments. Overall a victim of tariffs, I don't consider this investible for now but things will change if we get any new news regarding tariffs, which are the main headwinds here. IIRC 25% of NKE's shoes are made in China.\n\n[**NIO**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NIO&p=d)**-** Revenue of $2.7B in Q4 2024. Vehicle deliveries rose 45.2% YoY (including Onvo vehicles). Net loss widened to RMB 7.11B, a 32.5% YoY increase. Despite the increase in cars sold, they suffered a loss of \\~$1B. They've never been profitable since they've started, so reading a little deeper into their reports, there's still concern about liquidity due to current liabilities being higher than current assets this year (a very bad sign when you want to borrow). They cited EV demand in China remains strong, especially in the premium BEV segment. NIO holds a 40% market share in the $40K-$50K car segment (I'm rounding here after conversion).\n\n[**NVDA (NVIDIA)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&p=d)**/Quantum Computing stocks**\\- Announces that they will be building a quantum lab in Boston. This has moved all the quantum computing stocks to the downside- obviously NVDA has market power in whatever industry they want to enter and compete in and most companies interested in quantum computing will likely prefer their services over the rest of the smaller players. Was the \"quantum computing is a decade away\" comment a brutal play to make the quantum computing sector weaker before his entry? If so, then bravo, that's Game of Thrones worthy scheming.\n\n[**AAL (American Airlines)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AAL&p=d)**,** [**UAL (United Airlines)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=UAL&p=d)**,** [**JBLU (JetBlue Airways)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=JBLU&p=d)\\- London Heathrow fire triggered power outage, delaying around 1,300 flights. Operational impact could cause a minor selloff in airlines that have heavy presence there. Nothing too interesting I'm watching, but I think it's worth noting if we see continued slowdowns and ripple effects from this.  Delays and reroutes raise operational costs (like we saw in the CRWD outages affecting airlines last year).",

    "selftext": "Short sellers have been cleaning up to start 2025 amid a massive sell-off in some of the market's most popular names over the past two years.\n\nShort sellers have made a combined $15 billion betting against Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA) stock thus far this year, according to data from S3 Partners. Tesla shorts alone have raked in nearly $11 billion, while bets against Nvidia have brought in more than $4 billion.\n\nTesla's 40% year-to-date drop has led the declines of the so-called Magnificent Seven stocks. Investors have grown concerned about CEO Elon Musk's focus on government efficiency efforts and how his role with President Trump's administration could be a turnoff to the electric vehicle maker's customer base.\n\nBut it hasn't just been Tesla lagging. As an index, the Magnificent Seven \u2014 which also includes Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), and Meta (META) \u2014 is underperforming the S&P 500 this quarter by the most since 2022.\n\nShort sellers have profited off of all of the names in the cohort this year. They've brought in nearly $5 billion betting against Apple stock, which is down nearly 14% in 2025.\n\nThe crash in the most popular trade of the past two years comes as investors have been re-rating their growth expectations. Fears of slowing economic growth and the impact of Trump's tariff policies have weighed on markets. Meanwhile, Big Tech has faced growing investor criticism about its ballooning AI spend and whether or not it will eventually boost future profits as much as Wall Street hopes. The year also included a massive drawdown in some large tech names, including Nvidia, following the release of a cheaper AI model from Chinese company DeepSeek.\n\nNow, with most of the names sitting around 20% off their recent 52-week highs, the looming question for markets is whether or not investor appetite for the stocks that led the market higher for the past two years will return.\n\n\"Maybe these tech stocks got ahead of their skis a little bit,\" BMO Capital Markets chief investment strategist Brian Belski told Yahoo Finance last week. \"But at the end of the day, these are monster companies that define the growth trajectory for the United States stock market. They are not going away.\"\n\n[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/short-sellers-have-made-15-billion-betting-against-tesla-and-nvidia-in-2025-164652312.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/short-sellers-have-made-15-billion-betting-against-tesla-and-nvidia-in-2025-164652312.html)",

We saw INTC make a decent bounce in the overnight yesterday on that news, but it looks like we're giving back most of those gains. This move comes as Intel faces significant losses in its manufacturing division, the CHIPS Act is targeted by Trump, so frankly a very good positive catalyst but I don't expect much to come of this. The possibility of a joint venture between these 4 companies actually happening seems fantastical, especially with Trump stating that he wants to scrap the CHIPS Act and instead work on tariffs on semis. \n\n[**RDDT (Reddit Inc.)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=RDDT&p=d)\n\nLoop Capital has maintained a buy rating on Reddit Inc. (RDDT), citing strong core fundamentals and a 71% year-over-year sales growth. I don't normally pay attention to these buy/sell ratings but I did notice this was during one of the worst selloffs for RDDT and the market downturn, so it was *a little* more significant than normal.  The company's stock has experienced a nearly 50% decline from recent highs within the past month. I thought this was interesting yesterday near the open so I bought some stock, overall still holding but interested to see where it goes after the open. Also worth noting, Reddit's plans to monetize its subscriber base are expected to boost revenue (I see them competing with Patreon/Substack/Onlyfans). This is overall a pretty positive catalyst, not much risk to it beyond additional negative news coming in for the broader tech sector.\n\n[**NVDA (Nvidia)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&p=d) **/** [**GOOG (Alphabet)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=GOOG&p=d)\n\nGoogle has unveiled Gemma 3, a new AI model designed for developers to create applications capable of running efficiently on various devices, including those powered by Nvidia GPUs. I'm also long NVDA a little more- GOOG hasn't pulled back as much as I expected compared to NVDA, but this is pointedly good news. We're also seeing a minor market bounce but whether that can hold is up in the air. Going to sell out if we break new lows in the market. Another model in the arms race that can be run on a SINGLE device is massive news, especially considering the model's competitiveness with Deepseek R1. This is overall positive news but there's always the chance that Deepseek releases an even better model in the future even though the $13M training costs have been debunked. \n\n**Sidenote:** Initiated a small short position in VXX after it broke above 60 (as mentioned yesterday); however, the primary focus remains on RDDT today.\n\n**Earnings:** [**ADBE**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=ADBE&p=d), [**PATH**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=PATH&p=d), [**S**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=S&p=d) ",

    "selftext": "TSMC (2330.TW), has pitched U.S. chip designers Nvidia (NVDA.O),, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD.O), and Broadcom (AVGO.O), about taking stakes in a joint venture that would operate Intel's (INTC.O), factories, according to four sources familiar with the matter.\n\nUnder the proposal, the Taiwanese chipmaking giant would run the operations of Intel's foundry division, which makes chips adapted for the needs of customers, but it would not own more than 50%, the sources said. Qualcomm (QCOM.O), has also been pitched by TSMC, according to one of the sources and a separate source.\n\nThe talks, which are at an early stage, come after U.S. President Donald Trump's administration requested TSMC, the world's leading contract chipmaker, assist in turning around the troubled U.S. industrial icon, the sources said on condition of anonymity because the talks are not public.\n\nThe details of the plan for TSMC to take no more than a 50% stake and its overtures to potential partners are being reported for the first time.\n\nAny final deal - the value of which is unclear - would need approval from the Trump administration, which does not want Intel or its foundry division to be fully foreign-owned, the sources said.\n\nIntel, TSMC, Nvidia, AMD and Qualcomm declined to comment. The White House and Broadcom did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nAt stake is the future of the U.S. chipmaking giant, whose shares have lost more than half of their value in the last year.\n\nIntel reported a 2024 net loss of $18.8 billion, its first since 1986, driven by large impairments. The foundry division's property and plant equipment had a book value of $108 billion as of December 31, according to a company filing.\n\nIntel stock rose more than 7% in premarket U.S. trading on Wednesday, while Nvidia, AMD, Broadcom and Qualcomm were up between 0.8% and 1.5%. TSMC closed about 1.8% higher in Taiwan.\n\nTrump is keen to revive Intel's fortunes, as he seeks to boost American advanced manufacturing, three of the sources said.\n\nThe sources said TSMC's joint venture pitch was made to potential backers before the Taiwanese chipmaker announced with Trump on March 3 that the company planned to make a fresh $100 billion investment in the United States that involves building five additional chip facilities there in coming years.\n\nTalks about the joint venture over Intel's foundry division have since continued, the three sources said, with TSMC looking to have more than one chip designer as a partner.\n\nMultiple companies have expressed interest in buying parts of Intel, but two of the four sources said the U.S. company has rejected discussions about selling its chip design house separately from the foundry division.\n\nQualcomm has exited earlier discussions to buy all or part of Intel, according to those people and a separate source.\n\nIntel board members have backed a deal and held negotiations with TSMC, while some executives are firmly opposed, according to two sources.\n\nIntel's contract manufacturing business, or foundry division, was a crucial part of former CEO Pat Gelsinger's effort to save Intel. Gelsinger was forced out by the board in December, which named two interim co-CEOs who have mothballed its forthcoming AI chip.\n\nAny deals between historical rivals TSMC and Intel would face major challenges and be costly and laborious. The two companies currently use vastly different processes, chemicals, and chipmaking tool setups at their factories, according to separate sources at the companies.\n\nIntel has previously had manufacturing partnerships with Taiwan's UMC (2303.TW), and Israel's Tower Semiconductor (TSEM.TA), that could offer a precedent for the two companies to operate together, but it remains unclear how such a partnership would work regarding trade manufacturing secrets.\n\nThe Taiwanese chipmaker wants potential investors in the joint venture to also be Intel advanced manufacturing customers, according to one of the sources.\n\nReuters reported last week, citing sources, that Nvidia and Broadcom are running manufacturing tests with Intel, using the company's most advanced production techniques, known as 18A. AMD is also evaluating whether Intel's 18A manufacturing process is suitable for it.\n\nBut 18A has been an area of contention in negotiations between Intel and TSMC, two sources said. During talks in February, Intel executives told TSMC that its advanced 18A manufacturing technology was superior to TSMC's 2-nanometer process, according to those sources.\n\nLink:\u00a0[https://www.reuters.com/technology/tsmc-pitched-intel-foundry-jv-nvidia-amd-broadcom-sources-say-2025-03-12/](https://www.reuters.com/technology/tsmc-pitched-intel-foundry-jv-nvidia-amd-broadcom-sources-say-2025-03-12/)",

I'm interested in NVDA if we break below 100 but again I think that we'll mainly see a small bounce today rather than breaking new lows. As for RDDT, we're 50% down from highs! Interesting swing candidate but will see how today goes. To me these are the standout stocks yesterday to trade due to recession fears. I don't really see a way out for TSLA regarding the boycotts. We've also seen a decently large move in the VIX (VXX) and we're close to above 60- I'm interested in shorting if we're above $60 but doubt we'll hit that today.\n\n[**ASAN (Asana)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=ASAN&p=d)\n\nCEO/co-founder, Dustin Moskovitz announced retirement. The company reported Q4 revenues of $188.3M, a 10% YoY increase, and issued a revenue outlook for fiscal 2026 below expectations (resulting in the drop).\n\nThat drop was close to 25%, mainly because Dustin owns close to 54% of the company, which signals a LOT of uncertainty and lack of faith in the company. Overall outlook is decently disappointing, and I'm mainly interested in it if we break $11.50 and very interested in buying $10.\n\n**Ticker:** [**AAL (American Airlines)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AAL&p=d)\n\nAAL projected a higher-than-expected Q1 loss and revised its revenue outlook downward, attributing the weaker forecast to softness in the domestic leisure segment. This is probably amplified by fears of flying, mainly due to people being terrified of all the plane accidents that have happened in 2025. Recession fears also lead to people cutting their vacations/discretionary spending and saving money, so things may get worse. Overall we're seeing a slight recovery in the premarket but still watching to see how this trades. To me airlines are one of the bigger leading signals of economic uncertainty so will continue watching. Other tickers that have moved on this are DAL, UAL, LUV.",

[I wrote a little more about my take on a different post](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1j437g9/trump_calls_for_end_to_52_billion_chips_act/) but overall more of the same (I think it's a terrible idea).\n\n**Ticker:** [**GM (General Motors)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=GM&p=d)**,** [**F (Ford Motor Company)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=F&p=d)**,** [**TSLA (Tesla)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TSLA&p=d)\n\n**Catalyst:** The Trump administration is considering granting relief from the recently imposed 25% tariffs on Canadian and Mexican imports for products that comply with the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA).\n\n**Technicals:** We've seen all three stocks (GM especially) make gains due to this announcement, will watch at open for volume.\n\n**Catalyst/Sector Context:** The automotive industry in US/Canada/Mexico involves the most economic/manufacturing cooperation in the USMCA, they're the most obvious beneficiaries of this potential catalyst.\n\n**Risks:** If they don't actually give relief, then will likely pullback- cars are one of the most affected products of tariffs and pretty much every car company has spoken about tariffs on their earnings calls.\n\n**Ticker:** [**IBIT (IBIT)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=IBIT&p=d)**,** [**COIN (Coinbase)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=COIN&p=d)**,** [**HOOD (Robinhood Markets)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=HOOD&p=d)\n\n**Catalyst:** Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has indicated that Trump plans to grant the main biggest CC a \"unique status\" within the Bitcoin reserve strategy, which will be unveiled at the White House Crypto Summit on Friday.\n\n**Technicals:** We've seen the underlying spike close to 8-9% since yesterday, watching $90K level. Interested to see how we go prior to the actual summit.\n\n**Catalyst/Sector Context:** Obviously an extremely bullish catalyst, we've bounced strongly off the $80K level recently. I usually trade through the ETFs as needed, and HOOD/Coinbase serve as proxies in case the ETFs aren't liquid or have already moved.\n\n**Risks:** Worth waiting for the catalyst and watching the CC Summit on Friday. I personally see this more of a \"buy on hype\" kind of catalyst, unless there's an announcement of something extremely bullish I'm not sure how much more this will move the needle.\n\n**Ticker:** [**HII (Huntington Ingalls Industries)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=HII&p=d)\n\n**Catalyst:** Trump has announced initiatives aimed at strengthening the U.S. shipbuilding industry to counter China's dominance, spoke about the creation of a White House Office of Shipbuilding and the introduction of special tax incentives.\n\n**Technicals:** None that I'm particularly interested in, this is a longer-term play.\n\n**Catalyst/Sector Context:** China produces over half of the world's merchant vessels, this is more of a play to reduce reliance on foreign-shipping.\n\n**Risks:** There's a chance that this will never happen, Trump tried to create a \"Cybersecurity Department\" in his first term but that was never formally created and we kept those duties spread out between the FBI/DHS/NSA. But we also have the Space Force so... stay tuned.\n\n**Earnings:** [**MRVL**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=MRVL&p=d), [**VEEV**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=VEEV&p=d), [**ZS**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=ZS&p=d), [**MDB**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=MDB&p=d)",

TSLA has been on a slide since post-election highs and frankly shows no real sign of recovery. Looking for a small bounce in this stock but I don't think there is much potential for long-term recovery.\n\n**Catalyst/Sector Context:** TSLA's EV sales have been declining in China mainly due to BYD, which are considered to make better cars for far cheaper outside the US. The US has a 100% EV tariff for non-US made EV vehicles.\n\n**Risks:** BYD has been eating TSLA's lunch outside of the US. I truly don't see TSLA retaining dominance as the EV of choice outside the US. \n\n**Ticker:** [**OKTA (Okta)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=OKTA&p=d)\n\n**Catalyst:** Okta beat earnings expectations with EPS of $.78 vs $.74,gave guidance that supports EPS of $3.20 vs $2.93. (Also note that CRWD reports today but are not direct competitors)\n\n**Technicals:** Watching $100 level.\n\n**Catalyst/Sector Context:** Cybersecurity (more specifically IAM) grows yearly mainly due to RPO and cRPO (remaining performance obligations). This is subscription backlog expected to be recognized over the next 12 months.\n\n**Risks:** Market saturation/pricing concerns from competitors.\n\n**Ticker:** [**NVDA (Nvidia)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&p=d)\n\n**Catalyst:** Nvidia is front and center as the stock most affected by tariff concerns.\n\n**Technicals:** Watching $110 level. Note that this is the lowest it's been since September 2024. We have millions of shares come in in the first 2 minutes of the open so watch for that.\n\n**Catalyst/Sector Context:** Not much to speak of that hasn't been said before, but NVDA is heavily affected by tariffs and the CHIPS Act, with additional scrutiny that it is somehow bypassing export controls and having their chips go into China.\n\n**Risks:** MORE trade disputes, more potential export restrictions, (Trump has cited he wants to strengthen export controls for NVDA).\n\n**Ticker:** [**BABA (Alibaba)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=BABA&p=d) / [FXI (iShares China Large-Cap ETF)](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=FXI&p=d) / Other Chinese Stocks\n\n**Catalyst:** China has imposed 15% retaliatory tariffs on select U.S. goods.\n\n**Technicals:** $130 level. Most interesting level I'm watching today.\n\n**Catalyst/Sector Context:** Tariffs, stimulus from the Chinese government, China has been spending for increased consumer confidence. \n\n**Risks:** Even greater tariffs, the cash cannon that China is using dies down, less spending by Chinese consumers, etc.\n\n**Related Tickers:** CRM, ZS",

    "selftext": "There's at least two possibilities: \n\n* Our divestment from Ukraine will give us more resources to deal with China militarily; or\n* We're actually signaling to China that we are not interested in defending other countries.\n\nChinese invasion of Taiwan is always on the table, but some people think what happened on Friday at the White House has just raised that possibility dramatically.\n\nFor example, Cramer wrote an article over the weekend for his paid community where he said: \n\n* \"If I was Chinese President Xi Jinping, I would immediately move militarily on Taiwan, betting that President Trump may switch sides and back China.\"\n\n* \"If you disagree with that after Friday\u2019s White House exchange with Zelenskyy, you need to soul search your position. To me, this could be a tremendous opportunity for the PRC to stop this whole game of export restrictions from the U.S. and just turn everything on its head by taking over the island and, along with it, the most important strategic asset in the world right now, Taiwan Semi.\"\n\n* \"In a world where Zelenskyy gets thrown under the bus for lack of gratitude and starting a war that he didn\u2019t start, how can we defend an allegedly ungrateful Taiwan? Perhaps because, unlike Ukraine, there is something at stake economically?\"\n\n* \"Will President Trump\u2019s advisers discuss the notion that if we care about keeping the Chinese from getting the latest and greatest Nvidia chips, we should care about Taiwan\u2019s sovereignty? Will Trump be persuaded by even cowed generals and na\u00efve national security advisers that Nvidia and Taiwan Semi are of strategic importance? Do they even know that?\"\n\nOf course Cramer is an entertainer and not a military strategist. But I'm curious what does the community think.

    "selftext": "Year after year Reddit picks the winners! I have kept a close eye on this subreddit for the last 10-15 years and have always been amazed by how ahead of the curve we are. Here is a list of stocks that have been heavily discussed over the years that have performed very well: \n\n- Tesla \n- Shopify \n- Block\n- NVDA \n- AMD \n- PLTR\n- AAPL \n- GME\n\nI know everyone in the comments is going to claim this is selection bias, but I can assure you these stocks were talked about so much it is unmistakable. People will also claim but these stocks have tanked since then! They have had significant corrections, but if you bought them when the buzz began you are still significantly in the green.  We will have to wait and see what the future holds. \n\n But what about the losers like movie pass!? Of course, some losers have been overly hyped too, but they are far less common. Also, in my opinion, the tone around stocks like movie pass is totally different than a stock like NVDA or SHOP. \n\nThe beautiful part about Reddit is you hear both sides, SHOP had a great deal of resistance back in 2017 and still does. A lot of people claimed it was a worthless company. People like Andrew Left were worshipped for shorting the company. But at the end of the day it was posted about non stop and has performed extremely well. People were also screaming from the top of the mountain that NVDA was overpriced in 2017, look where that ended up. \n\nLately it feels like we have entered a new \u201chype\u201d cycle where a lot of new names have been heavily mentioned. Similar to the hype cycle of 2016-2017 there is a lot of resistance and great discussions behind had. Here are some new names that I have noticed being posted about non stop: \n\n- RKLB\n- IONQ \n- BBAI\n- CAVA \n- LUNR\n- SMCI\n- OKLO \n- BRO\n\nI have been seeing these tickers fly around lately and see a lot of promise in them. They have performed very well in the past 6 months to a year, but we will have to wait and see where they end up in the long term. \n\nIt\u2019s a common meme to short every stock Reddit mentions, but I ultimately disagree. The hive mind is a very powerful and can seemingly predict the future. Keep in mind, the hive mind is what sets the vegas spreads. \n\nAnyway, that\u2019s my rant for the day. I am sure 75% of you will disagree with me, but again, thats why I love Reddit. Would love to hear your opinions. \n\nAlso, I have holdings in most of the companies listed. This is not financial advice. Do your own due diligence before buying any company I listed. ",

Growth was largely driven by advancements in AI (as usual).\n\nCompany said they were still demand constrained, even with export controls.\n\n**Risks:** Potential supply chain disruptions/geopolitical tensions, greater export controls as mentioned previously, and increased competition.\n\n**Related Tickers:** AMD, INTC, QCOM\n\n**Ticker:** [**APP (AppLovin)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=APP&p=d)\n\n**Catalyst:** A recent short report has been released, alleging that the company's application functions as spyware.\n\nThis follows a similar report from approximately a week ago.\n\n**Technicals:** Yesterday I was mainly interested in being long if we broke $300 and had a recovery- I read both of the short reports and they said very similar things, so I thought the selloff was overblown.\n\nBought a little below $290, still holding. Will likely bail if we break $300 again.\n\n**Catalyst/Sector Context:** APP is a mobile tech company that helps devs market/monetize their apps through mobile advertising and marketing platforms, recently announced they were using AI.\n\n**Risks:** The short report allegations are true and they essentially get banned from the Google App/Apple App Store.\n\n**Related Tickers:** SNAP, PINS, TTD\n\n**Ticker:** [**MRNA (Moderna)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=MRNA&p=d)\n\n**Catalyst:** U.S. health officials are reevaluating a $590 million contract awarded to MRNA for bird flu vaccines.\n\n**Technicals:** We saw a decent dip (roughly 5%) in MRNA afterhours yesterday, not too interested in this further unless we see further headlines about the contract being pulled completely.\n\n**Catalyst/Sector Context:** MRNA had massive growth during 2020 for being one of the main manufacturers of the COVID vaccine- right now bird flu is being touted as the next potential big pandemic to vaccinate against.\n\n**Risks:** Cancellation is the the real catalyst after this news, or if the contract is awarded to a different company.\n\n**Related Tickers:** PFE, NVAX\n\n**Ticker:** [**SNOW (Snowflake)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SNOW&p=d)\n\n**Catalyst:** SNOW beat expectations, EPS of $0.30 vs. $0.18 exp. and revenue of $986.8M vs. $957.6M exp.\n\nThe company also provided an optimistic outlook, projecting current-quarter product revenue between $955M-$960M, driven by increasing demand for AI-related products.\n\n**Technicals:** Interested in $190 level.\n\n**Catalyst/Sector Context:** SNOW is a cloud-based data warehousing company and benefits from the demand for AI/ML solutions.\n\nAI is compute intensive which means they can charge more for their services.

This is the first bank recapitalization since the global financial crisis. 10T yuan (\\~$1.4T) debt package to support local government financing and economic stability.\n\n**Technicals:** We've seen a decent upmove on a lot of Chinese stocks due to this, we'll see how the market reacts.\n\n**Catalyst/Sector Context:** China has been going through a spending crisis, and the government's decision to inject substantial capital into its major banks is a move to strengthen liquidity. This initiative aims to enhance the lending capacity of banks, support local government financing, and stabilize the broader economy. It's a (pre) bailout baby.\n\n**Risks:** This does signal that China sees economic weakness, such as lack of demand due to their real estate sector they've traditionally leaned on for consumer growth/investment. Is this a long term fix? Who knows, but it worked for the US!\n\n**Related Tickers:** JD, BIDU\n\n**Ticker: SMCI**\n\n**Catalyst:** They finally filed an hour before the deadline on the final day! Really cutting it close there lol. The company has faced\u00a0allegations of accounting irregularities. These allegations, along with a failure to file specific financial forms have been a plague for the past year on the stock price. \n\n**Technicals:** We've seen a 20% move AH, so worth watching at open to see if we move further. Other than that, watching $50/$55 level. We'll see where it goes but worth noting that we've made a significant move back to pre-delisting threat prices already.\n\n**Catalyst/Sector Context:** Was at threat of delisting from the NASDAQ but now they're safe baby.\n\n**Risks:** People getting out, or the filing being rejected/advised to resubmit. The latter is a massive catalyst but low probability.\n\nEarnings: NVDA, CRM, SNOW, AI",

(Most of their training is done on NVDA chips)\n\n**Technicals:** Mainly interested to see if we can hold above $130 for NVDA- note that earnings are tomorrow so the short-term performance of the stock hinges on that. Currently long and sold 155C to hedge my position against it.\n\n**Catalyst/Sector Context:** We've seen the CHIPS act actually affect the way that semiconductor companies sell to China- most of those restrictions are bypassed, so this strengthening of export controls might actually affect the industry.\n\n**Risks:** More export controls may lead to China giving tariffs in retaliation- but again, most semis are supply constrained rather than demand constrained so I don't see it as a significant catalyst until more details are released.\n\n**Related Tickers:** [INTC](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=INTC&p=d), [QCOM](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=QCOM&p=d), [ASML](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=ASML&p=d)\n\n**Ticker:** [**BABA**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=BABA&p=d)**,** [**FXI (FTSE China 50 Index)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=FXI&p=d)\n\n**Catalyst:** BABA has introduced its own AI reasoning model within the Qwen framework (like how META has the Llama framework), while we have a surge of all Chinese stock performance following the Chinese government's announcement of liquidity measures.\n\n**Technicals:** It seems as if we've peaked (BABA has gone up close to 50% since the start of this month) for most Chinese stocks in the past few days, I would be interested in being short but I was on vacation this weekend. Interested in shorting BABA specifically if we make another large up move like we did on 2/20.\n\n**Catalyst/Sector Context:** BABA is one of the major competitors that is working on AI models, and is notably using NVDA cards to train its models. \n\n**Risks:** Mainly tariff news and news from other rivals with better models.

    "title": "Nvidia Suppliers Send Mixed Signals for Delays on GB200 Systems \u2013 What It Means for NVDA Stock",
    "selftext": "Recently Analyst Beth Kindig, a bullish analyst, put out an interesting newsletter that was surprisingly bearish on Nvidia due to their supplier commentary. Earnings on Wednesday should be very interesting. Here\u2019s a consolidated copy\n\nSuper Micro Lowers FY25 Revenue Guide, Pushes Back 30% Liquid Cooling Target\n\n\nSuper Micro recently reported preliminary fiscal Q2 results, in which it cut its fiscal 2025 revenue guide while hinting that Blackwell GPUs could take longer to ramp in the first part of the calendar year.\n\nAt Computex in June 2024, CEO Charles Liang stated that he \u201cexpects 15 percent of racks [SMCI] sells this year to use DLC, and 30 percent to employ it [in 2025].\u201d In August 2024,  Liang slightly changed his tune, noting that they now expect \u201c25% to 30% of the new global datacenter deployments to use DLC solutions in the next 12 months.\u201d\n\nI remember this comment well, as it was part of the evidence used to debunk the August rumors considering SMCI had moved up their timeline for DLC delivery (from end of year 2025 to mid-year 2025).\n\nTwo weeks ago in the February 2025 report, this timeline was shifted back with Liang stating that Super Micro now believes that \u201cDLC or overall liquid cooling market share will grow all the way to 30% or even more in the next 12 months\u201d -- it\u2019s not a dramatic shift in tone but rather pushes the 30% target back from mid-year 2025 noted in August, to beyond the original year-end timeline --- to now technically being early 2026.\n\nThe August earnings call also housed one critical piece of information regarding Blackwell and Super Micro\u2019s 2025 revenue. Wells Fargo\u2019s Aaron Rakers questioned management about Blackwell and guidance for December 2024 and onwards. Liang explained that for the December quarter, Blackwell \u201cwill be very small. Engineering sample small volume. So the real volume, I believe, had to be March quarter next year. And that's why we foresee only $26 billion to $30 billion.\u201d\n\nBut now, SMCI implied they are not able to ship Blackwell in the March quarter:\n\nSuper Micro has walked back the revenue guide that hinged on Blackwell\u2019s NVL systems shipping in volume in the March quarter. Management was also quite clear that the new product was facing a delay as they await more GPU supply.\n\nVertiv Signals Softer Q1\n\n\nVertiv is a provider of thermal and power management solutions and is a leader in direct liquid cooling. The company stated they benefited from a \u201cparticularly strong\u201d Q4, with revenue rising nearly 26% YoY as they overdelivered by nearly $200 million as customers wanted products as soon as possible.\n\nVertiv\u2019s strength in Q4 may be tied to key partner Dell, as its AI server backlog in fiscal Q3 (October quarter) rose more than 18% QoQ to $4.5 billion after being flat QoQ in Q2, and its AI pipeline rising more than 50% QoQ. Analysts placed Dell\u2019s AI server pipeline at $16 to $17 billion, up from $11 to $13 billion previously, a rather large jump for one quarter. However, Dell noted that one factor for its softer Q4 and fiscal year guide was the \u201cunpredictability of the AI shipments\u201d as there are \u201csome more timing differences than what we were anticipating when we gave the guide the last quarter.\u201d\n\nFor Q1, Vertiv guided a deceleration to 19% YoY growth, with FY25 revenue growth guided at 16%. Management defended this deceleration into Q1 by saying: \u201cNow of course, Q4 was particularly strong. So we should not look at Q1 as a quarter-to-quarter, really look at the first quarter sales as the acceleration that has taken place. With a 19% organic growth in the first quarter, I feel very, very good about what that tells us about our overall trajectory\u201d and also that it is \u201chigher than what we actually saw in 2024.\u201d\n\nLiquid cooling capacity is not a constraint for Vertiv, as they had said last summer that they were \u201con track to finish in 2024 with a 45x capacity increase compared to baseline at the end of 2023.\u201d\n\nI agree with the analyst sentiment (and weak price action) following the report that the commentary doesn\u2019t check out exactly. management is contradicting itself by guiding for organic growth of 19% at the midpoint for Q1 but 16% growth for the fiscal year (i.e., slower growth later in the year) while stating shipments will increase QoQ.\n\nAdditionally, the QoQ/YoY has to be looked at which is lower than what typical seasonality would account for, as our numbers indicate Vertiv was down (12.1%) due to seasonal sequential growth from Q4-Q1. This year, Vertiv is down (16.9%) from Q4-Q1.\n\nMy conclusion (still to be confirmed) is that Vertiv may see a weak Q2 before there is an acceleration into the back half.\n\n\nNetworking Companies Shift Tone on Timing for GB200s\n\n\nPCIe 6.0 supplier:\n\nPCIe 6.0 is a networking standard expected to initially ship with Nvidia\u2019s Blackwell. A key supplier stated to expect this in the second half of the year, as these products \u201care driving higher dollar content opportunities [...] on a full rack and full accelerator basis and we expect volume deployments to begin in the second half of this year.\u201d\n\nRevealed at GTC in March of 2024, PCIe 6.0 was initially expected to launch with the GB200s. The following quote from this supplier also hints that merchant GPUs (Nvidia) will not be driving H1 \u2013 which would be odd if Blackwell was shipping. \u201cNow, if you look into 2025, we see both contributing growth. The first half of the year will be more predominantly the internal AI accelerator programs. But if you get into the back half of the year, the transition on the merchant GPUs will also be very strong for us. This is where you'll see the custom rack configurations start to deploy and that\u2019s where we see a big dollar increase in our contemporary GPU with [our product] starting to ramp.\u201d\n\nPMIC Suppliers:\n\nPMICs (power management integrated circuits) are a critical part of the picture for Blackwell, given that these components were linked to Blackwell\u2019s rumored power management issues. Major PMIC suppliers were unable to confirm volume shipments in the first quarter in recent earnings calls.\n\nOne PMIC supplier that we covered on our Advanced site on Feb 5th, is stating that \u201cWe know that we're not the only one players going after this, so the share is still to be determined. The final design, everything is still to be finalized as well, too. So we're working closely with the customer. Again, at this point, we can say that we're targeting for a mid-year launch.\u201d\n\nThis company is either discussing Blackwell Ultra with the B300s, or they are implying GB200s are delayed.\n\nThe competing PMIC supplier stated: \u201cJust to add a little bit of color to how we see the year rolling out, we believe that we will be off to a slower start in the first half of the year. But as the year develops, the customer base is expected to broaden as hyperscalers launch their new products. We have multiple product ramps with both existing customers as well as with these new hyperscalers.\u201d\n\nThe takeaway is that neither PMIC supplier can confirm they are shipping in volume in Q1 or Q2, yet meanwhile, both are saying they are still part of the supply chain.\n\nSemtech Suddenly Pulls Guidance on Active Copper Cabling (ACCs)\n\n\nPerhaps the most drastic commentary to come out of the last few weeks was when a key supplier pulled its Q1 guidance intra-quarter.\n\nSemtech filed an 8-K stating that \u201cnet sales from its CopperEdge products used in active copper cables are expected to be lower than the Company\u2019s previously disclosed floor case estimate of $50 million due to rack architecture changes, with no expected ramp-up over the course of fiscal year 2026.\u201d\n\nACC content had been estimated to be substantially higher with 36x2 configurations \u2013 it had been rumored back in October 2024 that Nvidia was halting development of one of the NVL72 configurations, the NVL36x2, which linked two 36 GPU racks together in a side-by-side system. Semtech pulling guidance strengthens this view.\n\nThe shift in architecture to discontinue the 36x2 configuration was said to possibly \u201cdisrupt the supply chain for assembly and cooling solutions,\u201d by removing dual-rack configurations and focusing solely on single-rack NVL72 and NVL36 configurations. DLC suppliers have been pushing back Blackwell\u2019s ramp later in the year, suggesting that the market may have faced some impacts from this rumored design change late last year.\n\nWhile shifting architectures is not a big deal in the medium-term (as stated above, NVL72 single rack configurations are expected to see a higher mix); it\u2019s the suddenness that Semtech pulled it\u2019s guidance that is cause for concern as the company had reaffirmed its optimistic revenue floor guidance  based on two factors \u2013 the timing of Blackwell\u2019s launch and changes in rack design. This suggests both factors may be in play, as a late-stage design change was expected to have downstream impacts on timing for DLC ramping.\n\nConclusion:\nGiven market jitters around DeepSeek, which turned out to be a non-issue, something more material related to the GB200s, such as growth slowing below expectations at the start of the new fiscal year, could send the stock below $100 -- which we would see as a buying opportunity.\n\nThere is a scenario where Nvidia\u2019s stock marches higher \u2013 perhaps based on the remaining strength from Hopper and the B200s, B200 HGX systems and B200As packaged with CoWoS-S and having a lower thermal design power (TDP). Or perhaps the string of suppliers discussed here are simply stating the GB200s are not ramping in volume in Q1 but will in Q2.",

    "selftext": "This is a daily watchlist for short-term trading: I might trade all/none of the stocks listed, and even stocks not listed!\n\nI am targeting potentially good candidates for short-term trading; I have no opinion on them as investments.\n\nThe potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting, everything else is secondary.\n\nMost interesting news today is the hope that the meeting between Russian/US officials may end the three-year war in Ukraine, in addition to release of the Grok-3 model from xAI (Elon Musk's AI startup.)\n\nNews: [Musk S Xai Debuts Grok 3 Ai Bot Touting Benchmark Superiority](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-18/musk-s-xai-debuts-grok-3-ai-bot-touting-benchmark-superiority)\n\n**Ticker:** [**NVDA (NVIDIA)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&p=d)/[**SMH**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SMH&p=d)/every semis and AI facing stock\n\n**Catalyst:** Elon Musk's AI startup, xAI, has unveiled its latest model, Grok-3, claiming it surpasses competitors like GPT-4o, Google Gemini, DeepSeek V3, and Claude.\n\nThese assertions have not been independently verified by the open sourcen community but it wouldn't be surprising if it could surpass 4o (the model is close to a year old now)\n\n**Technicals:** No real level I've been watching in NVDA, SMH, already positioned long. Note that xAI uses NVDA GPU's specifically in their super computer.\n\n**Catalyst/Sector Context:** We've seen a very strong recovery since the Deepseek fears caused a selloff. Personally I don't think xAI will cause the same effect that Deepseek did, but I think that the semis are a winner of this again.\n\n**Risks:** Unverified performance claims may lead to skepticism among investors and potential customers, impacting adoption rates and market trust. XAI has a \u201cColossus supercomputer,\u201d for training AI, which it said last year was utilizing a cluster of 100,000 advanced Nvidia GPUs for AI training.\n\nToday, the company revealed that it doubled the size of its GPU cluster for the training of Grok 3.\n\n**Related Tickers:** ARM, AMD, INTC\n\n**Offhand Comments:** May see reversal of news if performance doesn't match claims.\n\n**Ticker:** [**HEES (Herc Holdings Inc.)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=HEES&p=d)\n\n**Catalyst:** HEES has confirmed a $105 per share acquisition offer from Herc Rentals, surpassing the previous $92 per share bid from United Rentals.\n\n**Technicals:** Watching $100 level. They've accepted the bid so we might see trading closer to that bid price in the near future.\n\n**Catalyst/Sector Context:** Equipment rental industry is witnessing consolidation due to decelerating growth since 2023 (other than that nothing explosive)\n\n**Risks:** The bidding war may escalate acquisition costs, potentially leading to overvaluation and financial strain for the acquiring company.\n\n**Related Tickers:** URI, HRI\n\n**Ticker:** [**NKE (Nike Inc)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NKE&p=d)\n\n**Catalyst:** Nike has announced a new brand collaboration with SKIMS, launching a line called NikeSKIMS.\n\n**Technicals:** Watching $75 level.\n\n**Catalyst/Sector Context:** SKIMS is pretty popular- mainly does underwear/loungewear/shapewear but this might be more focused on athleisure. This could potentially make a difference in NKE sales- SKIMS also collaborated with The North Face in the past, so worth keeping track of this for future catalysts in case they work with other brands.\n\n**Related Tickers:** LULU, UAA\n\n**Tickers:** [**LMT (Lockheed Martin )**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=LMT&p=d)**/**[**GD (General Dynamics )**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=GD&p=d)**/**[**RTX (Raytheon)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=RTN&p=d)\n\n**Catalyst:** Unconfirmed reports suggest that President Trump plans to demand $500 billion from Ukraine and seek U.S. control over the country's mineral resources.\n\nThese claims have not been reported by major U.S. news outlets but have appeared in international media (from India, Canada, UK)\n\n**Technicals:** This catalyst has been \"semi-leaked\" for the past week but not \"fully confirmed\", but we would likely see a selloff in defense stocks if true.\n\n**Catalyst/Sector Context:** These companies would go to the downside from an end to the Ukraine war, and spike if talks aren't successful.\n\n**Risks:** Pretty much a \"wait for the news announcement\" kind of trade, pretty straightforward.\n\n**Related Tickers:** BA, NOC, HAL\n\n**Ticker:** [**BIDU (Baidu)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=BIDU&p=d)\n\n**Catalyst:** BIDU earnings with an EPS of \u00a519.18 vs \u00a514.13. Revenue of \u00a534.1 billion vs \u00a533.4 billion.\n\nThe company noted a 178% quarter-over-quarter increase in external API calls for its ERNIE AI bot and expects its AI investments to deliver more significant results in 2025.\n\nAdditionally, Apollo Go has commenced 100% fully driverless operations across China since February.\n\n  \n**Catalyst/Sector Context:** The technology sector is rapidly advancing in AI and autonomous driving technologies. Something interesting over the weekend was Xi meeting with private sector business leaders, signaling that China would be more friendly to business leaders (like Jack Ma)  \n  \n**Risks:** It's China.  \n  \n**Related Tickers:** BABA, JD",

Intangible factors like these are part of why I believe companies like Tesla trade at such higher multiples than companies like Google and Microsoft, where people like Elon can divert investors' attention away from fundamentals to distant visions of multi-industry dominance. \nThat being said, I've compiled a few stocks that along with fundamentals have leadership that I believe can buoy future growth, such as OKLO, HIMS, and NVDA. Do you guys have any more suggestions prioritizing this factor?\n\nEdit: Preferably that you have seen less discussion around",

Elliott is believed to push the company to spin off or sell midstream opportunities.\n\n**Technicals:** We made a 6% move (just like when Elliott took a stake in BP), we may see another leg of movement during the day.\n\n**Risks:** Spinning off a segment reduces income diversification (at the possible benefit of having a higher valuation multiple), more of a long-term investment risk than a short term one. In the short-term, expect a ton of marginal headlines that will move the stock up/down 1% depending on how they want to make changes.\n\n**Related Tickers:** BP, XOM, CVX, MPC\n\n**Ticker:** [**LSCC (Lattice Semiconductor)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=LSCC&p=d)\n\n**Catalyst:** LSCC reported EPS of $0.15 vs. $0.19 expected. Revenue of $117.4 million vs. $117 million expected. Provided strong indication of improving customer consumption and stronger future demand.\n\n**Technicals:** Watching $65 level to the upside. Overall not interested in shorting this if I had to take a position.\n\n**Catalyst/Sector Context:** The semiconductor industry is signaling increased demand and increased spending across all companies, which is bullish obviously. Despite slightly missing EPS they signaled a good enough outlook that the stock reacted positively to Earnings. LSCC makes low power FPGAs.\n\n**Related Tickers:** NVDA, AMD, INTC, TXN\n\n**Ticker:** [**ASTS (AST SpaceMobile)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=ASTS&p=d)\n\n**Catalyst:** Following TMUS's announcement of compatibility with Starlink Beta, ASTS (a close competitor) experienced an 18% increase, with potential for further movement (both upside/downside) today, particularly around the $30 level.\n\n**Technicals:** I'm leaning more towards pullback today, watching $30 level.\n\n**Catalyst/Sector Context:** The satellite communications industry is rapidly evolving, with major players forming partnerships to expand global connectivity. Starlink is the biggest company out there, but ASTS moves whenever adoption news comes out, like it did previously with Verizon.\n\n**Risks:** Competition from entities like Starlink may pressure ASTS's market share and profitability in the future, especially when SpaceX is expected to IPO (eventually). Remember that ASTS has 5 satellites and is working on \\~19 more.\n\n**Offhand Comments:** The market's reaction underscores the \"adoption trade\", kind of like how all the weed stocks moved with each other.\n\n**Ticker:** [**PLTR (Palantir Technologies)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=PLTR&p=d)\n\n**Catalyst:** Nothing significant today, but we saw a huge spike up to $117.75 yesterday, likely from comments made during the Paris AI summit. Currently short.\n\n**Technicals:** Interested in $115 level as an add, on the short side. Watching $120 as the level to cover on.\n\n**Catalyst/Sector Context:** PLTR has made the mother of all moves recently, gaining 50% in the past 2 weeks. Most of that was from earnings,\n\n**Risks:** For a trade, I'm capping my risk at $120- everyone and their mother knows that PLTR is overvalued and run on hype at this point, and a move up to $100 from earnings might be tolerable but adding an extra 15% on top of that is irrational (in my opinion). Obviously there's significant retail interest in this stock, so will have to be agile and cognizant of what they're thinking as stock moves around.\n\n**Related Tickers:** All AI related companies.\n\n**EARNINGS: SMCI, UPST, DASH, LYFT**",

Announces that profit could fall by $2B or more due to tariffs and lower EV demand.\n\n**Technicals:** Pretty much broke the $10 level it's been trading around since August, watching to see if it'll sell off more by the open. Highly/infinitely liquid.\n\n**Catalyst/Sector Context:** The entire automotive industry is challenged by tariffs. F guided lower for 2025.\n\n**Risks:** Obviously these are one of the bigger movers from Mexico tariffs (most cars are assembled in Mexico then shipped to the US).\n\n**Related Tickers:** GM, TSLA, STLA.\n\n**Offhand Comments:** Ford's outlook reflects the broader industry's apprehension about geopolitical factors affecting operations and profitability.

Buoyed by Deepseek ban news, most likely as well.\n\n**Technicals:** Was down roughly 8% after earnings, but seems to be somewhat recovering after Deepseek news.\n\n**Catalyst/Sector Context:** Semiconductor sector is experiencing heightened demand, especially after PLTR's comments that the AI train will never stop. We're seeing growth in data center applications, the main driver of semis purchases.\n\n**Risks:** Despite strong performance, Arm's lowered full-year revenue forecast has led to a 6% drop in its shares.\n\n**Related Tickers:** NVDA, AMD, INTC.\n\n**Ticker:** [**RBLX (Roblox Corporation)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=RBLX&p=d)\n\n**Catalyst:** Roblox Corporation reported earnings with an EPS of -$0.33 vs. -$0.46 expected.

Seems to be a massive overreaction selloff (but has recovered somewhat).\n\n**Risks:** IIRC Roblox isn't profitable yet- they're focusing on growth/revenue over profits, but most of their costs are outside their control (platform fees like the Apple store, developers, infrastructure for trust/safety for minors).\n\n**Related Tickers:** EA, TTWO.\n\n**Ticker:** [**NVDA (NVIDIA Corporation)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&p=d)\n\n**Catalyst:** DeepSeek, a Chinese AI start-up, has temporarily suspended its API service top-ups due to server resource constraints. Additionally, U.S. lawmakers plan to introduce a bill to ban DeepSeek's chatbot application from government-owned devices over data security concerns.\n\n**Catalyst/Sector Context:** The AI industry is under increased scrutiny regarding data security and geopolitical tensions but that's grown more laissez-faire under Trump. DeepSeek's service suspension and potential U.S. government ban helps American chip makers and NVDA especially, due to their continued dominance.\n\n**Risks:** Deepseek getting banned will likely lead to greater reliance on American AI chatbots, spurring growth in American semis manufacturers.\n\n**Related Tickers:** AMD, INTC, QCOM.\n\n**Offhand Comments:** (I am currently long).\n\n**Ticker:** [**SWKS (Skyworks Solutions)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SWKS&p=d)\n\n**Catalyst:** EPS of $1.60 vs. $1.57 expected.

If we get closer I'm interested in some small bounce depending on volume/size of the move.\n\n**Catalyst/Sector Context:** SWKS supplies some of the chips for Apple's iPhone, and their iPhone sales haven't done too well recently- thus this has a knock-on effect by affecting SWKS's sales.\n\n**Risks:** SWKS projected a revenue decline for the mobile segment and issued a lower profit forecast. They stated they anticipated a \"mid-to-high teens decline in mobile.\"\n\n**Offhand Comments: A lot of the firms that manufacture parts for the iPhone are linked in performance, especially if the iPhone is the main source of their sales- would be interesting to formulate some trading ideas from that.**\n\n**Related Tickers:** QCOM, AVGO, TXN.\n\n**Earnings today:** [**AMZN**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AMZN&p=d).",

    "title": "Thinking about NVDA beyond 2025 Hyperscaler CapEx Growth",
    "selftext": "With 3/4 hyperscalers reporting earnings already, the reaction to Nvidia has been positive, but stock still trades less than before DeepSeek. I believe the sentiment is that while 2025 will be great, Nvidia is nearing the \"end of great times\" and moving to a \"just good times\".\n\n**Here's my take at a breakdown. I am not an expert, but have read a lot of positive and negative takes, I'm starting this thread to start a discussion not to pump the stock. Please don't comment \"Nvidia diamond hands durr\".**\u00a0I didn't use AI to write this sadly.\n\nI can't link out to some of the resources, but tried to describe them for easy search and find.\n\n**TLDR:**\u00a0Meeting 2025 revenue projections isn't at excessive risk based on CapEx raises so far. It's likely that production capacity may really be the limiting reagent for 2025 revenues not demand. Market is forward looking and there is uncertainity on 2026+ revenues (DeepSeek is one of them) - markets don't like that. However, uncertainity is an opportunity if Nvidia can deliver again - remember stocks climb a wall of worry.\n\n**Disclosure:**\u00a0Own a lot of NVDA. But have covered calls on them, so not a blindfold risktaker.\n\n**Personal take:**\u00a0NVDA is attractive at these levels, but I'd be cautious holding my entire position after the summer 2025 earnings calls from the hyperscalers, because if there's any indication there is a 2026 CapEx slowdown, stock could fall a lot. I can't predict the future, so diversification is important even if you like the stock.\n\nHowever, continued chip innovation that maintains a competitive advantage that leads to higher end customer ROIs compared to other chip alternatives would help. Also, release of one tangible AI product would change the sentiment and game here (e.g. Robotaxis, enterprise solutions used common place for F500 companies, etc). Many are already underway - my company is releasing Gemini for all employees - this goes beyond software engineers. I think diversification across the industry (AVGO, TSM, power producers) could be valuable as time progresses as the AI use case boom happens.\n\n\\-----------------------------------------\n\n**(1) Meeting 2025 Revenue projections isn't at excessive risk based on CapEx raises so far**\n\nBased on\u00a0[stockanalysis](https://stockanalysis.com/stocks/nvda/forecast/)\u00a0consensus 2024 to 2025 revenue growth is estimated to be 52%.\n\n1. MSFT: 55.7B in 2024 to 80B in 2025\n2. Google: 52.5B in 2024 to 75B in 2025\n3. Meta: 39B in 2024 to 60B - 60B in 2025\n\nBased on the numbers written above, the anticipated growth from hyperscaler capex spend is 46% (if we assume concentration of NVDA chip spend as percent of capex steady). Hyperscalers are estimated to be about 50% of Nvidia revenue. To reach the 52% target that means from the remainder of the revenue book, Nvidia needs 58% spend increase.\n\nThis doesn't seem unreasonable.\u00a0**Potential**\u00a0investments through StarGate (Oracle), OpenAI's increasingly independent spending funded by Softbank, and sovereign AI investments are a tailwind to that figure. However, sustained export controls (e.g. Biden's global export framework) and increased crackdowns are headwinds.\n\n**(2) It's likely that production capacity may really be the limiting reagent for 2025 revenues not demand**\n\nBased on multiple\u00a0[sources](https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/nvidias-blackwell-gpus-are-sold-out-for-the-next-12-months-chipmaker-to-gain-market-share-in-2025?utm_source=chatgpt.com), seems like Blackweel is sold out for the next 12 months anyways. So 2025 revenues may be a matter of strong production. Moreover, from the commentary that google had on their earnings call - seems like cloud growth is supply constrained by infrastructure rather than demand constrained. I believe for 2025 at least customers will buy as many NVIDIA chips as they can and its production that determines valuation.\n\nSince the market is forward looking, 2025 revenue misses won't be as crucial as addressing the question of when is the demand going to slow down and the AI semiconductor sales from NVDA slowdown?\n\n**(3) Market is forward looking and there is uncertainity on 2026+ revenues (DeepSeek is one of them)..markets don't like that**\n\nNo matter how you slice it, DeepSeek has provided true software driven advances that more efficiently use Nvidia GPUs and non-NVDA GPUs on the training and particularly inference level. You can look at the cost per inference token for DeepSeek vs. OpenAI. It has raised questions on the sustainability on needing cutting edge chips at high margins in the long run. Risks below.\n\n* **Do closed loop models even have a moat over open source?**: Can closed-loop/proprietary LLMs develop models that demand a strong ROI justifying investment in more chips to\u00a0**train**\u00a0better models that\u00a0**end users are willing to pay for**? Currently Sam Altman & Dario (Antropic) think compute is the way to go. However, at some point they could discover more compute for training =/= better or more efficient models.\n* **Training:**\u00a0Efficiencies in hardware utilization may reduce Nvidia's moat in interconnectivity and lead to better training advances, which could reduce margins if other chips are \"somewhat as good\" eventually given demand equalizes to supply.\u00a0See point # 1 in this excellent recap here  (available by searching DeepSeek and the ramification on the AI industry: winners and losers? by Rihard Jarc)\n* **More use cases in a post training world could mean more inference on custom chips & competitor products:**\u00a0It is widely believed that Nvidia is more of an undisputed leader in training performance vs. inference. If open source models become good enough and training investments do not result in monetizable ROI, Nvidia's margins likely fall as custom chips and other semiconductor players provide good solutions.\u00a0[Jevon's Paradox (more use cases and usage)](https://www.npr.org/sections/planet-money/2025/02/04/g-s1-46018/ai-deepseek-economics-jevons-paradox)\u00a0is very likely here, but volume would have to increase signficantly to offset margin decreases - a risk that the market doesn't like.\n* **CUDA alternatives leads to market share loses?:**\u00a0CUDA is widely known to be the best option \"coding\" platform to get GPUs to do what you want right now.\u00a0[However, there are other applications coming out that allow fungible usage of other chips.\u00a0](https://www.theregister.com/2024/12/17/nvidia_cuda_moat/#:~:text=If%20you're%20doing%20low,AMD%20hardware%20%E2%80%93%20and%20vice%20versa)This reduces the need to use Nvidia chips and pay such high margins. There's drawbacks to not using CUDA that I'll highlight in section 4.\n\nSidenote - there is an\u00a0honest and excellent podcast on DeepSeek implications to Nvidia from Bankless w/ Jeffrey Emmanuel (whose blogpost got a lot of investors interested in DeepSeek impact over 2 weekends ago). Please listen.\n\n**(4) However, uncertainity is an opportunity if Nvidia can deliver again - remember stocks climb a wall of worry.**\n\n* **Early innings of the AI story:**\u00a0Models are going to get more complex not stagnate. This requires more training compute as we try to reach AGI level models. On the inference front, as more use cases explode, there will be more general chip demand. We haven't even seen full released use cases in robotics, autonomous transit, healthcare AI, etc.\n* **CUDA is the lowest latency**\u00a0and provides best performance as of now. There might be a technical limit to how well alternatives perform.\n* **Cost of being last**\u00a0in AI is too great for hyperscalers\n* **Continued innovation leadership:**\u00a0Nvidia has expedited it's semiconductor cycle from 2 years to 1 year. Rubin (next gen AI chips) are already being worked on. Semiconductors are known to be cylical, but this may dull any trough cycle.\n* **Increased soverign AI investments**\u00a0(StarGate, Middle east, etc.)\n* **Ridiculous cash flow with minimal R&D**\u00a0as % of revenue means that Nvidia can invest in strategic ventures, emerging tech, and adjacent spaces to diversify revenue streams. Not sure this is proven out in the financials yet, but could in the future.\n* **Hopefully - reduced interest rates boosts stock valuations**.\n\nI've included a screenshot of interviews by Rihard Jarc with a former AMD employee on CUDA and training needs going forward after DeepSeek.",

Cited FAR more spending in CapEx and a miss in cloud revenue (which signals that other competitors have taken their market share)\n\n**Catalyst/Sector Context:** Market had a pretty negative reaction to the news that they'd be investing far more in capex and missed on cloud revenue (was roughly $9B vs $12B expected).\n\n**Risks:** Elevated capital spending may pressure Alphabet's margins if the capex spending doesn't result in increased revenue, especially amidst increasing competition in the AI and cloud markets. I don't really see the China investigation to affect their stock price much, Google Search and Youtube are blocked in China and I doubt that China is going to let Waymo operate in their cities rather than creating their own solution.\n\n**Related Tickers:** MSFT, META, MAG7\n\n**Ticker:** [**UPS (United Parcel Service)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=UPS&p=d)**,** [**FDX (FedEx Corporation)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=FDX&p=d)**,** [**PDD (Pinduoduo Inc.)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=PDD&p=d)\n\n**Catalyst:** The U.S. Postal Service has suspended accepting parcels from China and Hong Kong following new tariffs imposed by Trump, affecting logistics companies like UPS and FedEx.\n\n**Technicals:** I'm mainly interested in PDD because they own Temu, which focuses on shipping small/low-cost goods to the US and using the loophole for very low shipping costs.\n\n**Catalyst/Sector Context:** The recent suspension by USPS may lead to increased demand for private carriers like UPS and FedEx to handle parcels from China. There are a number of Chinese companies that focus on shipping low cost goods (like PDD).\n\n**Risks:** Heightened tariffs and trade barriers could disrupt supply chains, increase costs, and lead to potential overreliance on private carriers, which may face capacity constraints and regulatory scrutiny.\n\n**Related Tickers:** XPO\n\n**Ticker:** [**UBER (Uber Technologies)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=UBER&p=d)\n\n**Catalyst:** Uber reported fourth-quarter 2024 earnings with an EPS of $3.21 vs. $0.48 expected. Revenue of $12B vs. $11.8B expected. Cited that they plan to do buybacks of their own stock.\n\n**Technicals:** Watching $60 level, no bias.\n\n**Catalyst/Sector Context:** Despite Uber's strong quarterly performance, they cited a potential $1 billion impact from a strong U.S. dollar on future bookings which results in worse earnings overseas.\n\n**Risks:** Outside of self-driving cars (Uber partnered with Waymo to operate in Austin), currency fluctuations and international markets affect companies you wouldn't normally expect. This may move in future from tariff news.\n\n**Related Tickers:** LYFT\n\n**Ticker:** [**USO (United States Oil Fund)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=USO&p=d)**,** [**BP (BP)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=BP&p=d)**,** [**CVX (Chevron )**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=CX&p=d)**,** **Other Oil Stocks**\n\n**Catalyst:** Trump announced that the United States plans to take over the Gaza Strip, relocate its residents to neighboring countries, and redevelop the area.\n\n**Technicals:** USO didn't move much on this piece of news, but if Trump actually makes this a policy then we might see a LOT more volatility in the future depending on how serious we get and if we get involved again.\n\n**Catalyst/Sector Context:** The oil sector is sensitive to geopolitical developments in the Middle East, a region critical to global oil supply. Initial market reactions to Trump's Gaza proposal didn't impact oil prices. Not really a catalyst TODAY but worth thinking about in the future.\n\n**Risks:** Potential escalation of regional tensions could disrupt oil production or transportation, leading to supply constraints and increased volatility in oil prices.\n\n**Related Tickers:** XOM",

Tariffs on Mexico/Canada are delayed, but we still have tariffs on China, and tariffs have been promised by Trump on the EU.\n\nNews: [As Trump Tariffs Take Effect, China Retaliates With Trade Measures Against U.S.](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/02/04/us/trump-tariffs-news?unlocked_article_code=1.uU4.ps2-.DRzgfM1GnN9i)\n\n**Ticker:** [**PLTR (Palantir Technologies Inc)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=PLTR&p=d)\n\n**Catalyst:** Reported earnings of $0.14 vs. $0.11 expected. Revenue of $828 million vs. $777 million expected. Management highlighted the power of AI and their sizable contracts, citing the nature of the AI war being winner-take-all.\n\n**Technicals:** PLTR absolutely exploded and hit $102 premarket, currently watching $100 level to see if we continue the move. Other than that unlikely to be trading this unless we have massive volume come in.\n\n**Catalyst/Sector Context:** The PLTR ER highlighted the growing demand for AI-driven solutions across government/commercial sectors. Company emphasized securing substantial contracts in the competitive AI landscape, important because they are more closely aligned with the current government.\n\n**Risks:** Obviously being more closely tied to the government means that it has more leeway to be more monopolistic/aggresive in their actions, Alex Karp and Peter Thiel are closely aligned with current government leaders.\n\n**Related Tickers:** MSFT, GOOGL, IBM, AMZN\n\n**Ticker:** [**NVDA (NVIDIA Corporation)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&p=d)\n\n**Catalyst:** Chinese AI company DeepSeek is reportedly preparing to switch to domestic GPUs to circumvent NVDA chip restrictions. DeepSeek has bypassed NVDA CUDA for certain operations, utilizing the PTX (Parallel Thread Execution) language instead. Additionally, on February 2nd, DeepSeek, in collaboration with SiliconFlow and Huawei Cloud, launched DeepSeek-R1/V3 inference services on Huawei's Ascend AI chips. Huawei is also promoting its new Ascend AI processors to Chinese groups considering \"inference\" as an option.\n\n**Technicals:** After the insane move we've seen from $150 to $118, I actually don't consider this to be earth shattering news- China has always been trying to develop their own semis and not using NVDA for training is what they were \"supposed\" to be doing due to the trade restrictions. I'm still long but selling calls against my position, recovery might be slow for NVDA. It's interesting that they are attempting to bypass CUDA, which is essentially the \"standard\" for ML/AI training nowadays on NVDA chips and developing their own.\n\n**Catalyst/Sector Context:** DeepSeek's move to adopt domestic GPUs and bypass CUDA indicates they're aiming for technological self-reliance amidst U.S. export restrictions, rather than trying to adopt more NVDA chips (which presumably isn't a viable long term strategy).\n\n**Risks:** Nvidia faces potential revenue loss if Chinese companies increasingly adopt domestic GPUs and alternative programming frameworks. The effectiveness of U.S. export controls may be undermined as Chinese firms develop workarounds.\n\n**Related Tickers:** AMD, INTC, QCOM, TSM\n\n**Ticker:** [**BABA**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=BABA&p=d)**/(oil stocks, car stocks, etc).**\n\n**Catalyst:** U.S. implemented a 10% tariff on all Chinese imports, aiming to address issues related to drug trafficking, particularly fentanyl. In response, China announced retaliatory tariffs effective February 10, including a 15% tariff on U.S. coal and liquefied natural gas, and a 10% tariff on crude oil, agricultural machinery, and large-engine vehicles.\n\n**Catalyst/Sector Context:** The imposition of these tariffs marks a significant escalation in U.S.-China trade tension and more volatility to come through Trump tweets- we might see a trade war again (sigh) like we did in 2019. Not 100% sure if agricultural machinery will affect stocks like DE but will look into it.\n\n**Related Tickers:** JD, BIDU, TCEHY, PDD\n\n**Offhand Comments:** There are going to be retaliation investigations against companies operating in America, INTC and GOOG have recently been announced as under investigation by China. But it's very important to remember which companies have a presence in China and which don't- for example, GOOG search hasn't worked in China since 2010 lol.\n\n**Ticker:** [**GRAB (Grab Holdings Limited)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=GRAB&p=d)\n\n**Catalyst:** Grab Holdings Ltd. is considering a takeover of its Indonesian rival, GoTo Group, at a valuation of approximately $7 billion.\n\n**Technicals:** Watching $5 level, no bias. I'm not 100% sure if there's an actual \"acquisition\" share price for GoTo but will keep eyes peeled for that acquisition premium.\n\n**Catalyst/Sector Context:** The potential merger represents a significant consolidation in SEA's ride-hailing and food delivery sectors. Mergers typically streamline operations and reduce competition, leading to improved profitability for the combined entity.\n\n**Risks:** The proposed merger may face regulatory hurdles, including antitrust concerns, which could delay or derail the deal.

    "selftext": "The introduction of Deepseek probably doesn't warrant the sharp stock decline value of NVDA, that is understandable. But so is their stock value rise for the past 2 years. To put it in other words, yes the decline was a result of a hype, but so was the rise. Something that didn't make much sense got replaced by another thing that doesn't make much sense. At the end of the day, Nvidia is a great company that sells the best computer chips and GPU's, but that's all there is to it. I just don't see how they can rise again for the foreseeable future. They've hit a peak point in my opinion. And while Deepseek's introduction shouldn't have been the reason for their stock decline vlue, it was just a trigger for something that was in my opinion inevitable. \n\nI was pressured by family members into buying NVDA, and now the total loss is about 13.5% of its original price. I feel like I should just close the position as I just don't see how it can rise again for me to recoup the losses, but I also don't want to do something based on feelings. I hope someone in this subreddit can help. I try to do some due diligence and understand metrics, but I'm no expert and I'm finding it difficult to put the time into learning these things with my very demanding fulltime job, which is why I usually stick with  low risky ETF's, except for Nvidia which I was kinda pressured into buying, and I was worried that it might become even more profitable and then hearing \"I told you so!\".",

    "title": "AAPL - 26,527.62% return over 25 years",
    "selftext": "Today to the day is the anniversary of twenty five years of my first purchase of AAPL shares.  I bought 1200 dollars worth.\n\nIn early 2000, I had just graduated college.  I had a few thousand given to me as an inheritance that was being managed by a broker.\n\n I asked the broker about purchasing some Apple shares, and he was unimpressed, and unmoved. I was annoyed at him. Apple was the one I had the strongest impulse to purchase.\n\n Why apple? I had gone from being skeptical of Apple. My  college was very heavily Mac, but I had PCs.  I was unimpressed at the OS, but I was struck by people\u2019s reactions to Jobs.  He was enthusiastic, and I liked the cut of the jib who liked the cut of his jib. I was drawn to the elitism of the people to the brand, and felt it could bounce back. This was even before iPods, mind you, before OS X.  \n\nThese were the days of the dotcom boom. This broker was taking like 500 bucks for every trade. This felt unfair, in light of the great digital democratization that was in progress, I wanted the power.  And E*trade was relatively new and it seemed legit.  I hadn\u2019t done anything like this before, I was just a kid, really, but I decided to just go for it. \n\nI sold most of the shares I inherited, and threw 1200 bucks into Apple.  `(also a few other, less impressive stocks)' I did marvelously the first few months as the market soared, as did most people. \n\nAnd\u2026. it  came tumbling down in April 2000.  Disillusioned, I decided not to try to reposition my shares, and I just let things ride for a few months.  When I rebalanced by portfolio, I kept my apple shares, which had split, despite the pull-back.\n\nEvery year, I would consider would I buy more apple now?  And it didn't occurr me to sell. Apple often seemed almost comically undervalued, and I held on or increased my investment in it.\n\nEvery time apple goes up 1 point, I get more than my initial investment back. Why? Splits.\n\n\u2022\t2-for-1 split in 2000  \n\u2022\t2-for-1 split in 2005  \n\u2022\t7-for-1 split in 2014  \n\u2022\t4-for-1 split in 2020\n\nNowadays cost basis: .88 cents.     As of today that investment has grown 26,527.62%. I added more and more apple across the years, and had some other lucky calls (my second largest holding is NVDA) but no move matches that whimsical lucky move of 25 years ago today.\n\nThe security that owning these securities has offered me is significant.  It has let me have a job that isn\u2019t that well-payed and support my family with emergencies being take of by extra funds. We own a lot of apple products, because with the dividends, it sort of just pays for them.\n\nI do think it\u2019s good to give early adults access to a few thousand dollars to play the market and plan to do that with my own children.  Although I didn\u2019t sell my shares, what I did do is convert a bunch of them to a donor advised fund (avoiding taxes, whee), and I give to charity from that for annual giving, and that feels like a win win win proposition.  \n\nI do feel overexposed in AAPL and NVDA, but due to still hopefully having another at least 25 years to go in my life is that pullbacks eventually come back up. The biggest principle that has guided my investing is \u201cDon\u2019t buy crap if you can help it\u201d, and that's my advice to new investors.",

Deepseek capabilities are expected to be copied by US firms.\n\nNews: [Fed's Favored Inflation Gauge Posted Muted Advance In December](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-31/fed-s-favored-inflation-gauge-posted-muted-advance-in-december)\n\nTicker: [AAPL (Apple Inc.)](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AAPL&p=d)\n\nCatalyst: Apple reported EPS of $2.40 vs. $2.35, and revenue of $124.3B vs 124B.\n\nDespite these positive results, the company provided cautious guidance for the upcoming quarter, citing uncertainties related to the impact of new AI features on sales. Tim Cook mentioned that Apple Intelligence DID lead to stronger sales/growth in areas where it was rolled out (it has limited rollout right now).\n\nVolume/Market Cap/Technicals: Watching $250 level, no strong bias. We've seen AAPL swing close to 20% this month, (on report of sales weakness in China) but doubt this will continue.\n\nContext: Most immediate news that comes to mind was the weakness of sales in China for the iPhone, causing the move this month.\n\nRisks: Don't really see immediate risks beyond the trade war, in 2019/2020 this resulted in AAPL moving manufacturing/production to other countries in South East Asia- slowing growth in China has been pretty consistent, however.\n\nRelated Tickers: rest of FAANG, Samsung if you can trade overseas stocks, the various phone component manufacturers that trade with AAPL\n\nOffhand: Apple is investing in its own high-speed network infrastructure to enhance content delivery, (just like META's undersea pipeline)\n\nTicker: [ACMR (ACM Research, Inc.)](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=ACMR&p=d)\n\nCatalyst: Kerrisdale Capital released a bullish report on ACM Research (ACMR), a semiconductor wafer fabrication equipment (WFE) company positioned in China but headquartered in America.\n\nIt leads China as a leading supplier of wafer cleaning tools and beneficiary of China's push toward semiconductor self-sufficiency.\n\nKerrisdale predicts the company to eventually compete globally and cites it as a potential 10x return. Trades at 1x 2025E revenue (likely due to China fears).\n\nVolume/Market Cap/Technicals: This is the interesting part- ACMR holds a $1.2B mkt cap but trades at a massive discount compared to its Chinese subsidiary (ACMS), which has a $5.9 billion market cap and trades at 6x 2025E revenue.\n\nThe report suggests that ACMR\u2019s NASDAQ valuation is severely mispriced and could re-rate significantly as investors recognize the valuation gap.\n\nContext: China/US chip war, you guys know what this is.\n\nSector Context: The global semiconductor industry is shifting, with China attempting to localize chip production.\n\nKerrisdale argues that restrictions on U.S. and Japanese WFE exports to China will only fuel ACMR\u2019s growth as Chinese fabs increasingly turn to domestic suppliers.\n\nChina's WFE self-sufficiency has grown from 4% in 2019 to 17% in 2024 and is expected to reach 36% by 2026.\n\nRisks: Geopolitical factors, including further U.S. export restrictions, could impact ACMR\u2019s operations. Similar to how we have the NVDA trade restriction going on right now. However, Kerrisdale sees these restrictions as a net positive due to ACMR having less competition in China as a result. There are other players in the WFE space in China, but ACMR has a technological moat.\n\nRelated Tickers: LRCX, AMAT, KLAC\n\nTicker: [INTC](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=INTC&p=d)\n\nCatalyst: Intel reported revenue of $14.26B vs exp of $13.81B. Most important, the company anticipated breakeven EPS next quarter.\n\nVolume/Market Cap/Technicals: Somewhat rangebound for the past 3 months. Watching $20 but nothing interesting I'm watching beyond that.\n\nContext: This earnings report is Intel's first since the departure of CEO Pat Gelsinger. Right now INTC is being led by two interim co-CEOs, and another price catalyst that could potentially happen is someone competent being picked lol. Also worth thinking of the NVDA/Deepseek/semiconductor news when reading through these catalysts.\n\nIntel has also announced a delay in its Falcon Shores GPU and only using it internally within the company.\n\nRisks: Intel faces significant competition from companies such as NVIDIA and AMD, the delay of their chip is pretty bad news.\n\nRelated Tickers: AMD/NVDA/TSM\n\nTicker: [ASTS](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=ASTS&p=d)\n\nCatalyst: ASTS has received special temporary authority from the FCC to test its space-based cellular broadband network in the United States. Allows for collaboration efforts with VZ/T.\n\nVolume/Market Cap/Technicals: Slight rise, but will watch this at open to see if volume comes in.\n\nContext: The FCC's authorization allows ASTS to provide cell/satellite comms, allowing for greater coverage and signals that more use of ASTS satellites. I remember that the company was essentially valued based on each satellite they launched successfully in 2024, whether that hype returns remains to be seen but overall not interested in trading this unless we have retail interest again.\n\nSector Context: SpaceX's Starlink is also entering the direct-to-cell market, as I noted a few days ago- most of the investment that can be done in these type of cell/sat comms in public markets can really only be done in ASTS.\n\nRisks: If SpaceX IPOs we might see a selloff in this stock simply because SpaceX is far larger/established and Elon Musk has closer ties to the government.\n\nRelated Tickers: T/VZ/RKLB",

Trying out longer form, more detailed catalyst examinations over the short-form with more tickers.**\n\n**Ticker:** [**META (Meta Inc)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=META&p=d)\n\n**Catalyst:** Reported earnings of $8.02 vs $6.68 expected. Revenue of $48.4B vs $47B,but guided revenue short of consensus and didn't provide FY25 revenue outlook (which triggered the reason for the selloff post-earnings after the close).\n\nTheir CAPEX announcement was $60-65B vs $52.4B expected, and stated they expected the single largest driver of expesive growth in 2025 as infrastructure costs due to higher OpEX and depreciation.\n\nAlso announced plans to grow META's AI team significantly.\n\n**Volume/Market Cap/Technicals:** Earnings move the stock on far less volume but the initial selloff after announcement was worth trading- interested in the $700 level today but not much beyond that.\n\n**Context:** Decent earnings but signals that there is more spending on the horizon- likely that the initial brutal selloff to $606 was from algos just reading the initial eye-popping CAPEX number and selling the company.\n\n**Sector Context:**There is a major next-level breakthrough that OpenAI is expected to release today that has agents performing on the same level as PHDs, Altman is meeting today with US government officials. META is the creator of Llama, which is another open source model compared to OpenAI's closed models.\n\n**Risks:** Deepseek has been the main threat involved, with competitors from China using distillation and other AI techniques to be able to train a far cheaper model that brings up the question of why our large tech firms are spending so much on GPUs. (I'm sure this is news to you /s)\n\n**Related Tickers:** FAANG stocks, SNAP, PINS, etc.\n\nOffhand:  Something worth remembering is that there is a $10B undersea cable that spans over 40K km that they plan to build (unknown what the cable is for), more details coming in 2025.

Revenue of $25.71B vs $27.23B expected. Most of this revenue miss came from miss in sale of EVs. \n\nTSLA announced interesting plans to lower the price of EVs in 2025 but also didn't give specific details regarding the production volume targets (as they have in the past), and also announced that there would be a paid robotaxi service in Austin in June. This puts them in competition with Waymo/UBER. Personally I think the vision-only approach is not viable in the long-run but hey, I'm no self-driving PHD. \n\nCAPEX was ALSO higher as with META due to spending increases from AI training infra costs and battery production capacity.\n\n**Volume/Market Cap/Technicals:** I'm mainly interested in the $375/$400 level, not too interested in going long despite the multi-day slide in price.\n\n**Context:** Main reason for TSLA's selloff was the lack of full-year guidance (it gives the subtext that it's too bad to release publically or it's up in the air). Political statements made by Musk may contribute to future issues for TSLA.\n\n**Sector Context:** Revenue shortfall was caused due to lower-than-expected vehicle deliveries/ increased sale incentives, 496K cars vs 507K exp. China's BYD is rapidly catching up, and the (possible) removal of the US EV tax credit may make EV's more expensive\n\n**Risks:** Mainly geopolitical- if the tariffs on EV vehicles imported to the US gets removed, TSLA will face fiercer competition from BYD. Also Elon Musk.\n\n**Related Tickers:** BYD (but mainly trades in China, TSLA isn't as impacted by AI news.)\n\n\n\n[**NVDA (NVIDIA Corporation) (in addition to ARM/AMD/SMH/SOXL/semiconductor stocks)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&p=d)\n\n**Catalyst:** The reveal of Deepseek has introduced an AI model that rivals existing solutions but was developed at around $6M. However there's a rumor that Deepseek is actually trained on 50K H100 NVDA gpus.\n\n**Yesterday after the close, there was an announcement Trump officials discussing tightening curbs on Nvidia's China sales.**\n\n**Volume/Market Cap/Technicals:** Overall, there's been a massive selloff since NVDA was $150 at the end of last week. Overall interested again if we hit $116, but low confidence we'll sell off again. \n\nCurrently long.\n\n**Sector Context:** Not much to really say about this beyond NVDA having the most advanced chips that are widespread for training because of the CUDA architecture- most people are doubtful that the TOTAL cost was $6M\n\nUS Officials are examining export restrictions but China will likely find a way to bypass them as they have previously.\n\n**Risks:** Mainly geopolitical, again. Obviously it's very difficult to restrict trade to a country that we have no military presence in or surround, and China is economically far more powerful than those we have attempted trade restrictions on in the past.\n\n**Related tickers:** (Mentioned above)\n\n**Earnings today:** AAPL, INTC, V,TEAM",

Nasdaq 100 futures were 0.3% higher, while S&P 500 futures was trading around the flatline.\n*****\n> Tech stocks on Tuesday led the S&P 500 higher and brought the Nasdaq Composite to a 2% gain. The two indexes made a comeback after incurring sharp losses on Monday in a sell-off spurred by the emergence of China\u2019s DeepSeek and the threat it poses to the artificial intelligence trade. Nvidia, which suffered a roughly 17% decline Monday, jumped nearly 9% on Tuesday.\n*****\n> \u201cAs far as the DeepSeek news over the weekend, at the end of the day today, there really hasn\u2019t been that much of an impact on a market-wide basis,\u201d Bespoke Investment Group co-founder Paul Hickey said Tuesday on CNBC\u2019s \u201cClosing Bell: Overtime.\u201d\n*****\n> The Fed\u2019s interest rate decision on Wednesday is now a focal point for investors, as well as Fed Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s press conference. Fed funds futures data reflect a nearly 100% certainty that the central bank will keep rates steady at a target range of 4.25% to 4.5%, according to CME Group data.\n*****\n> \u201cWhen it comes to the Fed, they\u2019re widely not expected to do anything tomorrow and that\u2019s a good thing. The less the Fed has to do, the better it is for the market, in our view,\u201d Hickey added.\n*****\n> Investors will be paying especially close attention to Powell\u2019s comments \u2014 his first press conference in President Donald Trump\u2019s second term. The two have had a contentious relationship dating back to Trump\u2019s first term. The president has already said he would \u201cdemand that interest rates drop immediately.\u201d\n*****\n> A volley of Big Tech earnings are due Wednesday afternoon, with Meta Platforms, Microsoft and Tesla issuing their quarterly reports.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/YJkzgI2.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx?t=sec_all)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S S&P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/XwbGPjI.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/syHoGi7.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/8qU5X7B.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/AM5j52H.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/gzhgYxd.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/QAom0eP.jpeg)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/rIfvDdx.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/TyT50UD.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS AFTERNOON'S AFTER-HOURS EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/68fW8MR.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/GCKndM1.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/371VldC.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/HQQYFc1.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/8NtSzOx.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/3pubZhc.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/b4kDG8Y.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/29/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-premarket-asml-baba-nvda-tmus.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n> **F5** \u2013 Shares soared nearly 14% on the heels of the application security company\u2019s fiscal second-quarter outlook beating Wall Street\u2019s expectations.

But it's certainly timely:\n\n>While training current advanced AI models requires immense computing resources, the shift towards real-time decision-making - known as inferencing - is poised to drive massive demand for additional computing power. According to McKinsey, 60-70% of AI workloads are expected to shift to real-time inference by 2030, creating an urgent need for low-latency connectivity, compute and security at the edge beyond current demand.\n\nNote that this is a [Verizon press release](https://www.verizon.com/about/news/verizon-unveils-ai-strategy-power-next-gen-ai-demands), so take it with a grain of salt. (I tried looking for the original McKinsey article but didn't find it).\n\nAssuming this projection is true, what stocks will benefit? \n\n* Telecom? AT&T went up big today?\n* Apple and other mobile related stocks?\n* Edge computing and cybersecurity?\n\nI asked Perplexity and this was the result:\n\n* NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA): NVIDIA is a leading player in edge computing and AI-optimized processors15. Its EGX Edge Computing Platform offers a comprehensive solution combining hardware and software for various edge computing applications1.\n\n* Arista Networks (ANET): Arista has developed a growing business providing network equipment for small, on-site data centers and infrastructure software for managing local networks enabled by edge computing2.\n\n* Nutanix (NTNX): Nutanix offers hardware for cloud and edge computing, with its hyper-converged technology ensuring high performance and agility for edge computing users2.\n\n* Ambarella (AMBA): Ranked as a top edge AI stock for 2025, Ambarella focuses on developing specialized hardware for edge computing applications3.\n\n* Cloudflare (NET): Strategically positioned at the intersection of AI, cybersecurity, and edge computing, Cloudflare is well-placed to benefit from these trends5.\n\n* Accenture plc (ACN): Accenture's \"Accenture One Edge Platform\" provides a unified solution for managing Cloud-Edge-IoT computing, positioning it to benefit from the growing demand for edge computing services7.",

But besides that, let me summarize my reasons of the purchase below, and you smart folks can comment/ critique me.\n\nFundamental reasons:\n\n* End of wars: I know, this is as unconventional opinion as me buying PLTR puts. But the whole ideology of new guv is reciprocal _\"scratch my back\"_, as opposed to Biden's _\"give us the oil or else..\"_. I see tightening fiscal spending, DOGE which includes defense, to some extent.\n* Valuations: this one is easy to see. Take PE, PS whatever metric. It's overvalued AF!! I doubt, if PLTR engineers are necessarily smarter than any Mag-7 tech guys. I'd bet the opposite rather. I've seen their products, trust me \ud83d\ude09, I know. The whole sales pitch is based on cronyism, arm-twisting, because those \"POCs\" (proof of concept testing of their software) is as corrupt as Pfizer's new drugs.\n\nTechnical/ options data facts:\n\n* Ridiculous run up in price - it is THE BEST preforming stock of 2024, and after a tiny dip, has sprung back to life. To me, this is plain euphoria.\n* Besides, it's a high beta stock. It's a good hedge against any softness in broad markets, which too are getting frothy. I see this PUT as a hedge against my tiny profits on index ETFs.\n* Ridiculous premiums. Implied volatility at 70-80%. This means even for a good 5% move in stock price, OTM options would barely move 10%. This is great news for sellers, but also for buyers, because the premium value is farely stagnant and \"safe\". I know, it won't stay like this forever but then it's volatile *for a reason* (i.e. earnings). \n* Based on previous guidance, the '24 earnings are not going to be as stellar as people expect. On that note, even if the earnings are good, as happened often to NVDA, market isn't ever satisfied. NVDA crashed even after 100% revenue growth! Same could happen to this one too.

There are 64 positions total and it's unrealistic that I'll be able to keep track of the performance/trajectory of that many companies. Buffet's \"pick a few winners\" comes to mind. I've been assuming the best thing to do is to slowly liquidate the one's I don't have a specific interest in, and buy VOO/SPY in their place.\n\nThere are many companies that I like and would like to hold on to (AAPL, AMD, AMZN, BRKB, GOOGL, JNJ, KO, MSFT, NVDA, NFLX, PG).

It's not that I don't know those companies, but it feels ignorant to hold onto them knowing that I won't have time to monitor their performance.\n\nIs there a best way to go about liquidating those and moving into an S&P 500 index?

Big corp. has control over it now, the more they have invested the more they have control over it. I knew this in the back of my mind when government slowly took control. The more BTC rises the more money needs to pour into it to get a return. \n\nAlt coins give you a nice return but I don't want to put in the search effort that can potentially be a dead coin months later. \n\nTwo of my friends in my discord also convinced me to pull from BTC, and there reasoning was, you need a lot of capital to make a % of what the returns were. \n\nWas also watching a podcast with tucker carlson and his guest said government and big corp want full control of BTC to pump and dump and use buyers liquidly to pay off national debt, take it with a gain of salt.\n\nI looked up how much BTC does on year average says 20%ish - which is very good, except exchanges take a huge cut of your profits. Even had coinbase+ still was losing on it. Switched to kraken instead. During the bull run I made a decent amount then sold for profits but lowkey if I had NVDA/PLTR I would profit off growth/fundamentals instead of an \"agreement\". \n\nLastly, my mentor himself who got me introduced to options even said he doesn't touch/hold BTC and hes been invested in the stock market for 10+yrs and made 10M+. \n\nJust my opinion would love peoples thoughts.\n\nLMK if you made a better return on stocks than BTC or if you think my idea is flawed?

    "selftext": "I can\u2019t wrap my head around AI and how it will impact the future of the Stock Market and investing. AI is rapidly growing and becoming more smarter each day. People are starting to use AI more and more in their day to day lives, however many companies are starting to incorporate AI into their systems and software to help make them generate more money. I do believe AI is the \u201cNext Big Thing\u201d when it comes to investing and even the real world. Just alone in the past 2 Years, AI has advanced and grown a significant amount and is only proving that it will continue to do so. I have my eye on two stocks that have been doing very well, TSMc and NVDA. Both of these companies work together and have a good relationship, and they both heavily rely on each other. TSMc manufactures and produces these H20 chips which are directly correlated to powering AI. As time goes on AI will become more powerful and will be of use a lot more which will create more demand. I have a TFSA open (opened January 2024, and I have invested the maximum allocated limit ($7000 CAD a year) I have invested all of the money that is in my TFSA into ETF\u2019s as it is one of the safest ways to invest and watch the money grow rather than depreciate because of inflation. In January 2026 when I can invest another $7000; I want to invest it all into AI. I was thinking of putting $3500 into TSMc and $3500 into NVDA. Both of these companies have been doing very well, and I do believe they will continue to do so. Is this a fair statement; and is it smart to invest in AI? I have played it safe in the last few years with putting all of my savings into ETF\u2019s, but now I want to take a bigger risk with the possibility of great return. Do you agree with this, and what stocks would you invest in that is related to AI? ",

They even fabricate weird scenarios such as if I had bought SPY at the very bottom of 2020 I'd be far ahead of where I am now. Even on the weekend at a party someone working in semi-conductors said he went all in on NVDA, TMSC etc and it's set them up for early retirement the argument was he could have retired earlier if he just invested in index funds!\n\nWhy is it that index fund investors refuse to believe that it is the \\*only\\* way \\*all\\* the time.

Right now about 60% of the portfolio equity is effectively tied to big tech/AI (mag7). I\u2019d like to cut that concentration, move to a fund-only setup, and keep costs low. Also somewhat of a hedge towards AI bubble burst.\n\nTarget mix (household level)\n\n* 75% U.S. large cap\n   * 50% core (S&P 500 or total market: VOO/VTI or equivalents)\n   * 25% \u201ctop-7 light\u201d allocation to reduce reliance on AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, AMZN, NVDA, META, TSLA (leaning XMAG; open to RSP if that\u2019s cleaner)\n* 25% diversifiers\n   * 10% value (VTV or IWD)\n   * 5% mid cap (VO or IJH)\n   * 4% small cap (VB or IJR)\n   * 6% international (VXUS or IXUS)\n\nHow I\u2019d implement\n\n* IRA: start with XMAG only (no S&P/total market in IRA) to cut the mega-cap tilt fast with no tax hit. \n* Taxable: keep the S&P/total-market core (VOO/VTI) and systematically exit all single-stock positions, prioritizing the big tech names first. Do it tax-sensitively with about $10\u201315k per year in realized gains, have dividends go to cash to fund the new ETFs, and aim to finish in roughly three years.\n\nMy rationale for this vs just holding S&P 500?\n\n* Keeps broad U.S. exposure but dials down single-name risk.\n* XMAG (or equal-weight) helps with the current top-heavy market.\n* The diversifier slice is pretty boilerplate imo. \n\nQuestions:\n\n1. Does this combo (core + XMAG + value/mid/small/international) seem like a sensible way to cut big-tech exposure? Not a full divestment (though I'd like to - it's too risky of a bet), but a reduction in overexposure.\n2. For placement, would you park value/mid/small in the IRA and leave international in taxable for the foreign tax credit, or is that not worth optimizing?\n3. Is \\~$10\u201315k per year in realized gains and a \\~3-year glidepath a reasonable way to unwind single stocks in taxable?\n4. End stage I'd like to remove the \"managed\" signifier from these two accounts entirely. Has anyone had luck asking for a reduced brokerage fee or flat/retainer model for the advisors? How would you recommend I broach this full strategy with them?\n5. Should I deploy something similar with my 403b (if the available funds allow)?\n6. Anything else I'm missing?",

In late-morning trading, NVDA shares rose 1.7% on the news.\n\nHere\u2019s why this matters for investors:\n\n* **AI Super-Factories & Data Centers**: Spectrum-XGS is designed to allow data centers to scale beyond their individual buildings. Nvidia calls it the **\u201cthird pillar\u201d of AI computing**, complementing vertical and horizontal scaling. Essentially, it enables massive AI infrastructures across cities, countries, and even continents.\n* **Performance & Efficiency**: The platform integrates with Nvidia\u2019s Spectrum-X, automatically adjusting networks, controlling congestion, latency, and telemetry. Nvidia claims performance nearly **twice that of their Collective Communications Library (NCCL)**.\n* **Enterprise Adoption**: Hyperscale companies like **CoreWeave (CRWV)** are already testing the tech, connecting their data centers to Spectrum-XGS Ethernet. Early adoption by industry leaders can indicate strong future demand.\n* **Earnings Context**: Nvidia will report next-quarter earnings **after market close on August 27**, with analysts projecting **EPS of $1.01** and **revenue of $46B**.\n\n**Investor Takeaways**:  \nFor long-term investors, this reinforces Nvidia\u2019s positioning in AI infrastructure, beyond GPUs. The launch highlights continued growth potential in data center and AI markets. It may also influence investment strategies in other hyperscale tech companies and cloud infrastructure providers.",

    "selftext": "Yes, this is actually true. I think people get it very wrong when they say \"you can't time the market\".\n\n  \nWhat you can not do is take out a bunch of calls at all time highs and expect to win. Or buy puts when the market crashes 20% in a week (April 2025) and expect to win.\n\nThat kind of market prediction is ***GAMBLING*** and will blow up your account.\n\nHow a professional times the market is by building positions that work in different ***SCENARIOS*** and then closing those positions when they \"work out\", which Warren Buffett called, workouts.\n\nRight now I have positions that:\n\n1. Go up if the market goes up.\n2. Goes up if the market goes down\n3. Goes up if Bonds go higher\n4. Goes up if Dollar, gold, bitcoin, yatta yatta.\n\nBefore the last few months I had a lot more diversity of positions. I had longed gold, longed bonds, longed MSFT, NVDA, (Ai), etc. all at different times.\n\nWhen NVDA crashed, I bought it.\n\nWhen it rallied, I sold it.\n\nThe point is that to time the market isn't because you're exactly right about time, price and direction.\n\nTiming the market is about being able to survive multiple outcomes, defending or cutting losers (defend if the investment makes sense, sell if the investment thesis changes); and selling your winners or let them ride.\n\nWhat doesn't work?\n\nMaking an exact prediction that makes-or-breaks your portfolio (blows up your account).\n\nWhat also doesn't work?\n\nBuy and hold with DCA at regular intervals (the usual \"Can't time the market crowd\").\n\nThose people will get a market average and probably not even a very good one because the market is near highs 80% of the time. So you'd get a high cost basis.\n\nTiming the market requires a little patience, good breadth of strategy, and some common sense. And that's it.",

Even if Gold went to $4000/oz that's only a 15% gain, which is a sneeze for NVDA etc. 15% isn't enough to protect a full equity portfolio and is nothing compared to where bonds will go in a market crash.\n\nEither way the monthly slow stochastic is the poker-tell on gold going back to the beginning when the gold window was closed. So there's no reason not to believe it now. When slow stochastic falls below 80 on the monthly chart that's always been the top. We're getting there soon by the current trajectory. One more month of no new high would meet the criteria.\n\nThe linear regression is maxed out, gold only breaks the monthly linear regression at tops as well and it broke above a couple months ago and never made a new high since, just like all previous tops before major bear markets.\n\nI will short Gold when it loses the monthly slow stochastic at 80.

    "title": "Today I made $1m gains by selling my entire Nvidia portfolio",
    "selftext": "Today marks perhaps my greatest investing milestone of all time!  The short story is I bought $36,000 worth of Nvidia over the course of 8 years. Last year I told myself once my account breaks $1m profit, I will sell the entire position, lock in the gains, and have a hell of a story to share for life.  Well today Nvidia hit a new all time high and I made that dream come true.\n\nBelow is a long version of how it all came to be: \n\nI first acquired Nvidia back in Feb 2017 and in a few lump sum purchases wound up with a total of 6,500 shares of NVDA.  My first purchase was for 1080 (in honor of my GTX 1080 I bought that year) and the share price at the time was a whopping $2.77!  My total investment around this time was $4000.  \n\nEdit: I looked up the actual purchase numbers and the number of shares was actually 27 at $110 but since Nvidia had split multiple times, the number shown in my report today was reflecting those splits.  End of edit \n\nBack in 2017 all the talk was about Crypto mining and I naively thought Nvidia was the way Bitcoin would be mined forever so I bought into the mantra \u201cduring a gold rush, buy the company selling the shovels\u201d.  This was around the time BTC hit $20,000 for the first time but it quickly collapsed and I was introduced into the volatility of the crypto world.  But I still held my Nvidia because I believed crypto was still at an early adoption stage.  \n\nOver the next few years I continued to buy small amounts of Nvidia, in chunks of 100 shares here, 900 shares here, and eventually had 6,000 shares by 2019.  The average cost of all of these were around $2-$8 in today\u2019s value.  \n\n2019 is a significant milestone for me because I made a major life decision to move to Puerto Rico.  This move was made for several reasons but one consideration is the 0% tax on capital gains from stock sales.  I didn\u2019t consider Nvidia being the one stock to move for but one reason for selling the whole lot was to lock in the 0% capital gains today \n\nI remember somewhere around 2019-2020 starting to think that GPUs and Nvidia specifically weren\u2019t going to be tied to crypto as much as it would be the hardware needed to power self driving cars.  The hype around Tesla was growing and crypto mining started moving away from personal computers and I learned GPUs were falling out of favor for more powerful ASIC mining rigs.  So my mentality moved from Crypto to Electric Vehicles.  Keep in mind, I really didn\u2019t know a lot about any of this and I view my Nvidia convictions at the time more as luck looking back.  \n\nThen in 2020 the Pandemic hit and we saw major sales of GPUs for gaming, virtual reality, and supply chain disruption and of course massive inflation.  Stocks across the board were super volatile but in general things went bonkers in the tech sector.  Tesla was killing it and Nvidia might have doubled during this time.  It still had not gone parabolic yet but I still just kept holding onto my initial position.  My portfolio wasn\u2019t really moving in any major way yet and in early 2019 I was actually slightly negative in my total Nvidia investment.  \n\nThen in 2023 we saw the first mainstream use cases for Ai started popping up.  I\u2019m in the photography and videography world so I noticed how disruptive image and video creation would be as soon as it hit.  All my colleagues were making images in Midjourney when the majority of my non photo friends had no clue what Ai image generation even was.  It ballooned quickly and that\u2019s when my mind set changed a third time. Now Nvidia was going to be needed for data centers and personal computers to power this new Ai revolution.  It wasn\u2019t about crypto or self driving cars anymore, it was about perhaps the biggest innovation humanity has seen since the internet was launched and the iPhone was revealed.  \n\nSeemingly overnight my portfolio was sky rocking.  Where just a few years prior, Nvidia was in the red for me, it quickly started carving out a large portion of my portfolio.  Once a liability, Nvidia now made up 10%, 20%, and 30% of my entire investment account and retirement funds.  There were days when I would log in to see I had made $100,000 that day and a week later it would swing down -$105,000.  It was pretty crazy to see a full year\u2019s worth of income bouncing around day by day in my account.  The temptation to sell had always been there since 2017 when I was up 20-100% but now I was up 4,000% and the temptation was even greater.  Every single one of my friends was telling me I had to take profits off the table.  I wound up holding.  \n\nThe last major purchase I made was in July 2021. I bought 400 shares for $14 which at the time was 3-5x what I had bought previously.  \n\nJump to June 2024 when Nvidia hit an all time high of $130.  My wife and I had just had our first child and my Nvidia position was hovering around $800,000 in total gains.  I knew I only had to make it to $160 per share to break the $1m mark and I told myself I would sell everything if that happened.  Of course the next month Nvidia corrected pretty hard and the reality of hitting $160 didn\u2019t seem possible until July 3rd 2025, nearly a year after I made my original decision to sell.  \n\nI should have sold everything on July 3rd but I didn\u2019t realize the trading day was shortened for the 4th of July holiday coming up. I also didn\u2019t setup any automated sell triggers since I wanted to ceremoniously do the trade myself.  It worked out in my favor as I was able to sell today at $163 and make a little more than the $1m cutoff I originally set to sell at. \n\nHere are the raw numbers:\n\nTotal invested: $36,352\nTotal sale: $1,059,591\nTotal gains: $1,023,238\nAverage cost per share: $5.60\nTime to materialize: 8 years and a lot of emotional rollercoasters!\n\n\nI know a lot of people get caught up in fancy investment options that feels more like gambling but hopefully this success story inspires those of you who are like me and just what to buy shares, hold them, and eventually offload them when the time seems right.  \n\n",

    "title": "How to find peace with my investment?",
    "selftext": "I've always been frustrated with active investing. I've beaten myself up for not making best decisions and it got me very depressed and irritated even though I am kinda profitable. I feel like I have never done enough research about the companies. I am constantly anxious about my portfolio. Which stocks should I hold? How should I manage the position? Therefore, I tried to study on various technical analysis trading strategies and try a lot of algo trading strategies so that I can have a fully mechanic system to make decision. Then I found that it is very difficult to beat s&p 500. Even if I can do it I think it's not worth the effort because the excess return is not that much and I can not guarantee that the system will consistently outperform the market so it's still walking on thin ice and still kind of discrteional because I need to make decisions on adjusting the strategy.\n\nSo two year ago I decided that I should just buy and hold the stock market index and get rid of all the stress. But I was not satisfied with 8\\~10% return and thought that I could leverage my exposure and made use of this opportunity after a bear market in 2022. It worked great until this april. I grew my account from 80k to 800k in two years (included my salary income). My basic strategy is to hold 3\\~4x leverage broad market future and will add more if there is a bit of correction (like 2023/12 and 2024/8). I planned to stop at 2M net worth so with 4x leverage it's another (2M/800k-1)/4\\*100%=37.5% and I'll be set. This april I blew up my account because I added on the way down and ended up overleveraged and got margin called. I went from 800k to less than 50k and realized that it's not really a sustainable strategy. Well, deep down I knew it's not sustainable but I wanted to make use of this post-2022 bull market cycle to the fullest because I hate investing so much that I want to make money faster and then sit with 5\\~8% return for the rest of my life.\n\nAfter this incident, I return to steady investment and am considering go back to active investing and trading. Currently I just hold SPY, QQQ, and NVDA. But I find that I beat myself up for taking profits too early or not buying more or not buying any other rallying stock like AVGO, AMD, and a ton of others. I get really mad to the point it affects every aspect of my life. Sometimes I think to myself is it really worth it if investing makes me financially successful but ruin my overall life. I am looking for any suggestion. Much appreciated.\n\nPS. I want to clarify that I am not sharing my story to just rant about my tramatized experience but to explain my thought process and show that I've tried many approaches in investing and that I've always tried very very hard to outperform the market. So I think I need more advice on mindset and psychology rather than \"find a strategy\" or \"just buy and hold spy\" kind of stuff. I am still open to this advice but I need more psychological aspect of it.",

    "title": "Buying Puts For A Correction",
    "selftext": "Last week, I sold a few stocks, expecting that the S&P 500 (SPX) (SPY) was due for a pullback/correction. Since then, the SPY made a triple top at 595.54 on May 20th, close to its Dec 2024 top of 609.07, and Feb 19, 2025 top of 613, \u2013 **this looks like a triple top unless NVDA takes it higher Wednesday / Thursday after earnings.** The SPY closed at 579.11 on Friday, the 23rd, almost 3% lower. I believe this is the start of a correction, which should likely take the SPY to around 540, about 10% lower.\u00a0**I plan to buy July 31st and August 31st, 540 strike price, SPY puts.**\n\n**Why am I bearish?**\n\n**There are the 4 main reasons:**\n\n1. The first and foremost reason for the weaknesses in bonds is higher borrowing costs for the US government. The 30-year treasury yield currently stands at 5.04% and seems likely to climb as the US Congress passes a budget with a running deficit of 124% of GDP, which increases the deficit further. It also assumes a large amount of customs duties as tariff income, and DOGE cost-cutting as savings. In my opinion, both are rosy projections and will probably exacerbate the deficit. Interest\u00a0**payments have surpassed defence as the largest line item on the government\u2019s books.**\u00a0The downgrade from Moody\u2019s will further increase interest rates, which will lead to a drop in the stock markets.\n2. The second is tariffs, which will show up in earnings in Q2-Q3; we can\u2019t escape them. Even as tariffs have whittled down to an estimated 15% to 20% on average, we shouldn\u2019t forget that last year, tariffs averaged 3-4%. This is a fourfold increase and will fuel inflation and stagflation, and affect corporate bottom lines if they\u2019re not passed on. And passing them on to customers would likely lead to a decrease in demand, which would still reduce corporate bottom lines. There are no easy solutions to tariffs.\n3. The third is an overpriced S&P 500 index, which at 5,803, yields an earnings yield of $260/5,803 = 4.48%. Why would you buy a risk-yielding asset for 4.48% when the 10-year U.S. treasury offers you 4.54%? The S&P 500 is priced at 22.3 times 2025 earnings, higher than the 10-year average of 19.5. Besides, the 19.5x multiple was when interest rates averaged closer to 3%. Simply, the risk premium is not enough for me.\n4. The fourth is the persistent weakness and uncertainty in economic data. Home sales are one example. According to Redfin, 56,000 home purchase contracts fell through in April 2025, or about 14% of sales, a level last seen in 2017. Existing home sales fell another 2% in April on top of the large drop in March of 5%, the largest drop since 2022. PMI readings for services and manufacturing came in at 52.3 for April, a decent number by any standards, but with accompanying color stating the obvious \u2013 **\u201cDetrimental concerns of tariff uncertainties on demand and supply chains.\u201d** Tariff uncertainty has led to the largest accumulation of inventories in the last 18 years. Given this buildup, it would only be fair to assume that the next two quarters will not grow as well as Q1-2025.\n\nUncertainty on tariffs (Friday\u2019s call for 50% tariffs on the EU and 25% tariffs on iPhones, not made in the US) increases volatility in bond and stock markets. Other, similar arbitrary executive actions, such as the revocation of Harvard University\u2019s ability to enroll international students, can also have economic repercussions. Currently, like so many other cases on immigration and tariffs challenging executive actions, this one too is in court. Which one could lead to a constitutional crisis? All of these suggest that bond markets could remain weak for a \u201cstructural credit risk\u201d reason \u2013 the US never had that problem, but I believe it could remain a problem during the Trump presidency. It already is a bearish indicator in the form of higher borrowing costs from international lenders not willing to lend at lower rates.\n\n**How much longer can Buy The Dip save the stock market? We are ignoring the dangers ahead.**\n\nThe CNN Greed and Fear index has gone from Extreme Fear to Greed in just one month and is flirting with Extreme Greed.\n\n**In my opinion, the fair value of the SPY is around 520 or 5,200 for the S&P 500, based on a P/E multiple of 20 x 260 per share = 5,200, and I\u2019ll buy Puts to hedge my portfolio for the dangers ahead.**\n\n\n\n*  ",

    "selftext": "/\\* posted in /stocks but was removed due to off-topic...\n\nIt is entertaining to read X recently. We have a lot of users calling for Fed to cut interest rates, in hope that the rate cut will push economic growth and reduce treasury yield. We have a lot of users calling for Fed to increase interest rate, so it makes USD more appealing and reduces treasury yield. Regardless, treasury yield keeps going up. The same story of basis trade and carry trade is playing again today.\n\nIt is debatable whether we want a stronger dollar or a weak dollar, but reducing treasury yield seems to be the common goal. How could we easily create more demands for U.S. treasury bonds, when both sides of the aisle embraces the deficit expansion to the core? Well, we can force people into buying treasury bonds, we can wage a war to scare people, or we can create some phantom demands. This is where the GENIUS act may come handy.\n\nThe grand scheme is to bring assets on-chain, which requires the players to escrow real-world-assets (RWAs) and issue tokens backed with it. Geez, this sounds like mortgage backed securities and ETF already. To trade those assets, we need currencies, mostly the stablecoins. The GENIUS Act requires holding of USD or treasury bonds, which the issuers will gladly support. Let us imagine that we move NYSE and NASDAQ on-chain and create a copy of all stocks, we suddenly create demand for USD, treasury, and stocks from some users that can't access the U.S. market. Even our dear general Kim can tornado his stash and buy Apple at that time.\n\nWait! This already happened! Kraken tokenized AAPL, NVDA and TSLA today. Many other crypto firms have worked on RWA for years, including stocks, game skins, etc. GAINS even created a 100x leveraged stock trading platform until they halted it due to heavy admin burden to monitor stock earning, dividends, splits, acquisitions, etc.\n\nSo we are likely to see a concerted effort to push assets on-chain in the coming months or years, which will benefit stocks like COIN, HOOD, XYZ, PYPL, and other players, and cryptos such as LINK. Electronic stablecoin payments for daily life is another direction, and I wonder how that will affect V and MA. The damage to both may take years though.\n\nToo bad I didn't scoop HOOD at low, but I bought all above anyway.",

HSBC also downgraded the stock to \"reduce\" from \"hold\".\n\nIn earnings, retailer Target (TGT.N) fell 3.5% after slashing its annual forecast due to a pullback in discretionary spending.\nWolfspeed (WOLF.N) tumbled nearly 70% following a report that the semiconductor supplier was preparing to file for bankruptcy within weeks.\n\nDespite the losses, U.S. stocks have had a solid month so far. The S&P 500 has climbed more than 17% from its April lows, when Trump's reciprocal tariffs roiled global markets.\n\nA pause in the tariffs, a temporary U.S.-China trade truce and tame inflation data have pushed equities higher, although the S&P 500 is still about 3% off its record highs.\n\nBrokerage Morgan Stanley upgraded its stance on U.S. equities to \"overweight\", saying the global economy was still expanding, albeit slowly, amid policy uncertainty.\n\nMeanwhile, bitcoin scaled a fresh all-time high of $109,481.83.

Fiber is the backbone that powers it all, and demand is only accelerating.\n\n2. Global Upgrade Cycle is Underway\nMuch of the world still runs on outdated copper infrastructure. From the U.S. to emerging markets, we\u2019re seeing a global shift toward fiber-based connectivity, supported by both public and private capital.\n\n3. Geopolitical Tailwinds & National Security\nFiber infrastructure is now a matter of national interest. Western governments are investing billions to build secure, domestic data routes and reduce reliance on foreign tech.\n\n4. Physical Layer of the AI Boom\nWhile many are focused on AI software and semiconductors (NVIDIA, etc.), I\u2019m targeting the physical layer\u2014what all AI traffic runs on. Fiber networks, switches, optics, and routers are essential.\n\n5. Diversified but Targeted Exposure\nHere\u2019s how I\u2019m structuring it:\n\nCore Fiber/Optics Holdings: CIEN, GLW, NOK, CSCO, ADTN, LITE, JNPR\n\nEdge & Cloud Security: CRWD, PLTR\n\nDefense & Infrastructure: LMT, KTOS, ESLT\n\nEmerging Market Exposure: EIDO (Indonesia), INDA (India), EWW (Mexico)\n\nFuture-Tech Speculatives: IONQ, RGTI\n\nEnergy, Semis, and Other Anchors: XOM, NVDA, QCOM, CCJ, BHP\n\n\nI\u2019ve structured monthly allocations based on conviction level while keeping exposure balanced across sectors that support the fiber and data ecosystem.\n\nWould love to hear thoughts\u2014especially from others with long-term infrastructure or data-driven theses. Anyone else betting on the \"digital plumbing\" of the future?",

In fact, every instance of the VIX surpassing this threshold has been followed by significant market rebounds.\n\nAll the negative factors projected tariffs, absence of deals, and lack of tax cuts are currently being priced into the market. None of these have materialized yet. Similarly, no positive developments have occurred, except for the trillions of investments flowing into our country. Any hint of a deal or policy shift could ignite a strong rally.\n\nI\u2019m no market oracle, so I\u2019m taking a measured approach by DCA into positions. And anyone here who claims to be one is mistaken because the future is uncertain. Notably, two prominent hedge fund managers initiated new positions in NVDA today. Why? Because, despite the unpredictability of policy decisions, they recognize the value in NVDA at $100. Reflecting on 2022, we experienced several dead cat bounces until the bottom was reached in October.\n\nReviewing my purchases from 2022: \ufffc\n\t\u2022\t1/24: 50 shares at $393\n\t\u2022\t2/4: 10 shares at $409\n\t\u2022\t3/8: 5 shares at $383\n\t\u2022\t5/23: 20 shares at $360\n\t\u2022\t8/2: 5 shares at $374\n\t\u2022\t9/13: 10 shares at $361\n\t\u2022\t10/17: 10 shares at $335\n\t\u2022\t12/7: 4 shares at $361\n\nAs you can see, I was down pretty bad all year but remained consistent. I own four ETFs, and even if this market declines another 90%, I will still be okay.\n\nRemember, the best opportunities often arise when fear peaks. While others hesitate, this could be the moment to consider buying. Markets have a history of rebounding, and those who act decisively during downturns often reap the rewards.",

    "selftext": "BARRON'S\n\nNvidia Stock Is Falling. Not Even Chip Exemption Saves It From Broad Slump.\n\n2:28 PM-Apr 3\n\nNVDA\n\nBy Adam Clark\n\nNvidia looks set to fall sharply following President Donald Trump's imposition of sweeping tariffs on imports to the U.S. The chip maker escaped specific levies but the wider market reaction and fears of Chinese retaliation are set to drag on the shares.\n\nNvidia shares were down 3.2% at $106.93 in the Thursday premarket having tumbled 5.7% at $104.15 in after-hours trading. The stock rose 0.3% during Wednesday's session.\n\nThe tariff announcement wasn't quite as bad as it could have been for Nvidia. Trump said the levy on imports for Taiwan - where Nvidia's chips are mostly manufactured - will be set at 32%. However, the White House published a fact sheet after Trump's announcement that said semiconductors would not be subject to that reciprocal tariff.\n\nThat doesn't mean chip tariffs are off the table entirely. Products such as semiconductors, pharmaceuticals and lumber will be addressed separately, a senior administration official said.\n\nThe other major concern is likely to be potential retaliation from Beijing, with Chinese goods now facing total duties of 54% after the latest tariff announcements.\n\nAmong other chip makers, Advanced Micro Devices fell 5.8% in after-hours trading and Broadcom was down 6.3%.\n\nMeanwhile, Nvidia on Wednesday said its Blackwell computing platform set performance records in tests for inferencing - the process of generating output from Al models - carried out by MLCommons, an open engineering consortium.\n\nThere has been speculation over whether Nvidia's dominant position in Al chips would weaken as the focus shifts from training Al models to inference. The company has pushed back hard against that, noting inference makes up around 40% of its data-center revenue and is growing fast. It says that its NVL72 server system delivers a fourfold improvement in Al model training but up to a 30 times improvement in inference compared with previous systems.\n\nThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

    "selftext": "Goal: Retire in 10 years, living modestly on dividends\n\nI began investing in March, 2020. Had about $60k in my savings account and knew nothing about investing. Got bored during Covid and started my investment journey, just randomly picking individual stocks. \n\nIn June of 2020, I read an article about Mercedes-Benz partnering up with a company that I had never heard of before to power their automated driving functions. At the time, my thought was if a company like Mercedes-Benz trusts this company, I should as well. So at the time, I randomly invested $500 in the company, NVDA. Over the next few months I would buy a few hundred dollars worth here and there. As of yesterday, I had invested a total of around $27000 over the years, and the value had grown to about $136000. I had accumulated 1,152 shares after the splits. Yesterday, I sold 850 shares for $102,000.\n\nNow, my goal is to retire in 10-15 years. This will give me 20-25 years of service towards my pension. I currently make $104k a year, which should equate to about $4500 for my pension when I reach retirement age. I have no debt and no kids. \n\nSo my goal is to re-invest the $102000 in safer ETFS with the goal of converting these to income based investments when I decide to retire at 45 or 50 years old.  I currently invest $1k per month in my brokerage, $1k a month in my 403b, $585 a month in my rothIRA, and $100 in my 457b. \n\nIf you were me, with my goal of retiring in 10 years, how would you go about doing this?\n\nMy current thought is this: Invest $50k in voo, $30k in VGT or IYW, and invest $20k in JEPQ. (I know I will owe around $13k in taxes for the gains on NVDA). Then I was thinking that I should stop investing in my 403b, and instead invest $2000 per month in additional JEPQ and let it drip. Ive run the numbers on dripcalc and even if there is no dividend growth and JEPQ stays flat, this initial $20k plus $2000 a month for 10 years should leave me with around $49000 annually in dividends before taxes, which would be plenty to live off of in SE Asia, where I plan to move. My investments in VOO and VGT could sit there and compound. With the addition of my pension and hopefully SS, I should be set for life when I reach 60 years old, with a monthly income around $7k not including the gains in my Roth and from VOO/VGT in my brokerage that I would likely convert to SCHD when I reach 60 years old as well. \n\nThoughts? Should I invest the $2k per month in VOO/VGT instead of JEPQ for the next 10 years to focus on growth and not have the tax burden? Should I continue investing in my 403b to lower my taxable income even though my goal is to gain as much income as possible to live off of from the ages of 45-60? ",

ETFs are supposed to be a work around to the wash sale rule, but I can't find anything definitive anywhere that states whether single-stock-specific ETFs would fall under that umbrella and be similarly excluded from the wash sale rule. \n\n And yes, I know I can just comfortably buy puts on a semiconductor ETF with large NVDA exposure, but I think NVDA will greatly underperform others in the sector and would like more direct exposure.\n\nAll thoughts are welcomed, and I thank you all for your time.",

    "selftext": "So in every major market downturn a lot of companies are brought down even those that may not be expected. \n\nFor example in the Dot com bubble in addition to tech stocks you had the collapse of Enron and MCI Worldcom. \n\nIn 2008 in addition to bank stocks you had insurance such as AIG, big three automakers, General Electric etc.\n\n2020 you had a lot of retailers that had been struggling for years file for bankruptcy.\n\nHere are my predictions of who/what will be impacted:\n\n*  Crypto - Too many meme coins and speculation. There will be a massive correction due soon not sure if as severe as 2022 but its coming\n* Office Space REITS- some of these have recovered but I don't see their finances improving anytime soon as return to office has been very gradual. Also recent federal cuts will hurt demand especially in suburban office space markets.\n* Meme Stocks in particular Tesla and Game stop. Telsa's PE ratio is way too high and Musk's recent antics have hurt future sales prospects. Gamestop also has way too high of a PE ratio. In a downturn people will turn away and its price will collapse\n* Broadcast /Cable companies - These companies are struggling with cord cutting. In a downturn this will be first thing many consumers cut. Comcast is very vulnerable. Also any regional sports stocks such as MSGE will get hit. \n* Almost every remaining regional retailer that is publicly traded. I'm not sure how many of these are honestly left but any non national retailer that does not have a decent web presence will have a decent chance of not surviving next downturn. \n* AI related stocks. Companies have been spending hundreds of billions for their AI buildout. There will be cuts to AI budgets that not only impact NVDA and AI oriented stocks, but any REITs that own data centers, power companies doing build outs \n* Oil and Gas companies. US production has increase significantly even after blip during pandemic. Due to higher drilling costs in the US expect any dip in oil price to wipe out a lot of producers especially if they are too leveraged in debt. ",

It has a wide range of individual stocks like AAPL, AMD, AMZN, AVGO, AXP, BRKB, COST, CRM ... V, WBA, WMT (28 stocks and funds) for example, with share quantities ranging from 1 to 20+ for the individual stocks. Most, have really nice returns, but the quantity of each tends to be so small I question whether it would be wise to sell most and invest in a mix of SCHD, FXAIX, SCHG, FTEC, and FBGRX. I've already cleaned up a bunch of small quantity positions, but there are still a ton of them. I reinvested the proceeds into the funds above.\n\nWould it make sense to sell most of these remaining small positions and concentrate those funds in selected ETFs and MFs as mentioned above? I've pretty much settled other Roth and IRA accounts into a mix of S&P 500, dividend ETFs, and growth funds. But this one account remains to be cleaned up and is worth around $135k-ish currently. \n\nI'm not generally a fan of bond funds, but do have about 6% in FXNAX. I've consolidated other stocks I sold into FXAIX and SCHD, about 27% and 29% respectively. And I put some in several growth funds too like FBGRX and FTEC, about 16% between them. So the remaining 20+ stocks comprise maybe 20-25% of the account. While I kinda like having BRKB, MSFT, NFLX, NVDA, META, etc., the share quantities are so low that I wonder if I would be better off selling them and reinvesting them in my core ETFs and MFs above. \n\nFor the record, our current income is from Social Security, RMDs, and my wife who will likely work for 6 to 8 more years. I've been retired for years. The majority of our funds are in different Roth and 403b Roth and 403b IRA accounts. The account in question above is a rollover from a job years ago.",

    "selftext": "This topic has been brought up so many times here but I had to bring it up again...\n\n\nSo many times I hear how risky they are, which i do agree, they are. \n\nBut what I dont understand is that if one wants to short a particular stock what is the big deal if they sell a naked call option and collect a premium while doing so?\n\n\nFor example. \n\nIf i want to sell a naked call option on NVDA at say 100 expiring next week and collect a premium of $500 while doing so and the stock jumps to $115 and i am assigned. Well now I'm assigned at $100 a share along with $500 in premium i collected, so in reality my cost basis if I include the $500 is $105 but it's now trading at 115. So I'm down a $1000\n\nNow if i hold onto that short and wait it out because I'm still believing it's going to drop and it does drop it's a win win....\n\nWhat am I missing...\n\nI know stocks can go to infinity but if one wants to short a stock what's wrong with selling a naked call???",

    "selftext": "**I bought Marvell Technology (MRVL) for around $114 adding to my January purchases for around $107.**\n\nI missed buying it in the low 90s, waiting to see if their transformation to an AI chip company was complete. Having a cyclical past with non-performing business segments made me hesitate, besides far too many promises have been made in the AI space only for investors to be disappointed.\n\nMarvel has been walking the talk, Q3 results in Dec 2024 were exemplary, and guidance even better.\n\n**Hyperscaler demand**\n\nWith a planned Capex of $105Bn for 2025, Amazon confirmed on their earnings call that the focus will continue on custom silicon and inferencing. Amazon and Marvell have a five-year, \u201cmulti-generational\u201d agreement for Marvell to provide Amazon Web Services with the Trainium and Inferentia chips and other data center equipment. Amazon is an investor in Anthropic with plans to build a supercomputing system with \u201chundreds of thousands\u201d of Trainium2 chips called Project Rainier. DeepSeek's model's success does suggest a further democratization of AI, as inference starts gaining prominence in 2026.\n\n**Q3-FY2025**\n\nMarvell beat revenue estimates by 4% and adjusted EPS estimates by 5.5%, \n\nFQ3 revenue grew 6.9% YoY and 19.1% QoQ growth to $1.52Bn, helped by a stronger-than-expected ramp of the AI custom silicon business.\n\nFor Q4, it expects revenue to grow 26.2% YoY and 18.7% QoQ to $1.8Bn at the midpoint, beating previous estimates by 9.1% and adjusted EPS estimates by 13.5%. \n\nManagement indicated that it could exceed the full-year AI revenue target of $1.5Bn and likely beat the FY2026 AI revenue target of $2.5Bn as well.\n\nAdjusted operating margin \u2013 29.7% V 29.8% last year, and better than the management guide of 28.9% with even higher guidance for Q4 at 33%.\n\nAdjusted net income \u2013 $373 Mn or 25% of revenue.\n\n**Management has also committed to GAAP profitability in Q4**.\n\n**Custom Silicon**\u00a0**Could Boom** \u2013 There are estimates of a TAM (Total Addressable Market) of $42 billion for custom silicon by CY2028, of which Marvell could take 20% market share or $8Bn of the custom silicon AI opportunity. Broadcom too has talked up a potential TAM of $70Bn and I hope to see more details in the 4th quarter calls. On the networking side, the TAM is another $31 billion.\n\nOppenheimer analyst Rick Schafer thinks that each of Marvell\u2019s four custom chips could achieve $1 billion in sales next year. Production is already ramping up on the Trainium chip for Amazon, along with the Axion chip for the Google unit of Alphabet. Another Amazon chip, the Inferentia, should start production in 2025. Toward the end of next year, deliveries will begin on Microsoft\u2019s Maia-2, which Schafer hopes will achieve the largest sales of all.\n\n**Key weaknesses and challenges**\n\nMarvell carries $4Bn in legacy debt, which will weigh on its valuation.\n\nThe stock is already up 70% in the past year, and is volatile \u2013 it dropped $26 from $126 to $100 after the DeepSeek and tariffs scare, in the past ten days, before bouncing back.\n\nCustom silicon, ASICs (Application Specific Integrated Circuits) have strong competition from the likes of Broadcom (AVGO) and everyone is chasing market leader Nvidia (NVDA). Custom silicon as the name suggests is not widely used like an Nvidia GPU and will encounter more difficult sales cycles and buying programs.  \n\n\nMarvell has other segments, which account for 27% of the business that are not performing as well; but they\u2019re going full steam ahead to focus on the custom silicon business and expect total data center to exceed 73% of revenue in the future. \n\nDrops in AI buying from data center giants will hurt Marvell.\n\nOver 50% of Marvell\u2019s revenue comes from China, and it could become a victim of a trade war.\n\n**Valuation:**\u00a0The stock is selling for a P/E of 43, with expected (as per consensus analysts' estimates) earnings growth of 80% in FY2025 and 30% after that for the next two years \u2013 that is reasonable. It has a P/S ratio of 12.6, with growth of 25%. It\u2019s a bit expensive on the sales metric, but with AI taking an even larger share of the revenue pie, this multiple could increase.",

    "selftext": "So I have two main financial goals:\n\n1. Buy my first home - and not just any home, something's actually nice and in a good area.\n2. Grow my wealth as much as possible.\n\nTo that end, this has been my strategy thus far:\n\n* Max out my pre-tax accounts (HSA, 401k). These are invested in the total world stock market.\n* Maintain $15-20k at all times in my Fidelity CMA (as sort of a combo checking account & emergency fund). These funds are invested in a treasury-only MMF.\n* Contribute towards my downpayment fund, which is basically 15% of the price of the most expensive home I could reasonably purchase. This is a brokerage account where I invest in 1-3 month treasuries exclusively.\n* Contribute the remaining to another brokerage account, for long-term growth; with the understanding, however, that I may tap into it earlier if needed. This is invested purely in VTI and SCHX (I tax loss harvest between the too) with a small alocation for short term speculation (i.e. I put like 2% of the account into NVDA and TSM after the recent crash)\n\nI'm wondering if I should re-evaluate this, however. As my individual income is in the high $200ks, pretty much any short term gain I make is taxed to death. At best, my downpayment fund is keeping up with inflation; but it's certainly not growing. Also - my employer & 401k brokerage allows for the mega backdoor roth strategy, as well as in-service rollovers to a Roth IRA.\n\nWith that in mind, I'm wondering if I should move a portion of my downpayment fund into Roth, instead. That way the interest I'm making isn't taxed, and can be a small part of my long term growth. I figure when the time comes to buy a home, I can withdraw the principal but leave the gains in there.\n\nObviously I know I can't simply \"move\" the funds into my Roth IRA per se, but I could max-out my after-tax 401k contributions for the next few months, and then use my maturing bonds in my downpayment fund to either buy more stocks in my brokeage account, or cover short-term cash needs (to make up for the extra income that's going into the roth account now).\n\nSorry to spew all this at you, but I'd love to get your thoughts.",

    "selftext": "I understand how to utilize them in typical bogleheaded manner but I want to understand more about the deeper underlying mechanisms with authorized participants (I.e. large banks) and understanding their market value vs NAV as well as who has actual stock ownership and the implications of such?\n\nI was reading that the price of an ETF is just its market value, I.e. the last price it was bought or sold at etc.  Can someone explain however for something like SPY which has holdings of some % of NVDA what happens in hypothetical NVDA just disappeared off the face of the planet?  What would force the ETF price to adjust if most folks are just buy and hold on the ETF?  What happens with the authorized participant as they are technically the true bag holder on Nvda?\n\nWhen statistics say for example that Nvda is mostly owned by institutional investors would that also include the banks actually holding NVDA as authorized participants of an ETF?  Is there any implications of banks having enough stocks for voting rights etc?  Isn\u2019t it more accurate to say that *many folks* that have Nvda through proxy are effectual bag holders even if not directly.  If hypothetically everyone bought and held just passive index ETFs would stock prices ever really change?  When Nvda stock prices plummet or rally what entities are making these active trades?  I assume authorized participants involved in open ended index tracking ETF do not buy and sell underlying stock assets based on anything except conforming to some index?\n\n\n\nBesides ETFs I understand institutional investors to be things like mutual funds, hedge funds, sovereign wealth funds, endowments, pensions, insurance etc.  I see things like Calpers and understand their goal to provide retirement for public workers but see that probably their investment ROI does not beat S&P.  Why do retirement funds like this exist in government when on paper it seems a 401k with S&P holdings can be more \u201cefficient\u201d.  Is it just the power of compound growth and money without the tax drag?  That the reason these funds end up \u201cwealthy\u201d is mostly that they have longer life spans then people which die and then get their inheritances taxed (often at income tax rate given the 10 year rule on traditional IRAs)?  Who are the actual folks or organizations in power that actually move market prices more than retail I.e. bad news about Nvda. Price plummets at market open?\n\nThe reason I bring up NVDA is the issue of extreme market concentration in even passive index funds that although many folks want to close their eyes and go la la la just buy S&P etf I want to understand more about how the market really works. \n\nhttps://franklintempletonprod.widen.net/content/oe2aswpq2c/original/market-concentration-ex9.png",

The H100\u2019s architecture enables AI models to train at unprecedented speeds, while the H800 variant meets regulatory requirements in markets like China. The evolution from the A100 to the H100 has significantly accelerated AI capabilities, with GPT-3 models learning four times faster than before. Nvidia\u2019s market strength is reinforced by deep integration with tech giants like Google, Amazon, and Microsoft, ensuring continued demand for its products. As AI models become more sophisticated and data-intensive, Nvidia\u2019s GPUs remain central to pushing the limits of what AI can achieve.\n\nDeepSeek\u2019s AI model V3 has disrupted the industry by achieving high-performance AI training on Nvidia\u2019s H800 chips at significantly lower costs. Traditionally, training advanced AI models has required billions in investment, but DeepSeek\u2019s approach challenges this assumption, demonstrating that high-level AI training can be done with minimal resources. This efficiency could lead major tech firms to question Nvidia\u2019s high pricing, pressuring the company\u2019s ability to maintain its premium margins. If DeepSeek\u2019s success encourages more companies to seek cost-effective alternatives, Nvidia may need to justify its premium pricing or risk losing market share.\n\nDespite its strong position, Nvidia\u2019s financial foundation has key vulnerabilities. Nearly half of its data center revenue comes from a handful of major tech firms, including Microsoft and Meta\u2014companies that are now investing in developing their own AI chips to reduce dependency on Nvidia. While Nvidia\u2019s dominance in both software and hardware makes it difficult to replace, emerging competitors like AMD and DeepSeek are introducing cost-effective alternatives. DeepSeek, for example, trained its model with only $5 million, a fraction of the billions typically required for Nvidia-powered training. With a P/E ratio three times the industry average, Nvidia\u2019s valuation remains highly sensitive to changes in AI spending and broader market trends. A slowdown in AI-related investments or increased competition could significantly impact Nvidia\u2019s stock price.\n\nFor years, Nvidia was synonymous with AI growth, with investors believing that any advancement in AI would translate directly into gains for Nvidia. However, this perception is shifting. The emergence of cost-effective AI models and alternative chip suppliers, including DeepSeek, AMD, Google, and Amazon, challenges Nvidia\u2019s \u201cThere Is No Alternative\u201d (TINA) status. Concerns about pricing, licensing restrictions, and geopolitical factors, including U.S. government restrictions on chip exports, further complicate Nvidia\u2019s outlook. Investors are increasingly questioning whether Nvidia can sustain its premium pricing in a market where competition is growing, leading to potential valuation recalibration.\n\nThe AI industry is undergoing rapid transformation, with cost-efficiency becoming a critical factor in decision-making. Nvidia\u2019s high-end GPUs have long been the gold standard, but rising costs are prompting companies to explore alternatives. AMD\u2019s MI300 series, for example, offers competitive AI processing power at lower costs, making it an attractive alternative for firms looking to diversify suppliers. Broadcom is also gaining traction in AI networking, while DeepSeek\u2019s focus on affordable AI chips threatens Nvidia\u2019s dominance. As these competitors gain market share, Nvidia\u2019s ability to maintain its pricing power and market stronghold may diminish, forcing it to adapt to a changing landscape.\n\nDeepSeek\u2019s advancements have ripple effects across the AI supply chain. If AI training costs continue to drop, tech giants may slow down their AI-related capital expenditures, impacting Nvidia\u2019s growth trajectory. Furthermore, the shift toward more cost-efficient AI solutions could reduce demand for Nvidia\u2019s high-end chips, altering market priorities from premium performance to affordability. This evolving landscape presents both risks and opportunities for Nvidia. While it may face increased competition, Nvidia\u2019s leadership in AI infrastructure and software solutions still gives it a competitive edge. However, it must adapt to changing market demands to sustain long-term growth.\n\nNvidia\u2019s market dominance is being challenged as the AI industry evolves. The rise of DeepSeek, along with increased competition from AMD, Broadcom, and major tech firms developing in-house chips, raises concerns about Nvidia\u2019s pricing power and long-term growth. Recent market shifts have already led to a $600 billion drop in Nvidia\u2019s market value, the largest single-day loss in U.S. stock history.\n\nIf the AI market prioritizes efficiency over expansion, Nvidia could see reduced demand for its high-end GPUs. However, its history of innovation, strong AI infrastructure, and ongoing R&D investments position it well to adapt. While some analysts view recent market dips as a buying opportunity, the competitive pressures and changing industry dynamics mean Nvidia must continue evolving to maintain its leadership in AI hardware.\n\n# TL;DR: Nvidia remains a dominant force in AI hardware, but emerging competitors like DeepSeek, AMD, and Broadcom are challenging its pricing power and market dominance. DeepSeek\u2019s AI model demonstrates that high-performance AI training can be achieved at significantly lower costs, potentially reshaping the AI ecosystem. Nvidia\u2019s dependence on a few tech giants and its high valuation make it vulnerable to market shifts, while increasing competition suggests that its long-term growth may face headwinds. However, Nvidia\u2019s innovation and market leadership still offer strong potential, provided it adapts to the evolving AI landscape.\n\n  \nShifting Market Perception \u2013 The narrative is changing from \u201cAI success = Nvidia success\u201d to a more fragmented AI ecosystem where efficiency, affordability, and alternative suppliers are gaining traction.\n\n* Financial and Competitive Pressures \u2013 Nvidia depends heavily on a few major tech companies, faces emerging competition from AMD, Broadcom, and DeepSeek, and has a valuation significantly above industry norms, making it vulnerable to market corrections.\n* Shifting Market Perception \u2013 The narrative is changing from \u201cAI success = Nvidia success\u201d to a more fragmented AI ecosystem where efficiency, affordability, and alternative suppliers are gaining traction.\n\nNvidia has established itself as a dominant force in the AI hardware industry, with its H100 and H800 chips powering some of the most advanced AI models, including ChatGPT and DeepSeek.

If DeepSeek\u2019s success encourages more companies to seek cost-effective alternatives, Nvidia may need to justify its premium pricing or risk losing market share.\n\nDespite its strong position, Nvidia\u2019s financial foundation has key vulnerabilities. Nearly half of its data center revenue comes from a handful of major tech firms, including Microsoft and Meta\u2014companies that are now investing in developing their own AI chips to reduce dependency on Nvidia. While Nvidia\u2019s dominance in both software and hardware makes it difficult to replace, emerging competitors like AMD and DeepSeek are introducing cost-effective alternatives. DeepSeek, for example, trained its model with only $5 million, a fraction of the billions typically required for Nvidia-powered training. With a P/E ratio three times the industry average, Nvidia\u2019s valuation remains highly sensitive to changes in AI spending and broader market trends. A slowdown in AI-related investments or increased competition could significantly impact Nvidia\u2019s stock price.\n\nFor years, Nvidia was synonymous with AI growth, with investors believing that any advancement in AI would translate directly into gains for Nvidia. However, this perception is shifting. The emergence of cost-effective AI models and alternative chip suppliers, including DeepSeek, AMD, Google, and Amazon, challenges Nvidia\u2019s \u201cThere Is No Alternative\u201d (TINA) status. Concerns about pricing, licensing restrictions, and geopolitical factors, including U.S. government restrictions on chip exports, further complicate Nvidia\u2019s outlook. Investors are increasingly questioning whether Nvidia can sustain its premium pricing in a market where competition is growing, leading to potential valuation recalibration.\n\nThe AI industry is undergoing rapid transformation, with cost-efficiency becoming a critical factor in decision-making. Nvidia\u2019s high-end GPUs have long been the gold standard, but rising costs are prompting companies to explore alternatives. AMD\u2019s MI300 series, for example, offers competitive AI processing power at lower costs, making it an attractive alternative for firms looking to diversify suppliers. Broadcom is also gaining traction in AI networking, while DeepSeek\u2019s focus on affordable AI chips threatens Nvidia\u2019s dominance. As these competitors gain market share, Nvidia\u2019s ability to maintain its pricing power and market stronghold may diminish, forcing it to adapt to a changing landscape.\n\nDeepSeek\u2019s advancements have ripple effects across the AI supply chain. If AI training costs continue to drop, tech giants may slow down their AI-related capital expenditures, impacting Nvidia\u2019s growth trajectory. Furthermore, the shift toward more cost-efficient AI solutions could reduce demand for Nvidia\u2019s high-end chips, altering market priorities from premium performance to affordability. This evolving landscape presents both risks and opportunities for Nvidia. While it may face increased competition, Nvidia\u2019s leadership in AI infrastructure and software solutions still gives it a competitive edge. However, it must adapt to changing market demands to sustain long-term growth.\n\nNvidia\u2019s market dominance is being challenged as the AI industry evolves. The rise of DeepSeek, along with increased competition from AMD, Broadcom, and major tech firms developing in-house chips, raises concerns about Nvidia\u2019s pricing power and long-term growth. Recent market shifts have already led to a $600 billion drop in Nvidia\u2019s market value, the largest single-day loss in U.S. stock history.\n\nIf the AI market prioritizes efficiency over expansion, Nvidia could see reduced demand for its high-end GPUs. However, its history of innovation, strong AI infrastructure, and ongoing R&D investments position it well to adapt. While some analysts view recent market dips as a buying opportunity, the competitive pressures and changing industry dynamics mean Nvidia must continue evolving to maintain its leadership in AI hardware.\n\n# TL;DR: Nvidia remains a dominant force in AI hardware, but emerging competitors like DeepSeek, AMD, and Broadcom are challenging its pricing power and market dominance. DeepSeek\u2019s AI model demonstrates that high-performance AI training can be achieved at significantly lower costs, potentially reshaping the AI ecosystem. Nvidia\u2019s dependence on a few tech giants and its high valuation make it vulnerable to market shifts, while increasing competition suggests that its long-term growth may face headwinds. However, Nvidia\u2019s innovation and market leadership still offer strong potential, provided it adapts to the evolving AI landscape.",

    "selftext": "\n\n* **DeepSeek's Claims:** Released AI models (R1 and R1 Zero) claiming OpenAI-level performance with lower costs and less advanced chips, causing semiconductor stocks to drop.\n* **Scalability Concerns:** Experts doubt whether DeepSeek\u2019s approach can scale to meet the demands of growing AI adoption.\n* **U.S. Export Ban:** Restrictions on advanced chip exports to China have spurred innovation but limit scaling and next-gen model development.\n* **AI Adoption Still Early:** AI applications in industries like transportation, medicine, and home automation remain nascent, requiring advanced chips for growth.\n* **Nvidia\u2019s Strong Position:** Despite short-term stock dips, Nvidia\u2019s dominance in GPUs and projected growth (EBITDA from $34.5B in 2024 to $166.8B in 2027) highlight its long-term potential.\n* **Investment Case:** Continued demand for high-performance chips ensures Nvidia\u2019s relevance in the expanding AI market.\n\nNvidia is currently navigating a challenging landscape as DeepSeek, a company specializing in AI models, has unveiled its DeepSeek R1 and R1 Zero models. These models claim to rival OpenAI's performance at significantly lower training costs, just $6 million, using less advanced chips. The announcement has sent shockwaves through the semiconductor industry, leading to declining stock prices for companies like Nvidia. DeepSeek's claims suggest a potential shift in AI development priorities, focusing on cost-efficiency rather than the procurement of high-end chips. However, experts remain skeptical about the scalability of this approach. As AI adoption grows, so will the need for advanced chips capable of handling increased query volumes and more complex use cases.\n\nThe U.S. export ban on high-end chips to China has added another layer of complexity to the situation. While the ban aims to limit China's access to advanced technology, it may have inadvertently spurred innovation, forcing companies like DeepSeek to achieve more with less. Despite this, scaling AI models and developing next-generation solutions still require significant computational power, which advanced chips uniquely provide. With each GPU generation, improvements in power efficiency and performance become essential for addressing growing demand, particularly as AI applications expand across industries like transportation, medicine, and home automation.\n\nAI adoption is still in its infancy, with significant growth potential across various sectors. Autonomous vehicles, for instance, represent less than 0.002% of the global car fleet, highlighting the vast untapped opportunities for AI-driven technologies. Similarly, the use of AI in medical research, molecular science, and household appliances remains limited, indicating substantial room for expansion. As these applications evolve, they will require a robust supply of advanced chips to achieve cost-effective scalability and enhanced efficiency. Even with advancements in cost-efficient training methods, scaling AI adoption to meet global demand will depend on continued investment in high-performance chips.\n\nNvidia remains well-positioned to benefit from this dynamic. While its stock has faced short-term pressure, the company's dominance in the GPU market and its projected growth underscore its long-term potential. Analysts estimate Nvidia's EBITDA to grow from $34.5 billion in 2024 to $166.8 billion by 2027, with free cash flow rising at a similar pace. This growth justifies Nvidia's premium valuation and positions it as a critical player in the AI-driven future. The competition spurred by DeepSeek and similar initiatives ultimately reinforces the need for advanced chips, ensuring Nvidia's relevance and profitability in the evolving AI landscape.\n\n**TL;DR:** Despite DeepSeek's claims of cost-effective AI model training with less advanced chips, Nvidia's leadership in the GPU market and the growing demand for advanced chips to scale AI applications make it a compelling long-term investment opportunity.",

    "selftext": "Let me tell you a story...\u00a0 It will have a point and I will give my investment ideas, but I need to establish the context first.\n\nI used to be in the Tech Industry. For all intensive purposes I retired about a decade ago. My claim to fame was being speaker, trainer and consultant using Web technologies. Yes the original Web, which I started developing for in 95.\u00a0\n\nI was just starting to work out of University as an IT consultant for UBS then SBG. My boss was tasked with figuring out this WWW thingy for the bank. I was there and thought, this is cool. As I dug into Netscape and Java (with a big J) I learned that this Web stuff could be really cool. I created in 96 a stock trading application using Microsoft OLE technologies embedded into Netscape with an Apache CGI backend. This was presented at a Swiss IEEE Data Highway conference (go ahead and check if you don't believe). I bought a Sun pizza box had a dedicated Internet connection in my apartment and wrote server extensions for Apache using the new CGI technology.\n\nI am explaining the background because it allowed me to speak about Web and Java development in Silicon Valley at SD Conferences. I also attended the one and only Netscape developers conference. I was tasked by my boss to meet up with the Netscape folks to talk about making a browser deal with UBS. Here is where things became interesting.\n\nAs I was sitting in the imprunto meeting with Netscape I sensed they did not give a rats ass that UBS wanted 25,000 licenses of Netscape. The guy said, \"yeah we don't really want to deal with you because Deutsche Telekom wants a million licenses\".\u00a0 I was a bit shocked and then indicated to them that I will take that information back to UBS. I also at the time asked about the Netscape Browser and the OLE interface. They said, \"yeah ignore that its Microsoft technologies and they are old school, you should learn Java and focus on that.\" As I listened to the various sessions and the conceit I thought yeah this was the peak, everything will go downhill from here. \n\nI was convinced by that because as I was speaking at the various conferences in Silicon Valley I noticed a pattern. Silicon Valley people are arrogant as hell and they like to circle jerk each other. Meaning if you are not part of Silicon Valley you are nothing. For only the best work in Silicon Valley at least in their minds. \n\nOk so now lets into the current situation and what I think will happen. Sun, Netscape and so on lost the thread when they focused on high end combining it with their arrogance. Sun boxes and Netscape were extremely expensive. They lost to Apache, PHP, and MySQL. They lost to an open source guy called Linus Torvals who was hacking out in Finnland!\n\nThe irony that a Chinese developer sitting in China has done a Linux is absolutely hilarious. When I see the Techbros and their financiers like Marc Andressen losing AGAIN you just have to chuckle. Remember Andressen was the loser in Netscape. \n\nBut all is not lost because now the fun begins. When the dot com world collapsed onto itself we began to develop real web applications. Microsoft which was ignored by Netscape, released something called XMLHttpRequest object which made the Web of today possible. Those were the real glory days of Web after the dot com collapse.\n\nSo what does that mean for investing? Simple, essentially the entire dot com leaders collapsed and do not exist anymore. The exception being CSCO, but it was a long and hard road. What came out we didn't know at the time. However we do know the companies that thrived were the ones who used the WWW technology to offer a product. Think mapping, think social media, think google mail.\n\nMy main play would be ARM as they provide hardware that is cheap, efficient and could be scaled. Intel was not immediately as good as SPARC, but the Linux folks fixed that. I also think you need to look at companies that use AI to deliver a product. I am not talking about a chat bot. I am thinking something that offers a service to the retail that is something you want. And no I am not talking about Microsoft and its code pilot. I think it would be a mobile player. I am even thinking it could be somebody that has augmented glasswear stuff. You wear some glasses and have AI giving you information based on your actions.\n\nI am not arguing that DeepSeek will win. On the contrary who knows if they will win, and it does not matter. What matters is that DeepSeek showed that the Silicon Valley argument of more hardware, more billions and more energy is pure and utter BS! A Chinese Open Source Developer proved that. There will be others that will do the exact same because we know we can. That is what should make Silicon Valley absolutely petrified and make you step away from the leaders with a ten foot pole.",

Nvidia\u2019s dominance isn\u2019t just about hardware\u2014it\u2019s deeply tied to its software ecosystem, particularly CUDA, which is the gold standard for AI and machine learning development. This ecosystem is entrenched in research labs, enterprises, and cloud platforms worldwide.\n\n3. People have to understand the risk that comes with DeepSeek coming out of China. There will be major adoption barriers from key markets as folks worry about data security, sanctions, government overreach etc. \n\n4. US just announced $500b to AI infrastructure via Stargate. The government has substantial resourcing to subsidize or lower barriers for brands like Nvidia.\n\nCritiques tend to fall into two camps\u2026\n\n1. Nvidias margins are going to be eroded \n\nTo this I think we have to acknowledge that while lower margins and demand would impact the stock both of these are speculative. \n\nIncreased efficiency typically increases demand. And Nvidias customers are pretty entrenched, it\u2019s def not certain they will bleed customers. \n\nOn top of that Nvidia\u2019s profitability isn\u2019t solely tied to selling GPUs. Its software stack (e.g., CUDA), enterprise services, and licensing deals contribute significantly. These high-margin revenue streams I would guess are going to remain solid even if hardware pricing pressures increase.\n\n2. Open source has a number of relative advantages\n\nI think open source is heavily favorited by startups and indie developers (Open source is strongly favored by Reddit specifically). But the enterprise buyer doesn\u2019t typically lean this way.\n\nOpen-source solutions require significant internal expertise for implementation, maintenance, and troubleshooting. Large enterprises often prefer Nvidia\u2019s support and commercial-grade stack because they get a dedicated team for ongoing updates, security patches, and scalability.",

    "selftext": "Jensen Huang, Nvidia CEO delivered the CES (Consumer Electronic Show) keynote on January 6th, 2025. An immensely popular event, with about 140,000 attendees, the charismatic Jensen drew a packed crowd. Jensen did not disappoint.\n\n# There were three big announcements\n\n# New Gaming Cards\n\nNvidia\u2019s new line of\u00a0RTX 50 Series gaming graphics cards is based on the company\u2019s Blackwell chip architecture. Considering the massive leap Blackwell has made over Hopper, its previous iteration in data center applications, getting it to work in gaming is a huge deal \u2013 a massive improvement with superior rendering and higher frame rates for gamers.\n\n# Digits\n\nThe Linux-based desktop computer with the GB 10 Grace Blackwell Superchip with a CPU and GPU. A first in its history at $3,000 \u201cPlacing an AI supercomputer on the desks of every data scientist, AI researcher, and student empowers them to engage and shape the age of AI,\u201d Huang said.\n\nIt may seem like a niche product for high-end engineers/professors/scientists and researchers, but I think it\u2019s a deliberate and excellent strategy to evangelize the product, through the folks who can develop use cases and apps that can further the market for cheaper at scale mass Digits in the future.\n\nThis is straight from the Nvidia playbook from the last two decades \u2013 they have always involved the scientific and research community from the start. I can bet a large number of these are going to be distributed free to campuses.\n\nI think Digits will turn out to be a very consequential product for Nvidia \u2013 with several billion in revenue in a few years. But forecasts aside, what\u2019s key is that Digits uses a scaled-down version of Nvidia\u2019s Grace AI server CPU technology. It\u2019s packaged in a Mac Mini-sized form factor with the help of Taiwan-based\u00a0**MediaTek**, which Huang commended for its expertise in building low-power chips.\n\nQuoting Tae Kim from Barron\u2019s who authored an excellent book on Nvidia\n\n>Over time, the logical move for Nvidia would be to scale down this CPU further for consumer Windows laptops. By integrating its graphics expertise, MediaTek\u2019s power-saving capabilities, and the efficiency of Arm-based CPU technology, Nvidia could create a processor that offers leading graphics for gaming and high performance for productivity, along with long battery life. While prior Arm-based Windows PCs have struggled with software compatibility, Nvidia\u2019s top-notch software engineering could make it work.\n\nHuang strongly hinted that the introduction of Digits was a precursor to the PC market, even as there are questions about why Nvidia chose Linux over Windows \u2013 and we should hear more about that at their GTC conference in March.\n\nIt could shake up the moribund PC market, which has been suffering from a lack of growth rates after COVID-19. Desktop PCs and laptop computers still generate large revenues for\u00a0**Intel**\u00a0and\u00a0**Advanced Micro Devices**, the primary makers of x86-based processors \u2013 a legacy that could give way to ARM-based processors, which Apple uses. Analysts expect Intel to generate $30 billion in revenue from its client computing business in 2024, according to FactSet, while AMD has $6.7 billion in revenue in its client segment.\n\nBillions of potential new revenue are at stake for Nvidia, which is forecasted to make about $180Bn in sales in the 12 months ending January 2026. While data center takes up the largest share of revenue at about $150Bn of that pie and gaming, auto, and professional visualization (Omniverse) take the rest, a new source would help a great deal when data center revenue growth slows down.\n\nIn the past two years, Nvidia has monopolized the AI data center market with the best-designed, highest-performing chips. Nvidia would likely make a significant dent in the PC market as well as the new paradigm in edge computing with all the computing power and constant innovation and upgrades at its disposal.\n\n# Cosmos\n\nThe third announcement was for COSMOS \u2013 a significant improvement over their Omniverse and the biggest catalyst/enabler of \u201cPhysical AI\u201d, I\u2019ll write a separate note on that.\n\n**Nvidia is firing on all cylinders and that\u2019s great news for consumers.**",

Well he wrote this book a year ago, before people knew wtf quantum was... and basically got the readers hyped about quantum but says like 100 times in the book that we won't see this stuff happen until 2050. Maybe a decade away for some things in the pharma industry. Very refreshing to get a non-Wall Street person talking about the space, and frankly, he probably knows best given he's a worldly known Physicist. I read this over the holidays, it was a great read fyi (not an ad, just saying).\n\n\u00a0\n\n**Short Quantum thesis by Martin Shkreli:** [https://x.com/MartinShkreli/status/1876950624824177127](https://x.com/MartinShkreli/status/1876950624824177127) Think what you want of the pharma bro, but he wrote an excellent piece on why he is short quantum. TLDR: the best quantum companies are GOOG and IBM. Both are too large to see any financial impact from quantum on the stock. However, these two stocks have the balance sheet to support massive/costly R&D in quantum that these smaller \"quantum\" companies don't have. He makes the interesting point that these companies went public (IONQ, Rigetti, D Wave, etc) because they are running out of money and need to raise money and dilute shareholders to stay afloat. IF they were that good, they would have been scooped up by IBM and GOOG already. He also notes the best quantum companies (outside of GOOG and IBM) are still private, so average people like you and I can't invest in them anyways. Basically the shitty quantum companies are the ones that are public right now.\n\n\u00a0\n\n**And most importantly, the computers don't work well. IONQ and RGTI computers are actually down right now.** [https://x.com/MartinShkreli/status/1879607624569872443](https://x.com/MartinShkreli/status/1879607624569872443) & [https://x.com/MartinShkreli/status/1879896705434591582](https://x.com/MartinShkreli/status/1879896705434591582)\n\nThese computers aren't even online right now for IONQ and RGTI.\n\n\u00a0\n\nBasically this all seems like an emotional yolo into quantum. Most people don't understand it and the commerical applications are years and years, probably decades away. I would invest with caution as this has bubble written all over it , imo. Yes, I am short right now. ",

    "selftext": "As a newer investor coming from the ETF side of things, a \"value\" approach has been my first way of learning to look at companies. I'm thinking more about their story, how they make money, whether they do it consistently, P/E ratio, EV/EBITDA, low debt, etc. \n\nI lurk around on r/ValueInvesting and have gotten some good book recommendations, although I mostly use them for reference rather than reading them in their entirety. \n\nThe S&P 500 was at a P/E ratio of over 100 in 2008 when the market crashed, although there have been pullbacks and recessions with lower P/Es than at current levels. All that to say, maybe the market is overvalued by traditional valuation metrics. I guess I'm trying to understand why many users and even successful YouTubers like Joseph Carlson and others recommend many high P/E companies. I gather that these companies have a sustainable competitive advantage with a lot of growth priced in. I'm talking about companies like SPGI, ASML, GOOGL (this actually seems like a growth company with decent valuations), UBER, ARM, NVDA, AVGO, META, FTNT, AMD, etc.\n\nThese companies seem to have a good moat, great CEO's, strong balance sheets but a lot of growth priced in. Frankly, it seems like one could do quite well with companies like these. I've underperformed significantly (thankfully with small positions for the purposes of gaining experience) picking stocks with what I thought were traditional value metrics, companies like HDSN, JILL, ALB, CP, VIRC, etc. Granted, I don't really feel like I have a circle of competence and didn't look too much into how these companies make money. I'll admit that I was riding mostly on the convictions of others, which I recognize is a major issue in itself that I intend to correct going forward. \n\nSo for those of you who invest in individual companies and have had success, here are some questions;\n\n1) Is it productive to differentiate between growth and value companies?\n\n2) Is it fruitful to look for companies with a 10-15 P/E ratio and other \"deep value\" metrics or is traditional value investing dead altogether due to modern age computing power?\n\n3) Does the rise in popularity of index investing exacerbate irrationality in markets to the point where valuations don't matter?\n\nAny insights are greatly appreciated. I read most of my books through osmosis but am probably going to have to get over that. I look forward to good discussion and your replies. Have a great weekend!",

    "selftext": "I currently own about 64 shares of Nvidia stock at about $114 avg price. I will probably have the opportunity to make a full 100 shares within the next month or two, and I\u2019ve been considering doing that just to run a covered call strategy with it while continuing to hold NVDA long-term.\n\nWould I be better selling calls weekly or monthly? \n\nFrom what I can see I should be able to generate at least $350 to $400 a month or so which would be up to $4800 annualized. \n\nAs of now, I believe I would just periodically reinvest the money directly back into Nvidia to build the position long-term. I also do realize I will pay capital gains on the money received from selling the calls. I have a small business with many legitimate write offs to hopefully help with that part.\n\n I understand the concept more or less and have used the strategy in the past with moderate success on much cheaper stocks. I also understand that I can buy back, roll up down, etc. \n\nAny thoughts or suggestions on ways to improve or optimize this strategy would be appreciated, thanks!",

    "title": "Nvidia: Expect Valuation To Soar Higher On 2025's AI Spending Increases",
    "selftext": "# Summary\n\n* Nvidia\u2019s 2024 revenue surged by 86% to $113.3 billion, with operating income doubling to $71 billion.\n* Hyperscalers are expected to increase AI-focused capital expenditures by 50% in 2025, reaching $300 billion.\n* Nvidia\u2019s next-generation Blackwell architecture offers up to 15x performance improvements, securing its 90% market dominance in AI GPUs.\n* Competitors like AMD and Broadcom struggle with ecosystem integration and software optimization, solidifying Nvidia\u2019s lead.\n* Analysts project a 50x earnings multiple and a target price of $225 per share for 2025.\n\nNvidia Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA) enjoyed unprecedented financial success in 2024, driven by a wave of hyperscaler investments in data center infrastructure for artificial intelligence. Revenues soared by 86%, reaching $113.3 billion, while operating income more than doubled to $71 billion, signaling the company\u2019s dominance in the AI sector.\n\nDespite such robust growth, concerns over a potential slowdown are misplaced. The global push toward AI and machine learning shows no signs of waning. Leading technology giants like Amazon Web Services, Microsoft, Meta Platforms, and Google are significantly expanding their high-performance computing capabilities to meet the surging demand for generative AI, large language models, and advanced AI applications.\n\nIn 2024, hyperscaler capital expenditures on data centers totaled approximately $200 billion. For 2025, this figure is projected to rise by 50%, hitting $300 billion. According to Morgan Stanley, Amazon and Microsoft are set to lead this spending spree with investments of $96.4 billion and $89.9 billion, respectively. Google and Meta will closely follow, allocating $62.6 billion and $52.3 billion to their AI-driven infrastructure.\n\nThis aggressive investment is underpinned by statements from top executives. Google\u2019s CFO noted that while growth in capital expenditures won\u2019t match the leap between 2023 and 2024, further increases are expected. Similarly, Meta\u2019s CEO Mark Zuckerberg highlighted plans for significant growth in infrastructure spending. Microsoft, too, has committed $80 billion for AI-oriented data center construction in fiscal 2025.\n\nNvidia, with its 90% share of the AI GPU market, is perfectly positioned to capitalize on this surge in spending. The release of its next-generation Blackwell architecture in early 2025 promises substantial performance gains, including up to 2.5 times the training performance of its Hopper GPUs and as much as 15 times higher inference capabilities in select benchmarks. These advancements, paired with Nvidia\u2019s proprietary CUDA platform, reinforce its unassailable ecosystem of hardware and software solutions.\n\nCompetitors like AMD and Broadcom continue to face hurdles. AMD\u2019s MI300X GPUs, while promising on paper, have failed to deliver comparable performance due to software deficiencies. Broadcom\u2019s custom silicon projects, although intriguing, lack the versatility and support ecosystem Nvidia GPUs provide. Consequently, neither competitor poses a significant threat in the near term, with meaningful competition unlikely before 2026 or 2027.\n\n# TL;DR\n\nNvidia\u2019s remarkable 2024 growth, fueled by hyperscaler investments, will continue as AI spending surges 50% in 2025 to $300 billion. With its dominant 90% GPU market share and groundbreaking Blackwell architecture, Nvidia is well-positioned for further success.\u00a0\n\n*Price at Publication:* **$144.12**",

    "selftext": "**Hi everyone!**\n\nIn 2024, I decided to try a simple but consistent investment experiment: I invested\u00a0**\u20ac10 per week**\u00a0in the \"Magnificent 7\" (MSFT, AAPL, AMZN, GOOGL, NVDA, TSLA, and META). The goal was to understand how regularity and patience could yield results. I confess that I rebalanced twice, but I can\u2019t remember when exactly (oops!).\n\nThis wasn\u2019t my only investment, and its sole purpose was to see how it would perform over the course of a year. It\u2019s not an allocation I plan to keep in the future.\n\n**Results**:\n\n* I invested a total of\u00a0**\u20ac520**\u00a0throughout the year.\n* The current portfolio value is\u00a0**\u20ac706.80**, which means a profit of\u00a0**\u20ac186.80**\u00a0(+35.92% return).\n\n**Key Takeaways**:\n\n* **Consistency works:**\u00a0Investing small amounts regularly helps avoid timing the market. DCA (Dollar-Cost Averaging) for the win!\n* **Stock selection matters:**\u00a0The \"Magnificent 7\" are heavily exposed to the tech sector, which had a strong year, but that also means higher volatility.\n* **Patience is key:**\u00a0I didn\u2019t touch the investments throughout the year, and that was crucial for these results.\n\nThis was a personal experiment that helped me learn more about the impact of regular investing and how the market can reward those who stick to a disciplined strategy.\n\nIt\u2019s just my experience\u2014not right, not wrong\u2014just mine, and I wanted to share it with you!\n\n**Discussion**:  \nHas anyone else here tried investment \"experiments\" like this?

    "selftext": "Hope everyone had a great week and a great start to the New Year! I was able to contribute another $1,000 to my brokerage account this week. Here's the key highlights.\n\n**December 30 Balance:** $129,157.32  \n**January 3 Balance:** $134,381.97  \n**Weekly Contribution:** $1,000\n\nThis week was a roller coaster. My account dropped as low as $127,242.76 before rebounding on Friday. I try not to check my account every day to avoid the temptation of panic selling. The volatility can be tough to watch, but I try to stay focused on the long-term prospects of my holdings.\n\nWhen I had my cash available, I purchased more MSTR since it took a substantial dip. I lowered my cost average down to $417.78, which is a realized loss of 18.7%. I will continue adding to this position as long as it is lower than my cost average. I now hold 49.138 shares.\n\nI am also going to explore write some covered calls against a few of my holdings. I do this in my retirement account regularly, but I haven't done it much in my brokerage account because of tax implications. I will post updates if I decide to do that. I would love to generate some extra cash to begin buying some non-tech stocks and diversify the portfolio. As many of you stated last week, I certainly felt the effects of not diversifying when the NASDAQ was hammered in the middle of the week. I like some of the ideas people proposed last week, and I have added them to my watch list. If you have any other ideas that look good for 2025, please let me know in the comments.\n\nIt's also becoming very tempting to sell my LUNR contracts. They are up 650% since I purchased them, but I am trying to hold them through the launch later this month. We will see if that actually happens, or I might sell off two of my contracts to lock in gains and let the other two ride.\n\nHere's an overview of my holdings. The only change was adding more MSTR this week.\n\n**Current Holdings:**  \n\\- QQQ: 101.714 shares worth $52,832.41  \n\\- AMZN: 101.565 shares worth $22,769.85  \n\\- MSTR: 49.138 shares worth $16,690.21  \n\\- PANW: 80 shares worth $14,660.00.  \n\\- NVDA: 100.374 shares worth $14,501.03  \n\\- LUNR Call: 4 contracts (March 2025, $6 strike) worth $6,300  \n\\- CRWD: 10.753 shares worth $3,860.54  \n\\- META: 3.867 shares worth $2,338.10  \n\\- TGTX Call: 3 contracts (February 2025, $37 strike) worth $429.00\n\nDate\tAccount Balance (USD)\n\nNov 8. 2023\t$42,657.61\n\nDec 1, 2023\t$49,538.85\n\nJan 2, 2024\t$55,890.56\n\nFeb 1, 2024\t$64,396.23\n\nMar 1, 2024\t$67,122.01\n\nApr 1, 2024\t$70,912.97\n\nMay 1, 2024\t$71,600.58\n\nJun 3, 2024\t$83,827.81\n\nJul 1, 2024\t$91,752.40\n\nAug 1, 2024\t$91,752.40\n\nSep 3, 2024\t$98,283.78\n\nOct 1, 2024\t$105,701.36\n\nNov 1, 2024\t$115,481.05\n\nDec 2, 2024\t$127,155.13\n\nJan 3, 2025     $34,381.97\n\nLooking forward to seeing how the next few weeks unfold.

    "selftext": "Hey everyone!   \n  \nI am a longtime lurker, but I am hopeful people may feel inspired by financial journey over the last year or so.   \n  \nFor background, I\u2019m an assistant principal at a local elementary school, and my wife runs her own tutoring and education consulting business. Together, we\u2019ve been focused on building a secure financial future while balancing busy lives. This post is part of my ongoing journey of consistent investing. As of November 13, 2023, I began contributing $1,000 weekly to my brokerage account. Previously, I had dabbled in investing since 2021 but without consistency.  I deposited a little extra money here and there, but I wasn't consistent in my approach and didn't prioritize it. This is my story and an update on where I stand today.\n\n**Portfolio Snapshot as of December 2024:**  \n  \nStarting Balance (November 13, 2023): $44,403.12  \nCurrent Balance (December 26, 2024): $131,615.84\n\n**Monthly Contributions:** $4,000 - $5,000 (depending on the number of weeks per month)\n\n**Current Holdings:**  \n\\- QQQ: 101.714 shares worth $53,151.66  \n\\- AMZN: 101.565 shares worth $22,725.16  \n\\- MSTR: 45.279 shares worth $14,942.07  \n\\- PANW: 80 shares worth $14,894.40  \n\\- NVDA: 100.374 shares worth $13,752.24  \n\\- LUNR Call: 4 contracts (March 2025, $6 strike) worth $5,000  \n\\- CRWD: 10.753 shares worth $3,817.20   \n\\- META: 3.867 shares worth $2,319.46  \n\\- TGTX Call: 3 contracts (February 2025, $37 strike) worth $825.00\n\n**Table of Progress:**\n\n|Date|Account Balance (USD)|\n|:-|:-|\n|Nov 8. 2023|$42,657.61|\n|Dec 1, 2023|$49,538.85|\n|Jan 2, 2024|$55,890.56|\n|Feb 1, 2024|$64,396.23|\n|Mar 1, 2024 |$67,122.01|\n|Apr 1, 2024|$70,912.97|\n|May 1, 2024|$71,600.58|\n|Jun 3, 2024|$83,827.81|\n|Jul 1, 2024|$91,752.40|\n|Aug 1, 2024|$91,752.40|\n|Sep 3, 2024|$98,283.78|\n|Oct 1, 2024|$105,701.36|\n|Nov 1, 2024|$115,481.05|\n|Dec 2, 2024|$127,155.13|\n\n**Lessons Learned:**\n\n\\- **Compounding Takes Time but Works:** I\u2019ve started noticing compounding effects really kick in. Some months, my portfolio\u2019s growth outpaced my monthly salary, which is both surreal and inspiring.\n\n\\- **Volatility is Real:** Watching significant swings in my portfolio value is tough. To manage this, I\u2019ve adopted a \"set it and forget it\" mindset and avoid checking my account daily.\n\n**- Stay Consistent:** It\u2019s easy to get caught up in market trends and daily life, but staying consistent with contributions has been the most rewarding strategy.\n\n**Why I\u2019m Sharing:**\n\nI hope to inspire others who might be hesitant about investing. I realize $1,000 isn't possible for everyone - I'm extremely lucky to be able to do this - but I think starting with even $50 a week or a month can be impactful. Financial independence is achievable with consistency, discipline, and patience. \n\nFor transparency, I focus solely on my brokerage account in these posts, even though I also fully fund my Roth IRA, 403(b), and my wife\u2019s self-directed 401(k). We also maintain a hands-off Acorns account with about $60,000. I\u2019ve thought about moving that money to Fidelity but appreciate the safety and simplicity it offers.\n\n**Looking Ahead:**\n\nStarting in January, I plan to post each week to give a closer look at my journey. I\u2019ll share more details on my strategy and lessons as they unfold.\n\nIf you have questions about my approach, portfolio, or anything else, feel free to ask! Thanks for following along, and good luck on your own investing journeys!",

I've recently started dabbling in options, and want to get some advice on (i) Am I pursuing the right strategies for my profile, and (ii) How to bring more structure to my stock picking.\n\nFor context, have \\~$300K liquid assets, \\~$78K of which is in a Schwab account and the rest in a HYSA (not including money in my checking for daily living expenses/rent/etc.). Am currently in an MBA program that is being paid for by my employer, so don't need to worry about tuition, but obviously don't have a salary right now. My employer had a strict trading policy - ETFs / indices only, no single names due to MNPI concerns. Hence why I've only been able to take on a more active approach to investing in the 2nd half of 2024. \n\nMy investing basically follows 4 strategies:\n\n1. SPY - \\~60% of portfolio\n\n2. A couple stocks that I think are great companies *qualitatively*, mostly from a consumer standpoint (e.g., Amex, Costco) - \\~8% of portfolio\n\n3. Growth and meme stocks that I see a lot of buzz about on Reddit and other social media (NVDA, MSTR, RKLB, KULR, MVST, TLRY) - \\~25% of portfolio\n\n4. Selling covered calls on some of the above - anywhere between 30-180 DTE, at strike prices I'd be comfortable taking profit\n\nThe rest is sitting in cash in my brokerage (need to figure out where to deploy this). \n\nI'm looking for stock screening criteria that I can apply to potential investments. The list I have in my head so far is something like (i) Positive and growing revenue (even better if profitable); (ii) Low P/E ratio relative to competitors; (iii) Some positive dividend yield but not more than a few percentage points; (iv) Consensus analyst rating of Buy, or Hold if I really believe in the company. \n\nDo the above criteria look right / are there any big ones I should add? At my age, I consider myself growth investor, although that's tempered somewhat by my innate risk aversion.

    "selftext": "I started investing in November 2017 and I was doing great during the bull run. Unfortunately everything crashed down in 2021 and I spent 3 years kicking myself thinking I should've just put everything on SPY and forget it. In the last few months I can finally say that my portfolio is beating the index again. At some point during December 2022 my portfolio was -35% while in comparison if I had put it on SPY I would still be positive. This traumatized me a bit and now that I am finally beating the index over the last 7.2 years I have three main thoughts:\n\n1. Is the volatility worth it?  \n2. I'm up on some names anything from 200-800% which makes them seem overvalued and makes me hesitate on buying more of those companies  \n3. Feels like a 30%+ haircut can happen at any moment and Im just dreading when it comes. \n\nSummary:  \nPortfolio is up 193% since inception (Nov 2017) sitting at 595K  \nBreakdown:  \nTsla: 45%  \nPltr: 25%  \nBtc: 17%  \nClpt: 6%  \nAbcl: 3%  \nRest less than 5%: Beam, Clsk, Nvda, AMD, Meta\n\nI think for now im going to either lower my average on the few names im still down or just slightly up and believe strongly like Beam or Meta OR just buy SPY and turn that into Tsla BTC or Pltr only if there is a big correction in those names.

I am thinking of the following alternatives:\n\n- sell DELL and LVMH and invest everything in QQQ and IWQU with a 70/30 split\n- sell DELL, keep some in CASH, invest the rest in other high risks names that I have been following. \n\nThe reason of these two alternatives is that I prefer not to touch IONQ because it has the potential to generate a life changing wealth, but if I lose it all I am okay with it, and as such I'd rather raise cash from a low growth holding (DELL) and from LVMH that might still grow but I am okay with the profit that I made so far.\n\nI am looking at the evolution of the Semiconductors, hence why I am not touching SMH. I think that the sector has more room to run in 2025, but it will be the next one to liquidate and move to my two long term holdings.\n\nThanks!\n\nP.S. let's take it for granted that I am an Internet person and by definition I am a liar and none of the above is true when it comes to gains etc.",

This approach is considered risky, but I have strong conviction in their relative valuation, defensibility, and long-term prospects.\n\nIn this case I believe that 'diversification' among AI stocks would do more to dilute my returns than mitigate my risks. Particularly because they're all highly correlated and despite its market cap, Nvidia has the most reasonable valuation all things considered. We'll see if the bet pays off.\n\nTo clarify, I am confident in the long-term prospects of Palantir, Tesla, and others, but I'm just not comfortable with the valuations. I may reassess in the future when I have new information or valuations change.\n\nMeta is the only other stock I held onto, given my bullish view on their AI and hardware strategy combined with their attractive valuation.\n\n# Unrealized (current investments)\n\n* **Meta (META):**\u00a0\\+367.97%\n* **Nvidia (NVDA):**\u00a0\\+117.05%\n\nNvidia's performance here is understated since I recently increased my holdings, but it's up \\~200% since I initially purchased it last year after\u00a0dithering for months.\n\nThese returns are less impactful without the values or relative weights, but I\u2019d like to maintain some anonymity around it.\n\n# Rate of return (IRR)\n\nMy annual return (IRR) for this portfolio (Jun 2022 to Dec 2024) is\u00a0**73.6%**.\n\n# Investment thesis\n\nSee a summary of my investment thesis in a\u00a0[previous update](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/17mzc07/15_year_followup_on_buying_the_dip_on_pandemic/).\u00a0**TL;DR:**\n\n>\u201c\u2026AI is another secular trend like PCs (Windows, Mac), the internet (browsers, search, social) and mobile (iOS, Android, wearables). The difference is that new technology like AI can now spread faster than ever before and get used in new ways. Every new epoch uniquely benefits from the past, potentially bending the growth curve in new ways.\n\n>The other difference is that Nvidia has a monopoly position on the core technology driving this innovation. Therefore, the \\~350% run up over the last 12 months doesn\u2019t make NVIDIA the stock of the last year, but rather it\u2019s the stock of the next decade. The recent 3X gain will be a blip compared to what\u2019s coming thanks to NVIDIA\u2019s CUDA (moat), among\u00a0[other things](https://stratechery.com/2023/nvidia-on-the-mountaintop/).\u201d\n\n>\\- [1.5 year follow-up on buying the dip on pandemic stocks](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/17mzc07/15_year_followup_on_buying_the_dip_on_pandemic/), Nov. 2023\n\n# Nvidia's dominance\n\nI'm still working through my thoughts here, but my strong conviction around Nvidia comes in part from these observations:\n\n* Nvidia is\u00a0[founder-led](https://www.amazon.com/Nvidia-Way-Jensen-Huang-Making/dp/1324086718/)\u00a0and focuses on accelerated computing while remaining broad enough to allow for innovation and insight across industries where it can apply its core competencies.\n* It's unprecedented to have such dominance in such a fast-growing, valuable industry while maintaining such a long-term sustainable advantage.\n* This advantage is due to unreasonable investments (research, hardware, software, ecosystem, relationships) over decades, making it hard to copy.\n* AI will consistently make software\u00a0easier to create, thus reducing the moats of software companies and make them less attractive than hardware companies (for now).\n* Despite their impressive growth, Nvidia is still supply constrained, which is fundamentally easier to predict than demand constraints.\n\n# We still underestimate the AI opportunity\n\nMost importantly, we\u2019ve barely scratched the surface of AI\u2019s opportunities and benefits. Even the most ambitious targets underestimate it because the better and cheaper AI gets, the more use cases we'll find.\n\nWe have a habit of confusing the limits of our imagination with the limits of reality. Our imaginations are trained on what happened before, but there has never been anything like this before.\n\n# Final thoughts\n\nI'm still well within the '*maybe I'm just lucky*' phase since it's only been a couple years. Towards the end of [my last update](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1d758m7/2_year_followup_on_buying_the_dip_on_pandemic/)\u00a0I also shared a few ways my investment approach has changed, which I\u2019m still benefiting from.\n\nI expect my next update to be the 3-year update in mid 2025.\n\n**UPDATE:** Thanks for mentioning I should have included indexes for benchmark context. Indexes like QQQ and S&P 500 also had good returns during the same period (June 2022 - Dec 2024). For an apples to apples comparison, the IRR of QQQ and S&P 500 respectively during this period were \\~24% and \\~16%.",

And with NVDA's revenue and profits not just increasing but multiplying in such a short timespan, investors want to know is it still a good time to buy, to catch the AI wave, as it builds and crashes upon the world, both that of capital investment and the greater world at large. \n\nRevenue and profits multiplying:\nhttps://imgur.com/oOetNo4\nhttps://imgur.com/caOkRlh\n\nAnd here\u2019s the chart that shows the impact of ChatGPT on the share price and earnings:\n\nhttps://imgur.com/SxhIF9z\n\nThe top line is the price investors are paying. \n\nThe bottom line is what those investors are getting, so to speak (NVDA\u2019s net income over the previous year (trailing twelve months)) \n\nThe vertical line roughly represents ChatGPT hitting 100m users with the line at 2023 January 1st and ChatGPT reportedely hitting 100m users sometime in that month of January according to Reuters and The Guardian.\n\nReuters:\nhttps://www.reuters.com/technology/chatgpt-sets-record-fastest-growing-user-base-analyst-note-2023-02-01/\n\nThe Guardian:\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/feb/02/chatgpt-100-million-users-open-ai-fastest-growing-app\n\nThe firm will present you with the basic facts about NVDA, not as, and never as, a financial recommendation, but as an introduction to its financials, to give you a better idea if it's even worth your time to further explore NVDA as a company and potential vehicle of investment. The firm does not want you to be falsely misled into thinking we can offer you expertise on NVDA, we cannot. We can however answer the questions that we would expect any man who'd risk his capital to answer. How much money does NVDA make? How much do they have? And you would think, most importantly, how much has NVDA paid their previous investors so far? And while we don't believe the answers to these questions to justify investment, this firm adamantly believes that not knowing the answers to these questions is unacceptable for those who do or would choose to buy common stock in NVDA. \n\nIn short, you'd have to be a fucking idiot to lend your money to a company without reading our charts and commentary, or the equivalent there of. To assess the full risk of NVDA however, will require a much deeper dive than a single blog post can provide.\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at what investors were thinking during the ChatGPT hype and whether that investment panned out at a fundamental rather than speculative level. In other words, did NVDA actually make more money or did its share price just go up?\n\nhttps://imgur.com/wRnNWlD\n\nThis graph shows what percentage of NVDA\u2019s share price was being represented by the money it had made (ttm net income/shares/share price). This 10 year low during 2023, shows unequivically that there was in fact investment hype during this time, that the price per earnings went very high as people were willing to accept less than 1% earnings just to get in on the hype. Why would investors accept such low earnings per dollar? Because these investors anticipated that the rapid adoption of ChatGPT and the AI hype around it, would mean a growth for NVDA that would more than make up for the price they paid. So were they dumb? Did they overpay? Let\u2019s find out! \n\nFor our example, we\u2019ll imagine an investor that bought sometime in February after the 100m user threshold was announced:\n\nFebruary 15th, 2023\n  $22.75 price\n  $0.175 net income\n  $0.175/$22.75 = ~0.8% \n\n\nDecember 10th, 2024\n  ~$2.57 net income\n  $2.57/$22.17 = ~11% \n\n\nIf an investor had bought sometime in February after the news of the 100m users was released. Let\u2019s say for example February 15th at a closing price of approximately $22.75 per share they would have bought when NVDA\u2019s trailing twelve month net income was about $0.175 (17.5 cents) per share, or about 0.8% of the price of the share at that time. Today, those same shares carry about $2.57 per share, a wopping 10x increase (almost 15 actually) in just 2 years. $2.57/$22.75 = ~11%, which means investors that bought in on the AI hype are already seeing the net income of their shares exceed the growth rate of the money supply (M2), which is about 7-8%. Meaning that NVDA isn\u2019t just earning more dollars, its earning a greater share of the economic pie, and in a world where profits are actually returned to investors, would mean beating inflation (at least from a micro perspective). Now whether this cash that NVDA is reporting to generate will ever actually make it back to the shareholder is another story.\n\nNow that we\u2019ve seen that buying (even when the fundamental value of the shares was at its lowest) has paid off, let\u2019s take a look at how much money NVDA actually has:\n\nhttps://imgur.com/VSPPMhj\nhttps://imgur.com/6KPxWte\n\nAs you can see, NVDA has almost no money relative to its price. The market\u2019s pricing of NVDA is derived principally from the money it is supposed to make in the future, rather than the present value of the company.\n\nThis is not what the firm would deem a good fundamental investment. Why? Because one would be paying a future price for future value, rather than the current price for its current value. Furthermore, the market is a game of desperation, and if shareholders are desperate for money, they should be offering their shares below the liquidation value of the company. A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush after all. \n\nHowever, if one understands that NVDA\u2019s price has been based on the growth of its earnings, and if one can also see that the growth of said earnings has gone up, but its stock price has gone down (as is the case for NVDA at the time of this post ~$135) then one could speculate that the market will not only price NVDA\u2019s earnings higher than they are currently being priced, but that the market will actually price its earnings higher than in the previous quarters unless the market believes that NVDA\u2019s future growth will be lower. The firm believes that within the next 3 months, NVDA will almost certainly attain new all time highs. In fact, we believe the passive participant in the market, will be genuinely surprised by how high the price of NVDA will go. At the time of this post, the firm has no positions in NVDA. An associate of the firm has exposure to NVDA through long options on the SNP500. A position the firm feels is not worth mentioning as longing the SNP500 might as well be a long on inflation.\n\nSo NVDA has made all this money? How much of that money has been returned to shareholders? \nhttps://imgur.com/RANJVwo\n\nAs you can see by that line at the bottom, almost none. About half of the money has been spent on share buybacks and when the company\u2019s evaluation is 50x the money that it makes and 50x the money that it has, these buybacks only break even once the company has actually grown 50x (less so if you\u2019re only evaluating the company on past earnings and not the amount of money it actually has, in this case, you might only want a 5x to consider yourself breaking even) . I\u2019d much rather have my money now and use it to make more money, than wait around for NVDA to 50x. But NVDA doesnt give shareholders the option of how to spend their own money or how to evaluate the company. They don\u2019t give the money to the shareholder to decide whether they want to wait for a 50x gain on NVDA. They\u2019ve decided they\u2019ll spend it for you. Not on growing the company or acquiring others, but by buying their own stock. \n\nNow that we can understand a basic view of NVDA\u2019s finances and how it relates to its price, let\u2019s take a glance at some of the more sinister aspects of NVDA.\n\nFirst is this little tidbit the firm discovered while reading NVDA\u2019s Q2 filing:\nhttps://imgur.com/b438cbJ\n\nNVDA expects you to follow **ALL**  6 of its listed social media accounts and will be leaving out material information in its 10Q and 10k filings that will only be available in its listed social media accounts. This is clearly unethical, and our firm at this time questions whether this intent to distribute exclusive material information across 6 different channels is even legal. Though we do not have the legal training or background to make a claim one way or the other, we would like to assume that the system in place would not allow such a thing.\n\nNow lets throw a bone to the hardware guys. If you\u2019ve never heard of Moore\u2019s Law, you can skip this section as trying to understand what Moore\u2019s Law means will get in the way of seeing the blatant contradiction between NVDA\u2019s CEO and his company\u2019s own SEC filings. For your time:\n\n   Moore's Law is the observation that the  number of transistors in an integrated circuit doubles about every two years.\n\n   The observation is named after Gordon Moore, the co-founder of Fairchild Semiconductor and Intel\n\n   From Wikipedia: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore's_law\n\n\nSo why is the firm bringing up Moore\u2019s Law? We don\u2019t even know what half that sentence means, and we certainly wouldnt be able to explain the nuances of NVDA\u2019s hardware products. Well, there\u2019s one thing we do know, it\u2019s how to bullshit. So let\u2019s wind back the clocks to the end of 2022. September. Right before entering Q4.\n\n\u201cMoore\u2019s Law\u2019s dead,\u201d Huang said, \u201cAnd the ability for Moore\u2019s Law to deliver twice the performance at the same cost, or at the same performance, half the cost, every year and a half, is over. It\u2019s completely over, and so the idea that a chip is going to go down in cost over time, unfortunately, is a story of the past.\u201d\n\nSource: https://www.marketwatch.com/story/moores-laws-dead-nvidia-ceo-jensen-says-in-justifying-gaming-card-price-hike-11663798618\n\n\n\nOk, so going into Q4, Moore\u2019s Law is dead. The CEO said it\u2019s over baby. Rapid growth is a thing of the past. That means the market should be lowering its growth expectations for NVDA right?\n\nhttps://imgur.com/VSPPMhj\nhttps://imgur.com/6KPxWte\n\nBut it did the opposite. Investors were willing to pay more for less, implying they actually expected NVDA\u2019s long term growth rate to increase not decrease. Almost as if the market knew what NVDA would end up publishing in its Q4 filing:\n\nSource: https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001045810/000104581023000017/nvda-20230129.htm\n\n(10k filed Feb 24, 2023)\n\nSo not only did the company contradict the CEO\u2019s statements made in the September prior to the reported quarter, now theyre actually ahead of Moore\u2019s law, and according to them, giving the entire industry a path forward. What the fuck. \ud83e\udd23\n\nAnd to finish things off, we\u2019ll put on our tin foil hats. The firm does not know how to verify the veracity of the following information. \n\nThere has been a short report put out by Hindenburg Research regarding SMCI:\n\n    https://hindenburgresearch.com/smci/\n\n\n\nThe firm has no idea if the information reported is true. So this last section is just for fun. If the information in the report is true, then the firm would conclude that it paints the picture that SMCI has been funneling money out of the company into other companies, out of shareholder hands, into the hands of insiders and their network of family and friends. SMCI\u2019s biggest customer? NVDA. In other words, if the allegations are accurate, the biggest chunk of money that SMCI funneled out came from NVDA. So it\u2019s really not outside the realm of possibility that NVDA was intentionally buying from SMCI knowing where the money was ending up. The firm is not in the practice of lawsuits or building criminal cases. So the firm cannot and has no intention of doing so here for you now. The firm, however, is also not stupid. And the fact that all this money the company is making is not ending up in shareholders pockets, really isnt helping the \u201cmanagement would never steal from shareholders\u201d fantasy that many would like to be the truism that must be disproved with mountains of evidence. It should have to be proven that the money is being returned to investors, not the other way around. When the vast majority of the profits dont go to the investors, which we can see from the dividend chart, but get spent on buybacks at 50x multiples, well people start to listen when accusations start to be made about money being funneled into other companies.\n\nWe\u2019ve learned a lot. We\u2019ve seen the impressive growth of NVDA\u2019s earnings and how they relate to its price and the general hype around AI. We\u2019ve shown that the company has barely any money at all and is being priced on future earnings. We\u2019ve shown where some of this money is going. And we even got to put on our conspiracy hats for a little bit. \n\nAnd that is our fundamental analysis of NVDA, the AI giant. The good, the bad, and the fugly. Thanks for tuning in. \n\n\n\n",

    "title": "Investment Advice- Rebalancing?",
    "selftext": "I am looking for some advice on my current portfolio and savings plan.\n\nI'm a fairly recent immigrant to this country (36m) so started my retirement/ savings from scratch in my early 30's. Currently live in a very HCOL city on the west coast, making around 100-150k/ year running my own business as an S corp, where I pay myself a W2 salary thats roughly 60% of my income, which i adjust regularly to stay ahead of taxes. The nature of my work is project based and freelance so every month is different. This year I am paying myself approx 6k gross per month on w2. The remainder of the income from the business and other 1099 income I usually manage to write off completely as I invest it back into the business.\n\nMy main expense is rent and utilities, other than that I have no other debt (paid off car, no student debt) aside from small credit card bills (under 3k that I pay off monthly- no interest)\n\n  \n**Current Accounts and Savings:**\n\n  \nPersonal Checking Account- $3k, keep this empty for monthly expenses only. Zero interest. I view this as a pass through account- salary in, bills out.\n\nBusiness Checking Account- $20k, this account fluctuates a lot depending on cash flow, I usually try to keep it around $20k- thinking I could/ should move at least 50% into an account that accrues some interest. \n\nSEP IRA (Deductible)- 25k, I max out the contribution yearly, 25% of my w2 income (started this in 2022) I divide that total amount by 12 and make 12 monthly DCA buys into VTI. That's it. Could possibly just start dropping a lump sum?\n\nROTH IRA- 18k, Maxing this out every year. $500 monthly DCA buys into VTI (50%) VOO (40%) and 10% cash.\n\nM1 Investment Account- $3k, started this is March of this year to start putting some money into some individual stocks and slightly more speculative plays. $100 weekly DCA buys into a basket of stocks MSTR, TSLA, NVDA, AMZN, AAPL, V, LLY  etc. I like to own individual names and regular DCA just keeps the guesswork out.\n\nRegular Brokerage Account- $1.5k, use this for the occasional weekly/ monthly option contract. Any gains over 1.5k just get emptied into the ROTH. I regularly generate 400-500 per month from this account, so most months i don't even need to fund my ROTH from my personal account.\n\nChase Investment Account- $14k, $400 monthly contribtions, this was a Chase Auto Invest account (mid risk) that yielded about 10%, so below avg market returns. Chase has ended this auto investment service so the money is 80% invested into various funds but the new contributions will just be cash unless i Manually buy new funds. As this has been underperforming the market, i'm thinking about splitting this up over a few of my other accounts to streamline.\n\n  \nCrypto- $20k, been buying $100 of BTC weekly for years. Occasionally add bigger lumps on big dips. Will continue this DCA strategy.\n\n  \nSo my currently contributions to all my accounts are :\n\n  \nSEP IRA- 1k monthly DCA into VTI  \nROTH IRA- $500 monthly DCA into VTI/ VOO  \nM1- $400 monthly DCA into various QQQ type stocks  \nChase Invest- $400 monthly DCA into money market  \nCrypto- $400 DCA into BTC  \n\n\nI don't really ever sell stocks or funds, unless they become seriously overweight, or I need the cash, which hasn't happened so far.\n\nI'm fairly happy with the amount that I am able to save and invest monthly, just wondering if anyone had advice on how I could streamline this approach, or if there are other account types or assets I should consider. The monthly DCA strategy just works for me because it means I really don't worry too much about market movements, I actually prefer to see prices go down so i can buy more cheaper. \n\nTLDR: Please critique my current investment strategy, are there any other account types i should be contributing to regularly to build wealth for the future and how could i manage my regular buys/ DCA/ contributions more effectively?",

    "selftext": "Last Saturday, Fox prints this piece.  [https://www.foxnews.com/world/us-scrambles-drones-shape-landscape-war-future-here](https://www.foxnews.com/world/us-scrambles-drones-shape-landscape-war-future-here)\n\nThen on Sunday, Elon tweets this [https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1860574377013838033](https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1860574377013838033)\n\nThen on Wednesday, it is announced that Don Jr joins the board of UMAC here [https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/27/unusual-machines-shares-soar-donald-trump-jr-joins-advisory-board.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/27/unusual-machines-shares-soar-donald-trump-jr-joins-advisory-board.html)\n\nSo what the hell is UMAC (Unusual Machines).  It is an absolutely tiny non-factor of a consumer drone maker located in a warehouse in Orlando.  Prior to the election, it had a flatlining stock trading around $1.50 and a market cap around $12M.  Then post election, the stock began rising suddenly with a number of large insider purchases.  Then with the announcement of Don Jr, the stock has soared to near $20 and a market cap of around $150M.  What's the hidden agenda.\n\nWell, Don Jr. is a smart (i.e. opportunistic) man.  The war in Ukraine has shown the world that land wars are obsolete.  Your $10M Abrams tank can be neutralized by a single drone and a grenade that costs less than $500.  Infantrymen are obsolete.  They can be hunted mercilessly 24 hours a day by drones, day and night, rain or shine, in the trenches, in holes and tunnels, around corners, remotely using thermal vision.\n\nDrones can only be defended by physical means (basically AI controlled counter-drones and bulelts).  Electronic jamming can be effectively countered with electronic shielding.  See this excellent video by Mark Rober.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrGENEXocJU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrGENEXocJU)\n\nDrones are the future of warfare.  We will not need people.  We will not need bombers.  We just need someone with a suitcase of drones able to infiltrate within a few miles of a desired target, release a couple drones with explosives, and the target is wiped out.  No need to send in a $2B B-2 bomber equipped with a $250M worth of bombs to take out the target.  $20,000 of drones in a suitcase will suffice.  Imagine also if that suitcase can lay their dormant and be opened remotely as needed to strike any target in the area.\n\nDrone warfare and terrorist strikes are coming to a place near you.  Sadly.\n\nLastly, the US DoD spends nearly $2T a year ($1.99T to be more exact).  This is clearly a level which is unsustainable, especially with the rising cost of debt service (yes, the Fed will need to engage in QE3 or 4 or 5 to prevent federal insolvency).  Spending cuts will need to happen.  And DoD with its bloated, irrational spending will be the primary targets.  It has to be.\n\nYou see, the Trump administration is dismantling the entire NeoCon apparatus.  Elon and Vivek, along with JD and Hegseth (maybe) and Tulsi and RFK2 (the Trump Avengers) are all zealots of the anti-establishment, anti-neocon, anti-war agenda.  I will bet you a nickle that they will chop trillions (as Vivek targeted $2T) in federal spending, starting with Elon's target the F-35.  Military strategy will evolve from enormously expensive concentrated single pieces of power (F-35, aircraft carriers, B-2, Abrams) to inexpensive fleets of cheap drones a la the Nova Corp.  [https://marvelcinematicuniverse.fandom.com/wiki/Nova\\_Corps?file=NovaCorpsInBattle.png](https://marvelcinematicuniverse.fandom.com/wiki/Nova_Corps?file=NovaCorpsInBattle.png)\n\nThese drones are nearly indefensible.  And they will be controlled by AI (buy NVDA).  This is the future of war.  And probably the doom of civilization.  It will not be AI that kills us off.  We won't make it that far.  Rather, we will kill ourselves off using AI-controlled drones to fight our wars.  The country with the smartest, fastest, and most drones wins.  We can strike every nuke silo simultaneously and defend our cities and facilities with a dome of drones.  The US not only has to defend its soil, but also that of its allies across the world.  It is hard to imagine how many drones the US military will need.  But lets try.\n\nIt is estimated that Ukraine is using 10,000 drones a month.  That is 300 a day.  This just on a small battlefield (only a 600 mile front-line!), capacity constrained military, using Generation 1 human-operated drone tactics.  Imagine having to defends tens of thousand critical facilities across the world at all times from a terrorist attack.  Imagine having to be prepared to fight a Drone World War all run by AI.  These systems would be able to control thousands of drones at a time.  We are talking many millions of drones for basic readiness (all operated by NVDA-driven AI).\n\nSo lets say the US military will prepare to fight a war globally on a front that is 100X the 600-mile front in Ukraine.  This may be low given the literally thousands of targets it will need to defend.  The battlefield is not contiguous.  And lets say AI war will use 50X (definitely low) the drones of human-operated war.  This is a 50M standing-army of drones required for defense (10,000 x 100 x 50).  That is for just 1 month of war.  Let's say the US military needs an 18-month stockpile.  That is 900M drones, lets call it 1B to simplify the math.  At say $200 per drone, that will cost $200B (about the cost of 2.5 F-35s to put that in perspective).\n\nLets say there is an attrition rate of 20% per year due to training and replacement (5-year life expectancy).  That is 250M replacement drones needed per year.  That is $50B for replacement drones.\n\nThis is SIGNIFICANTLY cheaper than developing and maintaining high-tech weapon systems and soldiers.  The savings you can achieve by reducing the number of infantry and high tech jets and ships and tanks, replacing them with drones are massive.  Enough to bail out the US federal debt!  Sure this change won't happen overnight, but it is happenings as we speak thanks to Ukraine.\n\nSo what does this all have to do with UMAC?  Well, it is perfectly positioned to ride the wave of this coming military revolution.  It has the anti-neocon son of the future president on its advisory board and from what I can tell, he is also a very significant shareholder in the company.  There is no way this deal was just put together in the past few weeks.  It had to be in the works for months subject to Trump winning the election.  Which then triggered new stock issuance by UMAC, DonJr's investment, and his ascension to the board.\n\nThe CEO of UMAC is a guy named Allan Evans.  You can hear him here back in July 2024 talking about focusing on military contracts and the need for NDAA-complaint manufacturers.  They are focusing on being an NDAA-compliant parts supplier to the drone market.  These guys know they can't make the sophisticated AI drones that the military will need.  But they sure as hell can supply the drone parts.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAQjqQyyCzQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAQjqQyyCzQ)\n\nAt a $150M market cap, this thing is ridiculously underpriced relative to where it should be after proper hyping.  I think the market is still trying to figure it out.  You can't value it on current fundamentals.  It is just the shell company for DonJr (and thereby Trump) to profit off the coming drone military revolution.  Just like Truth Social was/is for DonSr.  The future of drone warfare has arrived.  UMAC is positioned as the domestic NDAA-compliant part supplier.  With DonJr, it is the supplier of choice.  I don't know if there is another NDAA-compliant drone parts supplier out there (probably not given that it's mostly all been made thus far in China), UMAC has the pole position with DonJr as the driver.  It just takes a few introductions and investment dollars in manufacturing capabilities (Elon can help with that) for UMAC to be awarded (directly or indirectly) purchase orders.  If you are a defense contractor hoping to win a bid, would you not include as part of your proposal some business directed to UMAC?\n\nIf even 5% of military drone spending makes it through to UMAC, that is $10B in revenue to build the standing army, and $2.5B a year ongoing.  Assuming a 10% net margin, that is $1B in profits on the stockpiling and $250M a year for replacements.  And if there is a US-supplied war somewhere, then it would be even higher.  Ignoring stockpiling revenues and valuing it only on the replacement revenue, at a reasonable 20X PE ratio, this is a $5B market cap company.  That is 33X from current levels.  If they are targeted to achieve that in 10 years, then that implies a current FMV of $1.2B which is 8X from the current $150M market cap or about a $160 stock price.\n\nThink $1.2B is an absurd hype valuation?  Let me introduce you to the psychedelic and weed stocks of a few years ago.  And also the countless biotech stocks that may someday enter into a Phase 1 trial.  And with those stocks, you could not build a case for their valuations.  It was just hype and blind-buying.  UMAC actually has a story and a path towards much bigger things.  And someone named Trump.",

Biggest paper gain so far from my current holding is from AAPL, NVDA, PLTR, CRWD and RKLB. 75% paper gain obviously is pretty good to me and it\u2019s at all time high. Lately super green market is partly due to the favorable result of election, slightly better than expected market condition and expectation of soft landing. But Correction is imminent, mid-December or bull market keeps going until February or late March when big player adjusts their portfolio? Things can\u2019t go up forever. Wondering if I should cash out everything and buy back in after correction. Any insight is appreciated ",

    "selftext": "I've been thinking about the philosophy of rebalancing. The purpose of rebalancing your portfolio (just buy all stocks bro, excluded) is to maintain a risk profile that's consistent with your goals. \n\nSo say if NVDA went up by 300% and INTC got halved and now NVDA is 80% of your portfolio. The philosophy of rebalancing would demand you to sell a large portion of NVDA and invest in INTC. \n\nThat strategy if we look at the chart, doesn't work so well for your wallet. \n\nSo here's me wondering if rebalancing on the surface is \"buy low sell high\" when in reality it's just \"sell your winners and buy more losers\". \n\nOn the converse with an outsized NVDA position you just increased your risk on one company big time so if NVDA gets hit by say an antitrust or Jensen's brain scan AI go Skynet, you're gonna get decimated. \n\nThere's a lot of moving gears in this decision.

    "selftext": "hey all, sharing what i'm calling my \"frontier tech\" portfolio, broken down by percentages. i'm looking for valuable input, feedback, and discussion around it. and, if it happens to be helpful to anyone, even better. i do want to clarify a few things:\n\n* i'm focused on AI, bitcoin, and space. investment vehicles or not, i simply think each are tech frontiers that hold tons of promise, are poised for massive growth, and will bring immense amounts of value to the world over the next few decades. let's just call this a \"frontier tech\" portfolio, to give it a name i can reference.\n* i'm not looking for feedback that just disagrees with that thesis. whether you think AI is all hype, or you are anti-Bitcoin and think it's a ponzi scheme, or you think space is a waste of resources, or anything along these lines - that's ok, i respect that perspective, but i'd like to avoid arguing about it. we just disagree about some fundamental things, and you won't convince me i'm simply wrong.\n* i AM looking for feedback on blind spots, poor/missing assumptions, overconfidence, things i'm not considering, or any other constructive input that falls within the framework of the overall thesis. i'm not just looking for people to agree with me (though that is interesting input as well) - i just want feedback that can be applied within my overall investing philosophy.\n* yes, i'm missing some key areas of what many would call \"frontier tech\" - biotech, green / nuclear energy, cybersecurity, to name a few - but i just don't have the same level of confidence in specific areas of those. i prefer to stay relatively focused on the categories where i'm most confident and able to stay up to date.\n* i'm trying to keep my language somewhat appealing to a wide audience. not looking to get too bogged down in technical details or language that would alienate someone reading this stuff who's less familiar with one or any of the spaces/categories.\n* my primary goal is a portfolio of funds and stocks that i can invest in with *strong long-term confidence in growth.* not stuff i trade frequently. and not stuff i love the idea of or that seems interesting / sexy but that i don't know enough about (SMCI, PLTR, altcoins as some good examples). i also generally prefer companies whose leadership i trust and/or admire.\n\nok, with that out of the way, let's dive in:\n\n**30% AI** - 10% NVDA, 5% SOXQ, 15% balanced mixed of NOW, MSFT, AAPL, GOOGL, META, AMZN\n\n* HIGH LEVEL: to me, this category is ABSOLUTELY going to change our world in fundamental ways over the next several decades. AI's potential is not chatGPT, or smarter versions of it. it's far beyond what we're seeing from LLMs today. if you listen to the engineers and operational leaders within the AI space, listen to not what they \"believe\" is gonna happen, but to what they know is coming because they've already used the tech, usually 1-2 years before the public even sees it, these people are overwhelmed, amazed, terrified, enchanted, bewildered. to me, that's just very interesting. i believe what some others do - that we're in the midst or on the verge of another technological revolution. i'm not bothered much that AI isn't monetizing in demonstrable, repeatable ways. i think there's been and continues to be enough fundamental, increasing advancement in this field that the value creation will absolutely surpass what most people think. as for the individual stocks, i'll do a quick dive here. to be clear, I don't think these are groundbreaking choices and many are very obvious. but, seems useful to give my favorite things about each:\n* 10% NVDA - these guys are and will continue to be at the center of the whole thing. their moat is extensive. it's not just GPU / blackwell demand. it's their CUDA programming language and universe, and stickiness of it. it's the long-term horizon required for their data centers that makes 5-10 year customers out of everyone who buys their stuff. it's CEO jensen pushing them and already looking for the \"next big thing.\" just a lot of confidence here.\n* 5% SOXQ - i like this semiconductor ETF a little more than SMH because it's more diverse (SMH is like 25% NVDA, which is great if i didn't already allocate so much there), and it's got a low expense ratio (0.19%). i love this exposure because the AI industry is driven by these companies (e.g. TSMC, Micron, Broadcam, Qualcomm, AMD, AMAT).\n* 15% mix of these...\n   * NOW - excellent leadership and integrated heavily with NVDA tech; will benefit hugely from AI boom with AI-driven automation\n   * META - founder-run and with a clear vision; demonstrating enormous resources and focus on building AI models, meeting consumer needs, being pioneers in tech at large\n   * AAPL - will probably benefit the most from consumer-facing AI products and implementation; strong leadership\n   * AMZN - AWS is a profit monster that will be huge for AI tools and services and data centers; logistics and ecom will be big AI beneficiaries; strong leadership\n   * MSFT - deeply embedded in the AI revolution with its investment in OpenAI + AI integration into Azure and Microsoft 365; excellent leadership\n   * GOOGL - AI pioneer with DeepMind / Brain; they still own search; have enormous amount of data; questionable leadership but I'm holding for now\n* No TSLA??? no. i just don't trust elon musk enough at this point. and i need confidence in a company's leadership for me to invest in its stock. there's a big chance i'm missing out (their robotics division might be incredible), but I'm able to sleep OK with that.\n* i'm also missing plenty of other AI picks. i know that. these are the ones i can invest in with the most confidence.\n\n**30% Bitcoin** - 25% Bitcoin itself (cold storage or an ETF), 5% MSTR\n\n* HIGH LEVEL: why Bitcoin? books have been written about it, but to shortly summarize my perspective - it's quite volatile and risky short-term, and quite growth-oriented and (thus far) safe long-term. excellent store of value. wonderful technology, math/code based, and may or may not upend some portion of the financial system. limited supply that's only decreasing over time. immutable. now adopted by many big institutions. goes on giant bull runs every 4 or so years. some days, it's hard to justify NOT putting more into this one, but for now i'm convinced that\u00a0 diversification is the better long-term play.\n* 20% Bitcoin - many would argue that holding actual Bitcoin, ideally off exchanges and on cold storage is the smartest play here. but there are also arguments for FBTC or IBIT (helpful in tax-advantaged accounts; trusting an ETF seems safer to some - very debatable). i do some cold storage, and some FBTC (they self-custody their Bitcoin, which not everyone does). either way, just Bitcoin. it's the only crypto play where my confidence level is very high.\n* 5% MSTR - this is a leveraged Bitcoin play. strong chance it outpaces BTC growth rate during bull runs. i may shift some MSTR profits to Bitcoin over time if it starts to really offset my 4:1 BTC:MSTR ratio.\n\n**30% Space** - 10% ASTS, 10% RKLB, 5% LUNR\n\n* HIGH LEVEL: the tech for space finally seems to match the potential that's been talked about for decades and decades. for a while, space-x really proved this out, almost single-handedly. but we clearly have some strong other players either in or entering the category. my favorites are these three. here's why:\n* 10% ASTS - you should read the kook report (google it) for a true deep dive, but to hit my high level points: they are pre-revenue but with the potential for MASSIVE growth. effectively, their satellite system aims to offer a global cellular network. think starlink but more b2b and generally better tech. they own tons of patents. they are 5+ years ahead of what many think will be a winner-takes-most race. their partners already include AT&T, Verizon, Vodafone, Rakuten, American Tower, Bell Canada, and more. they have excellent leadership. i find this a risky-ish play as they have tons to still accomplish, but the potential growth is enormous.\n* 10% RKLB - effectively, a space-x competitor on smaller rockets, with a fraction of the market cap and a huge runway for growth. i think still heavily undervalued today. nerdy/awesome leadership. vertically integrated. as telecom, defense, and general research spending expands to space economy, RKLB is positioned very, very well.\n* 5% LUNR - i've spent less time researching them than the other two, but my confidence level in the risk/reward is still pretty high. key player in the lunar economy - one of few companies that can deliver payloads to the moon. very niche but valuable moat. huge potential, good amount of risks ahead.\n\n**10% cash** - ...to buy them juicy dips.\n\nok, that's my \"frontier tech\" portfolio summary. to repeat - this is what i can confidently invest in for what i believe will be better-than-average returns over the next 10+ years. i recognize that this discussion didn't even really touch share price, EPS, P/E, profitability, revenue, or other key details. this just isn't the place where i'm getting into that. i can say that i'm comfortable with the financial metrics and details regarding these companies. but this discussion is mainly focused on what categories i think are poised for the most growth, and what companies/stocks/assets in those categories seem to be most positioned to lead that growth. thanks for reading.\n\n*\\*\\*\\*The information provided is for educational and informational purposes only and should not be considered financial advice.

    "selftext": "I am trying to level up my game, and for a pretty long time I just looked at the balance sheet, a few ratios, P/E, forward P/E, compared these to the industry average, healthy cash flow, debt etc. Most of the time I just did this on well known stocks, MSFT, AAPL, NVDA, INTC, AMD, META etc. basically companies you hear about a lot everywhere, I just had no trust in lesser known companies to outperform the market, even if these basic metrics were promising.\n\nNow it worked out relatively well since I started investing, but I feel like I didn't really beat the market by too much with my stock picks given the extra risk I took. There was a study by\u00a0[Cornell](https://www.cornell-capital.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/2024-Q2-Memo.pdf?_bhlid=91b22f94067500de4f838bfb72c6cdab059cf3dc), where one of the graphs show the % of SP500 stocks beating the SP500, and while the data doesn't go back too much -would love to see one that goes back until 1970-1980 at least-. however for the 2014-2023 period it can be seen that about 40-50% of the companies beat the 'market'. So basically if you stock pick with a random generator you have a good chance to have a similar performance to the market. So I believe with a proper educated research it would be possible to tip the scales in our favor.\n\nSo I feel like the way I picked stocks was sort of look at the most hyped and known companies, have a basic glance on some ratios and the balance sheet, and I feel like this is so bad that it will bite back after a while. I see quite a few people here on reddit and some other communities knowing so much about a company, the moat they have, why it's a good investment, why it would be a bad one etc. What is the proper approach to get information? What sources are valuable? I assume earning reports are one, but I doubt they have all the information of the industry the company is in, why it's better than competitors etc. surely there are some other sources that are used for all this.\n\nAny advice is appreciated!",

    "title": "Tax implications question regarding capitol losses/gains",
    "selftext": "My RSUs and ESPP shares will be forced to sell as my company is being acquired by another (new company is not public). The price it is being sold at will leave me with an overall capitol loss of \\~20K (most long-term with some short-term shares being sold). Since this is going to happen, I'm thinking of also selling most of my other shares in which I have made long-term capitol gains (NVDA +10K, GOOG +1K, AMZN +1K, etc) and then buying all these shares back since I would like to hold onto them longer. Therefore the \\~20K in losses that I'm forced to take is somewhat \"offset\" by selling shares I've earned gains from, wiping out my capitol gains tax and having a better tax situation. Then buy back the shares I've sold from NVDA, GOOG, AMZN, etc, and I no longer have to worry about a bigger tax bill on the capitol gains when I finally do decide to sell.\n\nI don't know much about the taxing on capitol losses/gains and buying back stocks you've recently sold for a profit. So am I missing something here, is it as simple as I have stated to avoid a much higher tax bill in the future by doing this or am I way off? Also, selling shares for a profit and then buying them back the next day to lower the taxes I would pay on capitol gains tax is allowed? Or is there some rule/law that says you can't do that? Sorry for the basic questions, but this is new to me. Thanks for any help, much appreciated!",

I have NVDA shares which have appreciated $40K, and I have held them for more than a year. Does it make sense to take my profit now in order to have a net-zero transaction?

    "selftext": "Specifically:\n\n* Long term SP500 PE and CAPE are about 17.  $17 bought you $1 of corporate earnings.\n\n* current SP500 PE is 27 (CAPE is 34).   Market is overpriced by 100% if you believe in CAPE.\n\n* current QQQ PE is 36.5, even pricier.\n\n* RSP (Invesco *Equal Weighted* SP500) has a fairly reasonable PE=21.   Essentially, it's no longer pulled up by huge contributions from NVDA, Apple, Alphabet, etc.   RSP hasn't grown much since the start of 2021.   \n\n* yet in the dividend/value department, SCHD has PE=15.22 (if you believe Yahoo finance).  VYM has PE=16.5.   VYMY has PE=9.6.   These are all 'fairly' priced by historical standards.\n\nI'm not sure I understand the low PE for SCHD and VYM on Yahoo finance, because a glance at the top-10 holdings of SCHD and VYM generally shows higher PE.  The top low PE components are oil majors.  But Schwab has a similar PE figure as Yahoo.    Maybe the low-PE stocks lurk in non-top holdings.\n\nSo, questions: \n\nIf I were go back 20 or 30 or 50 years, would value stocks also have been be trading at PEs much lower than the market as a whole?   So whatever the equivalent of SCHD was would be trading at PE=10, say?    Or would value stocks have been trading at PE=16, and the dominance of a handful very high PE, high market cap stocks is a modern anomaly?\n\nEqual-weight SP500 RSP always yielded less than SP500, but the  difference was [modest until 2019 or so](https://www.invesco.com/us-rest/contentdetail?contentId=e3fc7c23dbd92610VgnVCM1000006e36b50aRCRD&dnsName=us).   And in 2022 they almost re-converged, so SP500 took a hit but RSP held steady.    So it looks to me like the total domination of big tech is relatively recent.\n\nIs there a traditional stock market lurking inside the value segment, or even the equal weighted segment?    I mean a market where you pay for 1/PE expected real returns, rather than being driven up by a few unicorns.",

    "title": "Analyzing the Analysts: Using average analyst price target to identify possible buying opportunities amongst the top 100 companies in the S&P",
    "selftext": "Hello everyone,\n\nI'm a lazy investor and don't like to do much due diligence, but I do like to make money. Unfortunately these two things about me are often at odds as I've lost money in the past for not doing my DD. As such, I continue to be lazy but I try and find ways to work around doing due diligence and hopefully finding loop holes.\n\nOne such way that I have been thinking about recently is using analyst ratings, reviews and price targets as a surrogate for due diligence. In essence, I try to just have these analysts do the work for me. An idea I had is that much in the same way that with those who believe in technical analysis hold that everything you need to know about a stock is baked into it's price action, and so when something good happens the stock price goes up and when something bad happens the stock price goes down, thus all you need is to analyze trends in stock price and you'll be analyzing everything about the stock by proxy, I have a thesis (or theory) that perhaps you can do the same or something similar with analyst price targets of companies.\n\nNow I know that anyone who has read this far, already thinks I'm an idiot. Many experienced individual investors probably find market analysts to be stupid and therefor I'm stupid for following their lead, but I would argue to the contrary for a few reasons. As much as I have put in a lot of effort to learn about how the market operates (been investing for the last 6 years, started learning actively about it as much as I could a couple years prior to that), there is still much I don't know as I don't have a finance or economics degree. Moreover, as bad as you may think an analyst is, they are at least competent enough to keep their job as an analyst at the investment firm that allows them to make stock price target selections. Lastly, and most importantly, what I am about to discuss below uses the aggregate of several analyst price targets so I'm not relying on a single analyst but several (probably between 10 and 40 per company). I think if two-dozen analysts are strongly in favor of a company, it is unlikely that my novice investor wisdom would have researched the company and found a flaw that they all missed.\n\nSo what I did yesterday evening was go through the top 100 S&P 500 companies by market cap and find the current average price target for them on Yahoo Finance. I then divided the current stock price (at the close on 7/31) by that price target and expressed it as a percentage to see how far off the company was from the average price target analysts were aiming for. Then I also listed how many total ratings each company had, and how many of them were 'Strong Buys' and 'Buys'.\n\nThis yielded the following table:\n\n|+|A|B|C|D|E|F|G|H|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|1|Company|Current Price|Price Target|Percent to Target|Total Ratings|# Strong Buy Ratings|# Buy Ratings|% of Ratings that were Strong

(INTU)\n\nI have about $5,000 I'd like to invest right now and I have half a mind to just put it equally weighted into these 11 companies and just watch it for the next year or two. I'll either do that or put it all in VOO, but I have a feeling that these 11 companies might beat the S&P 500 over the next 24 months.\n\nWhat do you guys think?",

    "title": "I (like many others) am bullish on NVIDIA and have a risky strategy in mind involving borrowing on margin and I would like to know if it all makes sense the way I\u2019m picturing it in my head.",
    "selftext": "Basically my plan is to fund a margin account with shares of VOO that I already own with Fidelity. \n\nAfter transferring the shares of VOO from Fidelity into an Interactive Brokers (IBKR) margin account, I then want to buy shares of NVDY (NOT NVDA) with margin. I chose IBKR because they had the lowest margin interest rate I could find; 7.8% compared with 12.125% that I\u2019d get if I did this with Fidelity.\n\nFor those who may not be familiar with NVDY, it is a Yield Max fund that does not invest in Nvidia stock directly, but instead generates high yield income from a covered call strategy. The current dividend yield, based on the latest monthly dividend projected forward for 12 months, is 105% and their TTM dividend yield is 60%. [If you like, you can read more about NVDY and read the fund\u2019s Prospectus here on the YieldMax website](https://www.yieldmaxetfs.com/our-etfs/nvdy/)\n\nWith each dividend distribution received, I\u2019d like to buy more shares of NVDY to decrease my average cost-basis, especially on the day where the stock price drops equal to the dividend distribution. This will allow me to own more shares and collect larger dividends as time goes by.\n\nI am aware of the risk for NAV erosion, but given that I am long on NVIDIA and the stock price of NVDY seems to correlate with NVIDIA\u2019s stock price, I actually think that as time passes and NVIDIA\u2019s share price eventually increases over the coming several years, that the price of NVDY will remain relatively resilient. I don\u2019t need it to go up, I just need it not to go substantially down, but I think it actually may go up as well. I do not believe this to be the case for other YieldMax funds however.\n\nTo give you an idea, I would like to buy 2000 shares of NVDY which is currently trading at $28.60 (which would be $57.2k in total). The most recent dividend distribution which was announced on July 3rd was $2.47 per share. Had I owned these stocks then, I\u2019d have received $4940, on an investment that I purchased on margin and didn\u2019t even have to have the money myself. This comes out to roughly 8.6% yield each month. Obviously there is no guarantee that you would get this amount each month and it probably won\u2019t be the case, but I\u2019d settle for an average of half of that amount on average over the next several months until the election and end of 2024. Regardless of how much it ends up being, it will almost certainly more than cover the 7.8% margin interest that I would be charged annually. \n\nI would then use all or some of the nearly $5k dividend to purchase more shares of NVDY. The stock price would decrease from whatever it is on the declaration date (let\u2019s just assume it remains at $28.60; although I imagine that as we approach the declaration date that it will go up) by $2.47 and so I could therefore purchase up to 189 additional shares of NVDY at a presumed share price of $26.13.\n\nIn my opinion, it only makes sense to own shares of these super-high, income generating dividend yield ETFs when they are purchased on margin because the broker is the one paying the cost of the shares, but I am the one benefiting from what is essentially converting stock price growth into cash instead of value appreciation. The risk is of course that the stock price tanks, which I am willing to take as somebody very bullish on NVDA over the next 1-3 years.\n\nMy hope is that within one year, I will have collected enough dividend payments that I vastly out pace any depreciation in share price.\n\nI know this strategy carries large amounts of risk, but I would like to take a stab at it. \n\nI basically just one question to ask about this strategy as I have done a lot of reading about margin accounts, but am relatively new to actually trading on margin, which I\u2019ve avoided in the past, but I like the potential that it has with this strategy. You always gotta start somewhere haha.\n\n1. I am a little fuzzy having never traded any dividend stock on a margin account before. Does the cash I receive for the dividend payout go towards paying down the outstanding margin loan balance, or is it deposited as cash? I suppose it does not really make too much of a difference in the long run because if my margin loan were to decrease, my buying power would increase and my maintenance margin amount would decrease and if I so choose, I could buy more NVDY shares on margin and all things are essentially equal one way or another. (I know this does not take into account how much loss of equity I may have once the stock price drops after the dividend distribution. Any actual purchases I make would involve a thorough evaluation of what the current maintenance margin, SMA and Reg-T are).\n\nThat\u2019s basically my plan here. Again, I am well aware that it is risky, and as I am young-ish (early 30s), I am willing to take a big risk and see how it pans out. If I find that it\u2019s not working as I envisioned, I\u2019ll do what I always do and cut my losses, take an L, and try to make money elsewhere.\n\nI would not describe myself as a novice investor as I have been actively managing my Fidelity account for the last five years and have been doing a lot of research and learning as much as I can, whether it is through reading or (unfortunately) trial and error. I do not have a background in finance however, and so some of the nuances and technical jargon when it comes to margin accounts and options trading can get tricky to parse through, so I appreciate the help of this community.\n\nDo you guys see any glaring holes in this strategy? Aside from the fact that I am risking the stock price of NVDY decreasing?? If so, I\u2019d love to hear it!\n\nThanks in advance!",
