    "selftext": "If you\u2019ve seen my last couple posts I\u2019ve been pretty good at picking stocks near the bottom before a bull run. CRDO, NBIS, ENTG, GLXY and most recently MNDY which I did a DD on. The problem is I\u2019m a regard and mismanaged all of them for a loss except MNDY, but I\u2019m rolling those gains into what I present before you today: $TTD. \n\nTTD is an ad tech company that has received a series of aggressive prison beatings in the market on its way to becoming S&P 500\u2019s worst performing stock of 2025. They act as the Don Draper of advertising, so if you\u2019re a company that wants to advertise on platforms outside of the walled gardens you don\u2019t call each company individually you call TTD and they help you find the best spots for your money across the channels they have access to. Most of TTD\u2019s slide this year is in reaction to the walled gardens (GOOG, AMZN, META) getting bigger because TTD doesn\u2019t have access to youtube, prime video and ig.\n\n[Shanked by Google, jumped by Amazon, and left holding META's lunch tray. ](https://preview.redd.it/j4cdi2znn4qf1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=5a3a6bef7e1489a97126b63dca60e2c49fe2ff07)\n\nThey aren\u2019t taking this lying down, TTD bought back $647 mil between the first two quarters of 25 and have $375 mil left to use under that approval. Buybacks like this are bc the c suite is either putting their dicks on the table and saying \u201cwe\u2019re undervalued\u201d or they want to cook the books and boost eps. I don\u2019t care either way because I think they\u2019ll buoy the share price at the 52 wk low. The fed cuts also boost valuation models making future earnings look better for a growth stock like TTD. \n\nThe DOJ vs. Goog ad tech remedies case begins next week. Guilt for Goog has already been decided, this is now about how they will change their monopoly on digital advertising by controlling both the publisher and ad exchange. DOJ is pushing for a breakup of the stack, which would give TTD access to premium inventory and be a huge tailwind. Most of the c suite for TTD has testified at one point in this trial and the CEO said \u201cTTD managed to win in an unfair market, imagine what we could do in a fair market\u201d. Well I\u2019m putting my $$ on CEO Jeff Green\u2019s imaginings. \n\n[Got flamed last time for posting after my position was already up so this is hot off the press.](https://preview.redd.it/m6lu0fd3o4qf1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=7d54a33d6a6fbefca78b474a478c3e828bb6b776)\n\nFinal considerations are for their new AI tools and the possibility of M&A. Kokai and OpenPath will be fully launched by the end of this year, these are meaningful next gen innovations. Brands using Kokai so far have seen a 43% lower cost per household reach on ads and OpenPath has led to 39% bump in CTV revenue for clients like Vizio. If the remedies case forces Goog to make major changes, the rest of big tech could say fuck it and buy TTD given the current depressed valuation, giving better reach in the open internet and picking up a competitor. Big media like Disney or Roku could also integrate or partner to control supply path and reduce dependency, like what we just saw with Amazon and Netflix. \n\nAlso incredibly small flyer chance TikTok\u2019s walled garden is opened up in the US acquisition giving TTD further opportunity.",

The company said this will make it easier for customers to purchase cars from its fleet.\n\nStarting today, customers can search Amazon Autos to browse, finance, and purchase from thousands of used Hertz fleet vehicles from brands like Ford, Toyota, Chevrolet, Nissan, and others. Hertz Car Sales, the rental car firm's used car sales arm, will be the first fleet dealer on Amazon Autos.\n\n\"Our goal is to reimagine the car-buying experience and meet customers where they are \u2014 whether online or in person \u2014 with convenience, confidence and scale,\" Hertz Car Sales executive vice president Jeff Adams said in a statement. \"Amazon Autos is the ideal partner to help us deliver on this as customers can shop our expansive inventory of high-quality used cars on the same trusted marketplace where millions shop every day.\"\n\nHertz said sales will begin in the Dallas, Houston, Los Angeles, and Seattle metro areas, with plans to expand to Hertz Car Sales' 45 locations nationwide. After customers complete their purchase online, they can pick up the vehicles at Hertz locations in those cities.\n\n\"This collaboration allows us to offer an expanded selection of well-maintained vehicles from more dealerships across the country, while maintaining the simplicity that customers expect from Amazon,\u201d Global Head of Amazon Autos Fan Jin said in a statement.\n\nHertz will offer a 115-point inspection process and a 12-month/12,000-mile powertrain warranty. Hertz is also adding a seven-day/250-mile buyback guarantee and 24-hour roadside assistance.\n\nAmazon's addition of Hertz vehicles is another big move for its auto sales business. Late in 2024, Amazon\u00a0struck a deal with Hyundai\u00a0(005380.KS) to sell new vehicles in cities such as New York, Los Angeles, and Chicago, among others. Amazon users can buy and finance vehicles from local participating dealers directly on Amazon's website or app.\n\nAs for Hertz, the company is coming off something of a PR hit after its newly implemented AI scanning tool for returned vehicles\u00a0dinged renters with high fees, sometimes thousands of dollars, for damage that renters claim they did not incur.",

    "selftext": "**DD/TLDR Rocket Reason**\n\n1. NVIDIA and all big tech are customers\n2. 20% short interest - presumably because of financial reporting fears. SMCI went from 3 million shares short a quarter ago to 95 million shares short now (Fintel). I know finance and this is no longer a problem. SMCI clearly announced they Do Not Need to restate earnings and their auditors found no instances of fraud (given US laws, you don\u2019t casually declare this on an earnings call).\u00a0\n3. Meeting or even slightly beating earnings will squeeze the shorts\u2019 balls blue. OPEN had a short interest of 20.73%, look what happened when it squeezed.\n4. Massive expected INCREASE in AI spend. Ex: Recent Google earnings announced increase to $85 billion. X (Grok) working to launch millions of GPUs and shipping a \u201cpower plant\u201d from Europe to power it. Every AI player (MSFT, META, AMZN, Open AI etc) will do the same increasing spend to the 70-90bill range. TSMC also reported great earnings. Clear sign demand is accelerating not slowing.\n5. International expansion - SMCI won a Major Exclusive $20 billion DataVolt (Saudi Arabia) deal, Ericsson.\n6. Raised 2.3 billion cash and sold 1.79 billion in receivables for expansion. Big-brain move at 0% interest with capped calls. They are currently generating cash and not burning it, which means the money is primarily for planned massive growth and expansion.\n7. BofA Analist Ruplu Bhattacharya, has a $35 price target on SMCI, but had a price target of $1,090 at one point, which is a ridiculous joke. Big funds probably have major short positions and are now caught with their pants down and are using their Analist to beat prices down. They don\u2019t know computers. If SMCI reports spectacular earnings on 8/5/2025, and their tits get squeezed, she\u2019ll be relegated to OnlyFans.",

    "selftext": "Nvidia ([NVDA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NVDA)) has outperformed every stock in the S&P 500 ([\\^GSPC](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5EGSPC)) since\u00a0[the launch of ChatGPT\u00a0](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/how-chatgpt-changed-the-world-of-tech-in-just-one-year-180957543.html)in late November 2022 Shares in the chipmaker have risen nearly 700% since ChatGPT brought the power of artificial intelligence to the masses, far outpacing the S&P 500's roughly 45% over the same time period. The next closest gain for an S&P 500 company in that time period is a 540% pop for Vistra Corp ([VST](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/VST)).Nvidia has established itself as the key provider of chips needed to operate AI systems. Now at the epicenter of an AI arms race, Nvidia has established itself as[\u00a0a cornerstone of the recent bull market](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/live/stock-market-today-tech-leads-stocks-higher-as-nvidia-surges-to-record-high-175727614.html)\u00a0in stocks as the company's sales and profits have skyrocketed over the past several years.\n\nAhead of the\u00a0[company's next quarterly earnings release on May 28](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-to-report-q1-earnings-as-middle-east-deals-export-control-reprieve-boost-stock-122728218.html), we broke down some of the most eye-popping charts that show how Nvidia became one of the most-followed stocks in the market.There's perhaps no clearer way to see how Nvidia ran away from the competition in the AI boom than looking at the company's market capitalization against its peers. Back when ChatGPT launched, Nvidia had a market cap of just over $400 billion. It's now over $3.3 trillion. Over that same time period, chip competitor Intel's ([INTC](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/INTC)) market cap has actually decreased, while Advanced Micro Devices' ([AMD](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMD)) market cap has increased incrementally from $125 billion to $177 billion.Nvidia's rise proved to be at the center of a new technological boom. Combined with Nvidia, the rise in dominance of six other companies \u2014 Apple ([AAPL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL)), Alphabet ([GOOGL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOGL),\u00a0[GOOG](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOG)), Microsoft ([MSFT](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MSFT)), Amazon ([AMZN](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMZN)), Meta ([META](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/META)), and Tesla ([TSLA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA)) \u2014 formed what would come to be known as the\u00a0[\"Magnificent Seven.\"](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/one-chart-shows-how-the-magnificent-7-have-dominated-the-stock-market-in-2023-203250125.html)\n\nThe group began the AI boom with a combined market cap just shy of $7 billion. Now, two and a half years later, the Big Tech group's market cap is worth over $16.8 trillion. The seven companies have grown from about 22% of the S&P 500's market cap in November 2022 to 32% of the index's market cap today.Given the outsized weighting in the S&P 500, large swings in shares of Nvidia have become a feature of how even broad market investors are thinking about the direction of stocks. In June 2024,[\u00a0three Wall Street strategists boosted their year-end S&P 500 targets](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ai-enthusiasm-prompts-3-wall-street-banks-to-raise-stock-market-forecasts-100027154.html), citing better-than-expected consistent performance among key AI players.\n\nAs of May 19, the Magnificent Seven have accounted for about 52% of the S&P 500's gain since Nov. 30, 2022. Nvidia alone has contributed 17.21%, by far the most among the group, with the next closest stock, Microsoft, which has added about 8.8%.Nvidia's stock hasn't been rising from just hype. The company's quarterly financial metrics have soared. In the quarter ChatGPT launched, Nvidia posted revenue of $6.3 billion. Two years later, it would post revenue of $35.3 billion. That's a 460% increase in sales in two years. As seen in the chart below, the main source of growth for Nvidia has been its data center revenue segment, which includes the sales of its AI chips.\n\nFrom the company's fourth quarter of 2023 to its final quarter of its 2025 reporting period, data center revenue grew almost 900%.\n\nNvidia's data center revenue particularly stands out when considering its rise against peers in the industry. In the final quarter of 2024, Nvidia notched a record $35.58 billion in just data center revenue, up from $3.62 billion in the final quarter of 2022.\n\nIn comparison, Alphabet's data center revenue increased to $11.96 billion, ending 2024 up from $7.32 billion in the final quarter of 2022.\n\n\n\n",

    "title": "This is why I'm getting AMZN calls for earnings",
    "selftext": "Guys! It's finally happening. Amazon is releasing their earnings today. The stock moved down last earnings, up the one prior, down the one before that, up before that. It's been kinda bouncing back and forth. So you might think I'm uncertain this time around, but I'm not. [Link to my previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1kbnosv/everything_about_metas_earnings_tonight/) on META. [Link to my RDDT post for today's earnings](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1kcgypg/why_im_getting_calls_for_rddts_earnings_today/). Now that I've established my track record, let's get into it. \n\nRight now it\u2019s all about tariffs, of course. Has anyone read the recent report that suggested the company might start showing tariff costs on product listings? That resulted in a phone call from Trump to Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. Predictably, Amazon afterwards denied the claim, stating the proposal was \u201cnever approved\u201d and that displaying tariff costs \u201cis not going to happen.\u201d Lmao.\n\nStill, questions linger. [Loop Capital\u2019s Rob Sanderson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rob-sanderson-7b049947/), a 5-star analyst ranked among the top 4% of Wall Street pros, notes it\u2019s unclear how Amazon will deal with all this recent tariff bs. According to management, though, the likely scenario is straightforward: third-party sellers will simply pass on the higher costs to customers.\n\nThat, says Sanderson, will have \u201csome elasticity impact on demand but is GMV accretive on a unit basis.\u201d In any case, while it remains to be seen how the company will manage Chinese supply for 1P sales and \u201chow quickly it passes through price increases,\u201d he thinks it is \u201conly a transitory risk at worst.\u201d\n\nTariff chaos aside, as for what to expect from the readout, Sanderson believes the consumer environment in Q1 remained sluggish but largely in line with expectations, and that Amazon performed well under the circumstances. The Department of Commerce\u2019s proxy for e-commerce (non-store retailer sales) grew 4.2% in Q1, with growth accelerating each month and reaching 6.1% in March. The truth is, retail stores are dying and companies like amazon are picking up the slack. [Online shopping will be a majority of all shopping very soon.](https://optinmonster.com/online-shopping-statistics/) And because of this, AMZN is one of my longer share holds.  \n\nGoing back to what the analyst was saying specifically in regards to today's earnings: \u201cThis bodes well for 1Q results if directionally correct with management providing guidance off the weakest month of the quarter.\" He also thinks these trends have mostly carried into April and that tariff-related volatility has not yet had a significant impact on consumer spending.\n\nAs industry checks across cloud service providers (CSPs) indicate sustained positive momentum despite broader macro uncertainty, I believe AWS will deliver solid results today. The consensus margin estimate of 35.7% (a 190 basis point year-over-year decline) could turn out to be conservative, even when accounting for increased CapEx and a revenue mix shift toward generative AI, which I assume comes with lower margins.\n\nThis is taking place against a backdrop where the digitization of workflows has become a top priority for execs globally, driven by the rise of generative AI. While mainstream IT use cases for AI are still taking shape, there is an \u201cabundance of demand\u201d from early adopters, and even slower-moving companies are accelerating their cloud migration efforts. As budgets are already funded, Sanderson doesn\u2019t expect significant budget changes unless companies face major spending cuts.\n\nDid anyone see the Google results last week? I did a post on GOOG as well. Their results reinforce this view with strong growth at GCP and commentary on capacity shortages and inability to meet current demand.\n\nBottom line, ahead of earnings, Sanderson maintained a Buy rating on AMZN shares, while his $285 price target factors in a 12-month gain of ~50%. ([Sanderson\u2019s track record](https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/rob-sanderson)) Like I said, I have shares as a long term hold. For earnings however, I got [AMZN 1/16/26 230c](https://i.imgur.com/odrEvKu.png). This is a position I purchased a while ago, and it's unfortunately down quite a bit. But I think with today's earnings, it'll be good.",

Kodak is undergoing a **structural transformation**, pivoting from a declining legacy print business into higher-margin verticals such as **pharmaceutical manufacturing and advanced materials**. Despite strong **underlying asset value**, significant **hidden real estate assets**, and a **near-term deleveraging catalyst**, the stock trades at **only 0.4x book value**, well below its intrinsic worth.\n\nWe believe **Wall Street misprices Kodak** by failing to incorporate:  \n\u2705 The **imminent launch of its pharma division in 2025**, with attractive margin dynamics.  \n\u2705 **Debt reduction from pension surplus**, improving FCF and balance sheet health.  \n\u2705 **Strong tariff tailwinds under the Trump administration**, positioning Kodak as a beneficiary of U.S. domestic manufacturing policies.  \n\u2705 **Underappreciated real estate assets (Eastman Business Park)**, with a potential fair value of **$175M-$200M**.\n\n# Valuation Snapshot\n\n|**Metric**|**Base Case ($/Share)**|**Bear Case ($/Share)**|**Bull Case ($/Share)**|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|**DCF Valuation**|**$18.42**|**$11.63**|**$24.00**|\n|**Liquidation Value**|**$17.78**|**$12.50**|**$22.50**|\n|**EV/EBITDA Valuation**|**$12.30**|**$9.75**|**$15.00**|\n|**P/E Valuation (12x Earnings)**|**$11.35**|**$8.50**|**$13.50**|\n|**Current Market Price**|**$6.79**|**$6.79**|**$6.79**|\n\n\ud83d\udccc **Our target price of $18.50 is based on a blended DCF and sum-of-the-parts valuation.**\n\n# 1. Company Overview & Strategic Pivot\n\nKodak operates across **four primary segments**:\n\n1. **Print & Imaging (55% of 2024 revenue)**\n   * Declining legacy business, but Kodak is stabilizing margins at **20% gross margin**.\n2. **Advanced Materials & Chemicals (22%)**\n   * High-margin segment (**27% EBITDA margin**) that supplies key specialty chemicals.\n3. **Brand Licensing & Real Estate (10%)**\n   * Kodak owns **Eastman Business Park (EBP), a 1,200-acre industrial park** undervalued on the balance sheet.\n4. **Pharmaceuticals (13% by 2025)**\n   * New revenue driver, projected to **generate $149M in 2025 with 35% margins**.\n\nKodak\u2019s **pharmaceutical expansion** is the primary catalyst for **margin improvement and revenue diversification**. With **government incentives supporting domestic drug manufacturing**, Kodak is well-positioned for long-term growth.\n\n# 2.

Key Catalysts & Upside Drivers\n\n# 3.1 Pension Surplus & Debt Reduction\n\n* Kodak **will use $315M in pension assets to reduce debt**, lowering interest costs by **$25M annually**.\n* **Net debt will decline to $145M, reducing leverage to 0.7x EBITDA.**\n* This **significantly increases Free Cash Flow (FCF) starting in 2025**.\n\n# 3.2 Pharma Division Launch in 2025\n\n* Kodak\u2019s **API (Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient) manufacturing facility** is near completion.\n* The pharma sector offers **30%-40% gross margins**, significantly higher than print.\n* **Government incentives for domestic API production could drive contract wins.**\n* **Projected revenue: $149M in 2025 \u2192 $250M by 2029.**\n\n# 3.3 Trade Tariff Tailwinds\n\n* **Trump\u2019s trade policies favor U.S. manufacturers** in specialty chemicals and pharma.\n* Tariffs on **Chinese imports** could make Kodak\u2019s products **more competitive**.\n* **Kodak is well-positioned as a U.S.-based supplier**.\n\n# 3.4 Real Estate Monetization - Hidden Value in EBP\n\n* **Eastman Business Park (EBP)** is worth **$175M-$200M**, but it\u2019s booked at **$60M**.\n* Leasing out or **selling portions of EBP could unlock value**.\n\n# 4.

Conclusion: A Deep Value Play\n\nKodak presents a **compelling risk-reward opportunity** driven by:\n\n1. **Pharma division launch in 2025** (high-margin growth engine).\n2. **Debt reduction through pension surplus**, boosting FCF.\n3. **Hidden real estate value in Eastman Business Park**.\n4. **Trade tailwinds under Trump favoring domestic manufacturing**.\n\n\ud83d\udccc **Rating: Overweight**  \n\ud83d\udccc **Target Price: $18.50** (172% upside)\n\nKodak is a **highly asymmetric deep-value opportunity** with significant potential for re-rating in 2025. \ud83d\ude80\n\n\n\n# ELI5: Why Kodak is a Good Investment Right Now \ud83d\udcc8\n\nImagine you have **an old company like Kodak**, which used to make cameras and films. People think it\u2019s outdated, but here\u2019s the **secret**\u2014Kodak is quietly transforming into something much bigger. And **Wall Street isn\u2019t paying attention yet**.\n\nHere\u2019s why **smart investors** might want to take a closer look at Kodak:\n\n# 1\ufe0f\u20e3 Kodak Is Getting Into Pharmaceuticals (Drugs \ud83d\udc8a)\n\n* Kodak is **building a factory** to make ingredients for medicines.\n* This **new business starts in 2025** and will make **a lot more money per dollar spent** than selling old-school film and prints.\n* Think of it like Kodak **switching from selling DVDs to streaming movies\u2014it\u2019s the future!**\n* **This new drug business could bring in over $250M a year** in just a few years.\n\n# 2\ufe0f\u20e3 Kodak Is Paying Off a TON of Debt \ud83d\udcb0\n\n* Kodak had **a special pension fund with $1.08 BILLION** saved up.\n* They will use **$315M to pay down debt**, meaning they **don\u2019t have to pay as much interest anymore**.\n* **This frees up an extra $25M per year!**\n* Less debt = **stronger company + more money to grow the business**.\n\n# 3\ufe0f\u20e3 Hidden Gold Mine: Kodak Owns a HUGE Industrial Park \ud83c\udfed\n\n* Kodak owns **Eastman Business Park (EBP)**, a **1,200-acre** industrial site.\n* Right now, it\u2019s on the books for **only $60M**, but it\u2019s actually worth **$175M+**.\n* If they **sell or rent out more space**, Kodak could **make a lot of extra money**.\n\n# 4\ufe0f\u20e3 The Government Might Help Kodak (Trump's Trade Policies \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8)\n\n* The U.S. **wants to make more stuff at home** (like medicine and tech parts).\n* Kodak **makes things in America**, which means **they could get government support** and win new contracts.\n* If new tariffs (taxes on foreign goods) happen, Kodak\u2019s **U.S.-made products become more valuable**.\n\n# 5\ufe0f\u20e3 Kodak\u2019s Stock Is TOO CHEAP \ud83d\udcc9\n\n\ud83d\udccc **Right now, Kodak is trading at $6.79 per share.**  \n\ud83d\udccc **Experts say it should be worth between $11.50 - $24.00 per share!**  \n\ud83d\udccc That means the stock **could DOUBLE or even TRIPLE** in price.\n\n# \ud83d\udca1 What\u2019s Next?\n\nKodak is **no longer just an \u201cold camera company.\u201d** With **pharma, real estate, and smart debt moves**, it **could become a big winner** in the next couple of years.\n\n\u2705 **New drug business = more profits**  \n\u2705 **Less debt = more cash to grow**  \n\u2705 **Hidden assets = even more value**  \n\u2705 **Government policies = possible tailwinds**\n\n**Right now, Wall Street isn\u2019t paying attention\u2026 but soon, they might.** \ud83d\ude80 \n\n\n\nSources:  \n[https://investor.kodak.com/financial-information/sec-filings](https://investor.kodak.com/financial-information/sec-filings)  \n  \n[https://www.rochesterfirst.com/news/business/local-business/kodak-pharmaceutical-ingredient-factory-nearing-completion/amp/](https://www.rochesterfirst.com/news/business/local-business/kodak-pharmaceutical-ingredient-factory-nearing-completion/amp/)\n\n[https://www.wsj.com/articles/kodak-prepares-to-terminate-u-s-pension-book-gain-of-more-than-500-million-d0cfb621](https://www.wsj.com/articles/kodak-prepares-to-terminate-u-s-pension-book-gain-of-more-than-500-million-d0cfb621)  \n  \n[https://www.rochesterfirst.com/news/business/local-business/kodak-looks-to-terminate-us-pensions-will-gain-over-500-million-in-finances/](https://www.rochesterfirst.com/news/business/local-business/kodak-looks-to-terminate-us-pensions-will-gain-over-500-million-in-finances/)  \n  \n[https://www.rochesterfirst.com/news/business/local-business/kodak-increases-film-production-capacity-to-meet-commercial-consumer-demand/](https://www.rochesterfirst.com/news/business/local-business/kodak-increases-film-production-capacity-to-meet-commercial-consumer-demand/)  \n  \n[https://www.alcircle.com/news/kodak-s-call-for-tariffs-answered-us-to-impose-hefty-duties-on-imported-aluminium-printing-plates-112353?srsltid=AfmBOoqcAD-pC6yafn8auf4oN60aQaPUrgDLx2vh3zrUHHJyXT-TQNqx](https://www.alcircle.com/news/kodak-s-call-for-tariffs-answered-us-to-impose-hefty-duties-on-imported-aluminium-printing-plates-112353?srsltid=AfmBOoqcAD-pC6yafn8auf4oN60aQaPUrgDLx2vh3zrUHHJyXT-TQNqx)  \n\n\nBonus, real life DD:  \n  \nI did not know, but check how active are the Kodak clients/fans on other subredits there are literally dozens of posts each day including the word \"Kodak\".   \nAlso, the 90s are trendy these days, it is not unusual to see Gen Z youngsters with analogic cameras.",

You're betting on the stock and your betting again that this company won't pull shenanigans again. SMCI has a darkside but they're also successful and crafty. How long does this run last?  I think NVDA ultimately dumps them, maybe not suddenly, as they need to protect themselves, but there are better options. This stock ran up was incredible last year, almost too much, that was the first red flag in my opinion.\n\nI opened up a position in DELL .\n\nMy investment strategies are 95% long term, mostly stocks and ETF's i.e., VGT, FTHI, IWF, IYF, & JEPI . FTHI and JEPI both pay decent monthly dividends.  I mostly invest in tech stocks as I work in tech.  CRWD, AMD, AMZN, PANW and I really like the SMR for powering the hyperscale data centers.",

I can imagine META employees dumping their stock and not holding, GOOGL employees usually do auto sale, but the ones who kept it and didn't sell probably did well.\n\nMSFT and AAPL employees also did well.

As the holiday season approaches, technology procurement leaders at major enterprises are busy prioritizing their technology spending plans for 2025. These budget adjustments could signal potential changes in market share and spending direction.\n\n\n\nWhile OpenAI and Microsoft are getting a lot of attention in the AI space, a new CIO (chief information officer) survey shows that Alphabet (GOOGL.O) is rapidly coming into its own in the enterprise AI spending race.\n\n\n\nPiper Sandler's 2025 CIO Survey, which was released over the weekend, interviewed 81 CIOs about their budget priorities for different vendors and technology areas.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe tech industry will be dynamic in 2025,\u201d Piper Sandler's analyst team writes, \u201dwith generative AI transitioning from the testing/planning phase to implementation and driving growth in cloud spending.\u201d\n\n\n\nAnalysts noted that 87 percent of CIOs expect their IT budgets to increase in 2025, the highest percentage since the survey began in 2020.\n\n\n\nThe popularity of Google Cloud increased significantly compared to the previous two surveys. In the \u201cmost strategic\u201d AI vendor category, Google Cloud received 27 percent support, up from 15 percent six months ago. Meanwhile, Microsoft, the former leader, saw its support drop from 33% to 24%.\n\n\n\nGoogle Cloud also topped the ranking of AI infrastructure providers. When asked which cloud company they plan to test or implement AI projects with next year, 50 percent of respondents chose Google Cloud.\n\n\n\nOverall, this is good news for the major cloud infrastructure providers.The uptick in interest in AI applications and projects has led to higher spending intentions than six months ago for all providers, including Microsoft Azure, Amazon AWS, Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI).\n\n\n\nThe trend has been equally favorable to the parent companies of these cloud companies - Microsoft, Amazon (AMZN.O), Alphabet and Oracle (ORCL.N).\n\n\n\nIt's also a big plus for NVIDIA (NVDA.O), according to Harsh Kumar, a semiconductor analyst at Piper.\n\n\n\nAll cloud companies are big customers of NVIDIA's AI chips. NVIDIA holds more than 70 percent of the AI GPU (graphics processing unit) market, according to analysts.Kumar expects the AI chip market to exceed $500 billion by 2028.\n\n\n\nIf CIOs' budget plans come to fruition, 2025 will be a major growth year for AI. Investors are already picking up on the trend, with Alphabet's shares having risen nearly 15 percent this month.\n\nPersonally, I think the short-term risk is high and the better strategy in the long run is to buy low\n\n",

From infrastructure support (e.g., in-house chips Inferentia and Trainium) to service-level AI models and development tools, AWS is building a complete ecosystem. This update may focus on the following areas:\n\nGenerative AI services: the key to competing with Microsoft and Google may be to expand the application scenarios of already existing AI services, such as healthcare, finance and other high value-added industries\n\nModel optimization and cost reduction: through hardware improvement and algorithm optimization, it is cheaper and more efficient for customers to run AI models in the cloud.\n\nIndustry customized solutions: AWS's industry cloud strategy may be further deepened to create customized solutions for customers with the help of AI.\n\nFor investors, AWS's AI strategy is not only related to the market share of its cloud computing business, but also directly affects Amazon's overall revenue [performance.AWS](http://performance.AWS) already contributes nearly 70% of Amazon's operating profit, and further strengthening of its AI technology and services will help Amazon consolidate its position as a tech giant and provide sustained growth momentum for its stock (AMZN), which is currently on an uptrend that expects the stock to reach $230 in the next two months.\n\nThe above is my personal opinion and is for reference only",

    "title": "$RIVN: Riding to Valhalla",
    "selftext": "Alright, degenerates. Rivian isn\u2019t just the dorky little brother of Tesla anymore\u2014it\u2019s the ex-nerd who\u2019s going to show up at the 10-year reunion ripped and in a tux, ready to steal the prom queen. This play has all the makings of a **10x banger** if you\u2019re willing to hold on like your life depends on it. Buckle up, because this ride is going 0 to 69 faster than you can swipe right.\n\n## Why Rivian Is About to Deliver\n\n**Tesla\u2019s Fumbling the Ball** \n\nElon\u2019s gone off the deep end and is alienating the very crowd that made EVs sexy to begin with. Progressive elites? Millennials? The kinds of people who buy organic kale and want their car to save the planet? Yeah, they\u2019re turning the corner to RIVN, who\u2019s out here whispering sweet nothings about sustainability, inclusivity, and not being a hot mess. Basically, Tesla\u2019s stuck doing the walk of shame while Rivian\u2019s already at brunch ordering mimosas.\n\n**How Rivian Could Ride Trump\u2019s EV Rollercoaster**\n\nYou\u2019d think Trump and EVs go together like oil and water, but here\u2019s the twist: RIVN could totally benefit from his likely \u201cAmerica First\u201d policies. With Rivian\u2019s production fully based in the U.S., any federal push for domestic manufacturing would be a tailwind. Meanwhile, Trump\u2019s cozy relationship with Elon might have TSLA in the spotlight, but every infrastructure boost for Tesla chargers indirectly benefits RIVN since its vehicles now play nice with Tesla's Supercharger network. Most any other policy that benefits TSLA will help RIVN as well. Rivian\u2019s set to snag the benefits without the baggage, making it the sneaky winner here. Everyone\u2019s FOMOing into TSLA right now, but RIVN is the sleeper play here, and it\u2019s only a matter of time until the market realizes this.\n\n**New Models That\u2019ll Make You Feel Things** \n\nLet\u2019s talk about Rivian\u2019s R2 SUV and its new lineup. Starting at $45K, it\u2019s the hot-but-affordable option that\u2019s ready to steal hearts (and market share). Tri-motor setup? Level 3 autonomy? Integration with Tesla\u2019s Supercharger network? That\u2019s not just sexy\u2014that\u2019s full-blown EV porn. This isn\u2019t a one-night stand; Rivian\u2019s building long-term market appeal. And if that $45k price tag isn\u2019t inclusive enough for you Wendy\u2019s employees, they\u2019re adding a cheaper R3 model just for you (dumpster price point model still TBD).\n\n**Efficiency: More Bang for Their Buck** \n\nSure, Rivian\u2019s been burning through cash faster than you can dump your paycheck into hookers and blow, but they\u2019ve learned to keep it tight. Cutting the Georgia plant saved $2.25B, and now they\u2019ve found [a sugar daddy in Volkswagen to the tune of $5 billion](https://www.spglobal.com/mobility/en/research-analysis/rivian-volkswagen-production-forecast.html), exactly what they need to hold them over until their new models roll out. That\u2019s efficiency, baby.\n\n**Analysts Are Hot for RIVN**\n\n Some of the suits on Wall Street are swooning over Rivian. Their buy rating and price target of $15.67 give it a potential upside of 54%. They\u2019re hyped about Rivian\u2019s leaner operations, aggressive production targets, and a fat pipeline of new EVs. But there are still plenty of doubters who like losing money: [a short interest of 18%](https://fintel.io/ss/us/rivn) means the minute this stock turns around, the squeeze will make it run.\n\nRIVN shot from current levels all the way to $18 when the VW news first dropped, plus the recent pop to $12 when VW upped their commitment from $5B to $5.8B, but they\u2019re now being valued the same as they were before the deal existed. People who think a cash injection of half the company\u2019s market cap isn\u2019t going to move the needle are delusional. Not to mention they have $6.73B cash on hand, and they\u2019re only valued at $10B? Seems like a steal to me.  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tc3jgmanu32e1.png?width=1012&format=png&auto=webp&s=8b4d1888d8fc95e1f6fc9412032bb443304282aa\n\n## The Risks (Nothing to See Here)\n\n**Dilution** \n\nRivian\u2019s diluted more shares than a frat house dilutes vodka in jungle juice. But that jungle juice is funding some spicy R&D and scaling production, which means the hangover might just be worth it. And with VW\u2019s cash infusion (with potentially more in the future?) and affordable models on the horizon, they might not need to rely on dilution going forward.\n\n**Cash Burn**\n\nRivian\u2019s like the guy spending money he doesn\u2019t have to impress his date. Sure, it\u2019s a gamble, but if those new models hit like I think they will, it\u2019s a gamble that pays off big. Plus with Trump in the White House, do you honestly think he\u2019s going to let American manufacturing jobs disappear when that\u2019s all he talks about? Hell no, he\u2019ll make sure RIVN stays alive until their investments pay off.\n\n## TL;DR: \n\nRIVN isn\u2019t just another EV play\u2014it\u2019s *the EV play* for those with the balls to handle a little risk. With Tesla already overvalued and fumbling its game, Trump protectionism acting as the ultimate wingman, and Rivian\u2019s lineup of models hotter than a summer fling, the potential upside is enormous. Analysts see at least 50% upside, with room to double. This stock\u2019s the real deal, and I\u2019m strapping in for the ride.\n\nAnd if I haven\u2019t sold you on it, take it instead from this guy who turned $182k into $11.7 million:  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nf2e38yju32e1.png?width=966&format=png&auto=webp&s=021287bb576580c5ce190c54c2f8b7495f521944\n\nPosition: $35k in shares, 20 $35 Jan 2026 calls, 10 $20 Jan 2027 calls  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ev420hmou32e1.jpg?width=1179&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a1150f94bd0b078404049d6534e0b469878bec71\n\nEDIT: u/Additional-Ad-1021 and u/geraldor732 have some good points below too; expansion to Europe and potential for AMZN fleet purchases could be huge!",

    "title": "$BABA - The Azure of Asia-Pacific: Cloud Growth Could Send This Rocket to the Moon\u00a0\ud83d\ude80",
    "selftext": "TL;DR\n\nAlibaba ($BABA) is more than just an e-commerce behemoth; its cloud computing division, Alibaba Cloud, is leading the charge in Asia\u2019s explosive cloud growth. With Asia\u2019s cloud market expected to grow at a CAGR of 17.4% by 2028, this sleeping dragon might be your ticket to big gains. Let me break it down.\n\n\n\n1.\u00a0**Alibaba Cloud: The Azure of Asia-Pacific**\n\nIf Amazon has AWS and Microsoft has Azure, then Asia has Alibaba Cloud. It\u2019s already the #1 cloud provider in Asia-Pacific, with close to 40% market share. The division isn\u2019t just following Western models\u2014it\u2019s adapting to local markets and dominating. Countries like China, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand are leveraging Alibaba Cloud as their backbone for digital transformation. **A key differentiator is that unlike Amazon and Microsoft, Alibaba has proprietary GenAI in QWEN that rivals OpenAIs GPT offerings.**\n\nRecent milestones:\n\n\u2022 +7% YoY growth in cloud revenue last quarter, and triple-digit growth in AI\n\n\u2022 Launched Tongyi Qianwen, their ChatGPT competitor, tailored for enterprise solutions, giving them an AI edge. QWEN is ahead of GPT/OpenAI in several categories ([https://venturebeat.com/ai/alibaba-claims-no-1-spot-in-ai-math-models-with-qwen2-math/](https://venturebeat.com/ai/alibaba-claims-no-1-spot-in-ai-math-models-with-qwen2-math/))\u00a0 ([https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/25/technology/china-open-source-ai.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/25/technology/china-open-source-ai.html))\n\n\u2022 Collaboration with ByteDance, NIO, and other Asian giants.\n\nBy aligning with governments and enterprises,\u00a0**Alibaba Cloud is becoming indispensable in Asia\u2019s growing digital economy.**\n\n\n\n2.\u00a0**Asia\u2019s Cloud Market Is on Fire \ud83d\udd25**\n\nAsia-Pacific\u2019s cloud market is expected to grow from $120 billion in 2023 to $264 billion by 2028 (CAGR: 17.4%; this is greater than the US market at \\~12%). Alibaba\u2019s dominance in the region positions it to capture a lion\u2019s share of this pie. Here\u2019s why this is huge:\n\n\u2022 Cloud penetration is still low in Asia compared to the West. With increasing internet adoption, 5G expansion, and government incentives, the growth runway is long.\n\n\u2022 Alibaba\u2019s infrastructure covers 28 global regions and 90+ availability zones, but its home-field advantage in Asia gives it an edge Western competitors can\u2019t match.\n\n\n\n3.\u00a0**The Cloud Is Becoming Alibaba\u2019s Profit Engine**\n\nE-commerce might have built Alibaba, but cloud computing will carry it into the future. This is exactly what happened with Amazon and AWS. Let\u2019s connect the dots:\n\n\u2022\u00a0AWS accounts for 70%+ of Amazon\u2019s operating income.\n\nAlibaba Cloud isn\u2019t there yet, but it\u2019s trending in the same direction. Margins are improving as it scales, and with increased AI adoption, demand for compute resources will only grow.\n\n\u2022\u00a0China\u2019s e-commerce regulation hit BABA hard, but cloud revenue is regulation-light and critical for economic growth. The Chinese government even promotes Alibaba\u2019s cloud adoption for its national digital strategy and helps develop new contracts abroad ([https://www.asiafinancial.com/china-indonesia-sign-10bn-in-deals-on-evs-batteries-solar](https://www.asiafinancial.com/china-indonesia-sign-10bn-in-deals-on-evs-batteries-solar)).\n\n\n\n4.\u00a0**Dirt Cheap Valuation Compared to Western Cloud Giants**\n\nBABA is severely undervalued compared to its US counterparts. Look at this:\n\n|Metric|Alibaba ($BABA)|Microsoft ($MSFT)|Amazon ($AMZN)|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|P/E|10x|34x|62x|\n|Cloud Revenue CAGR|\\~30% in Asia|\\~20% globally|\\~25% globally|\n\nWhy? China FUD. But if you believe in the secular growth trend of cloud computing in Asia, this valuation gap screams opportunity. Also, aside from Asia, Alibaba is constructing a new data center in Mexico ([https://www.theregister.com/2024/05/24/alibaba\\_cloud\\_mexico\\_asia\\_expansion/](https://www.theregister.com/2024/05/24/alibaba_cloud_mexico_asia_expansion/))\n\n\n\n5.\u00a0**The Macro Tailwinds Are Strong**\n\nLet\u2019s not ignore the China reopening play and China\u2019s commitment to stimulate the economy. Add in Beijing\u2019s recent pro-business rhetoric, and $BABA could see significant upside. Plus:\n\n\u2022\u00a0Alibaba\u2019s $25 billion buyback program means it\u2019s returning value to shareholders at an aggressive pace.\n\n\u2022\u00a0Spin-offs on the horizon: The cloud division could IPO in the future, unlocking massive shareholder value. Think AWS spin-off rumors but real. Let\u2019s not forget that ANT \ud83d\udc1c is back!! ([https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jack-ma-backed-ant-profit-121522222.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jack-ma-backed-ant-profit-121522222.html)); ([https://www.scmp.com/tech/big-tech/article/3286177/ant-backed-credit-rating-firm-gets-central-bank-approval-china-after-3-year-wait](https://www.scmp.com/tech/big-tech/article/3286177/ant-backed-credit-rating-firm-gets-central-bank-approval-china-after-3-year-wait))\n\n\n\n6.\u00a0**Price Targets and Risks**\n\n\u2022\u00a0Base case: $150 in 12 months (30% upside).\n\n\u2022\u00a0Bull case: $200+ if cloud growth accelerates (70%+ upside).\n\n\u2022\u00a0Bear case: Regulatory crackdowns re-emerge, though unlikely given current trends. \n\n\n\n**Final Thoughts:**\n\nAlibaba is a rare mix of value and growth with a transformative cloud business that\u2019s only scratching the surface of its potential. The Asian cloud market is exploding, and BABA\u2019s position as the \u201cAzure of Asia\u201d gives it an unbeatable edge. Don\u2019t sleep on this one\u2014when the market realizes the true potential of Alibaba Cloud, $BABA will soar.\n\nOne more thing, it\u2019s chairman Joe Tsai is on a winning-streak. He invested $150M of his family fund into more shares of $BABA, and let\u2019s not forget that the NY Liberty just won the WNBA title. The Brooklyn Nets aren\u2019t there yet, but that doesn\u2019t change that Joe Tsai is one very smart China bull! His strategic vision as chairman is up there with the top CEOs we look-up to today ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8znIj2ML\\_Vo&t=11s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8znIj2ML_Vo&t=11s))\n\n\n\n**P.S. for Key Concerns:**\n\n1. Many of you Apes \ud83e\udd8d fear Chinese investments because of regulatory concerns and the Republic overstepping. We saw what happened after Jack Ma criticized the financial infrastructure and compared it to a pawn shop. Over the years, China realized that they would benefit from leveraging Alibaba\u2019s technology and have shifted their tone and relationship. Here is a recent article from Summer 2024 in China shared that Alibaba is in harmony with the republic ([https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Companies/Alibaba-s-3-year-antitrust-rectification-is-over-Beijing-says](https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Companies/Alibaba-s-3-year-antitrust-rectification-is-over-Beijing-says))\n\n1. Another key China concern since the election are US tariffs moving to 60%. Aside from this being a negotiation tactic that will likely not come to fruition, international e-Commerce is growing for Alibaba and it is not attributed to the US (\\~9% of Alibaba\u2019s international ecommerce is attributed to the US). With news of the Chinese megaport in Peru, South America is going to become a huge importer of Chinese goods TAX-FREE [https://www.wsj.com/world/china-xi-jinping-latin-america-acf6dbc1](https://www.wsj.com/world/china-xi-jinping-latin-america-acf6dbc1)\n\n\n\n  \n**Positions:**\n\nAfter earnings on Friday, I loaded 420 shares of $BABA and 120 $100 calls for 12/6. Across all accounts, I have about 700 shares and am considering leaps into late 2025.",

    "title": "Stocks that are going to go nuclear, no, literally.",
    "selftext": "You have seen in recent news that lots of data centers and AI fueled companies are looking for sustainable carbon free energy. That still isn't enough for the likes of amzn, and msft. They need sustainable STABLE energy. Nuclear is the only real option to hit this. Wind and solar energy are not feasible and if we are honest to ourselves, they simply aren't efficient enough. This is why nuclear is needed. \n\nMany disasters have occured: chernobyl, three mile island, and fukushima to name a few. This has caused the public to have a negative outlook on the technology. Many people believe wrongly that these reactors will destroy the world, when in fact post construction they are some of the safest forms of energy production.\n\nThe issue in the past with traditional reactors are that these projects are super fund sites. BILLIONS of dollars, government regulations bloat the cost and balloon the build time. In order to get a new design, the government is the only source. A lengthy billion+ dollar gamble so most build off the last approved design making small improvements. \n\nEnter SMR's , small modular nuclear reactors. They are extremely small sites in comparison to traditional monstrosities. The safety zone surrounding a SMR set up is limited to the bounds of the actual generator site. This is a big deal because with traditional reactors you have to build out a secured zone 10+ miles around the actual sites perimeter. The costs continuously add up for traditional economies. \n\nWho is designing SMRS? Tons of people are attempting but it no longer matters. As of 2020, the company NuScale is the only company in the united states with an approved reactor design. Other companies attempting to design and theorize have already gained support from the private industry in most recent history Amazon did so. They are giving money to start ups who are 10+ YEARS behind NuScale in hopes of getting in early.\n\n  \nNuScale has lost money year over year but have done amazing at cutting down on costs and bloat reducing their year over year expenses drastically. They have received government assistance already in 2014 (https://www.energy.gov/ne/articles/doe-approves-award-carbon-free-power-project), to the tune of 1.4b USD from the DOE which means government relations have already been built. \n\nThey went to deploy and test the reactors by building a 12 module reactor but fear of extra costs and hitting deadlines drove off private investors causing a halt on the project. AND YET NuScale performed relatively well in sustaining its value for a startup that's never made money. They continue to strive for a mid 2025 start to selling and commercializing their product to prove to the world it is safe and possible. I don't really think I need to explain in depth how AI data super centers, mass surveillance, quantum computing, and the general virtualization of everything will continue to drive the demand for stable sustainable energy and how that relates to NuScale.\n\n  \nYou may ask the following: \"How is this a small risk investment if you're claiming such higher performance?\", \"How are you sure we are going to go nuclear? The coming administration in the US wont be favorable to renewables!\", \"How do you think even if we are it will happen on a short time span?\"\n\n  \nI have answers. \n\n  \nEven if NuScale goes tits up in debt, has no way of securing contracts, gets beat out my competitors (impossible lol), IT STILL HAS ITS APPROVED DESIGN. That is their (for lack of a better term) trump card. It is worth the 24$ alone depending on who scoops them up to finish the mission. This leads me into the second nuclear stock. To supply this industry uranium will be needed. The government has been looking for a domestic supplier of fuel grade uranium that is ready for enrichment. Sadly, the enrichment game is mostly private holdings can't get in on that public goodness. But Uranium Energy Corp. has been making money moves, aquiring LIQUIDATABLE uranium and hodling it as hard as they can. Increasing mining, storage, and infrastructure capacities. They are ready for the next move. The united states is already trying to bid on BOTH A GenIII+ nuclear reactor(https://www.energy.gov/oced/generation-iii-small-modular-reactor-program), as well as a domestic supplier and enricher of fuel grade uranium(https://www.energy.gov/articles/biden-harris-administration-announces-four-contracts-boost-domestic-haleu-supply-and) <-- they have one for Low enriched as well.\n\nThe government is cheap and wants to save money. They have made a report investigating the savings made per killowat compared to the incentives given. They found they gave out 50+ billions and made jack shit return. They equated to do the same garbage return rate they'd only have to use 10 billion for the SMR tech coming out if they support the role out. \n\nEven with trump in office these stocks make sense to invest in for both hodling potential and short term options gamba. The government is already in favor of this, they will do whatever they need to change the public perception Hell, they don't even care., They will executive order whatever they need.  The following are reasons a trump office will help nuclear.\n\nHe has already stated that he will slash 4 or however many regulations per passed regulation. This will benefit all industries regardless of how you feel about it on an emotional level. Furthermore he wants a stronger American offense and defense. Putting SMRs into most states after commercial shows its viability will make for an invasion insurance, solar flare insurance, EMP insurance, supernova insurance, etc. SMRs are off grid capable. They can provide direct power hence the stability for data centers. If the grid goes down SMR's keep pumping. The steam they produce in the next generation will be more efficiently harvested for chemical manufacturing of ammonia and other reagents.\n\nEven with a strong want to continue using fossil fuels for trump, all the fossil fuel industries benefit. With the minimal space requirements needed essentially anywhere near any industry center a nuclear reactor could be built. And on the same page, lets talk about the building of this reactor(s) and its module(s).\n\n  \nIt is a modular system and NuScale has already put thought and money into fabrication plants to create the modular components, as well as invested in what they call E2 centers across the globe to train professionals to work at NuScale reactor sites. They aren't a tech bullshit startup with false promises they are actively confident and preparing for a 3 year explosion into the industry. They have made talks and contracts and centers in eastern europe namely romania, they have done the same in the middle east, they have done the same in africa specifically full blown university support from Ghana(https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/ghana-signs-agreement-build-small-nuscale-nuclear-reactor-2024-08-29/). This shit is happening but retail regards still have their head in the sand. I think the big boys are waiting to blow this shit up over night in the coming few years.\n\n  \nI bought in at 22 something and it hit almost 26 the other day. UEC is a bit more volatile but in the exact same boat. This isnt a source of uncorrelated returns, these markets are both going online. And if tariffs happen, these people are MOONING. The signs are right in our faces.\n\nFINAL KEY POINTS AND WRAP UP FOR THE TLDREGARDS:\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Nuclear energy is happening short term and already has DOE support.\n\n\\*\\*\\*ONLY ENTITY THAT HAS AN APPROVED SMR DESIGN BY THE NUKE COMITEE IN THE US\\*\\*\\*\n\n\\*\\*TRUMP SLASHING REGS ++ TARIFFS??\\*\\*\n\n\\*\\*UEC MEETS DOE FUTURE GOALS AS DOMESTIC URANIUM SUPPLY\\*\n\n\\*US ALLIES URANIUM SUPPLIES FACE UNCERTAINTIES WHICH MEANS $$$$ FOR US SALES\\*\\*\n\n\\*\\*MINIMAL RISK LONG TERM AS THEY BOTH HAVE AN EXTREMELY VALUABLE INTRINSIC ASSET REPSECITVELY\\*\\*\n\n\\*\\*EVERYTHING IS ON SCHEDULE ACCORDING TO NUSCALE SMR Q3 REPORT\\*\\*\\*\n\n  \nSOURCES::\n\n  \n[https://www.energy.gov/ne/articles/doe-approves-award-carbon-free-power-project](https://www.energy.gov/ne/articles/doe-approves-award-carbon-free-power-project)\n\nhttps://www.energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2018/11/f57/Examination%20of%20Federal%20Financial%20Assistance%20in%20the%20Renewable%20Energy%20Mark...\\_1.pdf\n\n[https://www.energy.gov/oced/generation-iii-small-modular-reactor-program](https://www.energy.gov/oced/generation-iii-small-modular-reactor-program)\n\n[https://www.energy.gov/articles/biden-harris-administration-announces-four-contracts-boost-domestic-haleu-supply-and](https://www.energy.gov/articles/biden-harris-administration-announces-four-contracts-boost-domestic-haleu-supply-and)\n\n[https://www.nuscalepower.com/en/news/press-releases/2024/nuscale-power-reports-third-quarter-2024-results](https://www.nuscalepower.com/en/news/press-releases/2024/nuscale-power-reports-third-quarter-2024-results)\n\n[https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/ghana-signs-agreement-build-small-nuscale-nuclear-reactor-2024-08-29/](https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/ghana-signs-agreement-build-small-nuscale-nuclear-reactor-2024-08-29/)\n\n",

    "title": "Here's why you should buy AMZN for earnings.",
    "selftext": "Hi everyone. I used to work at AMZN (AWS specifically) as a Cloud Engineer - I was there for nearly 5 years. In my time there, I made lots of friends, many of whom I still keep in contact with today (this will be important later).\n\nThe stock was $153 at the beginning of the year, ran up to $200, collapsed back to $150 in the August 5 dump, and has had a hard time breaking $195 since. Today is a rough day in the market, but it's only one day - overall, the market is pumping in an upward trend due to the upcoming election. Additionally, the market is due for a melt up next year.\n\nThere's a lot of resistance at $200 for AMZN, but with the upcoming earnings today, along with the upward market trend toward the end of the year, once we break through $200, it'll keep carrying.\n\nNow on to earnings: AMZN has lost a lot of high-paid employees over the past few months. Everyone knows about the RTO mandate that Jassy has implemented, and I've been hearing from multiple friends that people are leaving and looking for better opportunities elsewhere. **This is great for earnings**, as it shows that AMZN is cutting overhead costs for many of its departments, along with cutting several high-profile departments altogether. The AWS money machine continually grows, especially with the new services and tiers for each service it has been deploying - YoY growth is expected to increase. Additionally, the retail side of the company hasn't slowed down.\n\nLast, but not least, I ordered something from AMZN and they said it was going to arrive in 2 days, but it arrived in 1.\n\nMy position: 200 shares @ $187.09 avg, hold through the election. After my 200 shares, I had enough for a few calls, so I bought a lotto ticket of 195C Exp 11/1, although the 11/8 Exp would probably be better.\n\n4:10PM EDIT: The stock is up AH, but we need to break through $200. If we break through $200 AH, we should hold throughout the night and continue in an upward trend through tomorrow. If we do not break $200, we will be up but I'm not expecting a huge gain.\n\nThe actual earnings call will let us know where the stock is headed tomorrow.",

With Friday's trading volatility, his wealth is expected to increase even further.\n\nOn Thursday, Tesla reported mixed earnings, but the results were encouraging, with investors focusing on several factors including strong margins, earnings per share, net income, and the company's lowest-ever cost per item sold. This was Tesla's first earnings growth in seven quarters.\n\nMuch of this growth may also be attributed to Musk's new round of promises.\n\nHe predicted that Tesla will start offering carpooling in at least two states next year (California and Texas), where he plans to get approval from \u201cfully unsupervised\u201d Fully Self-Driving (FSD) regulators. Musk also revealed his \u201cbest guess\u201d for 2025 deliveries, which he said will increase by 20 to 30 percent, as Tesla plans to start selling more affordable models in early 2024. Tesla plans to sell more than 1.81 million electric vehicles in 2024.\n\nIn an earnings call with analysts, Musk said, \u201cI predict Tesla will be the most valuable company in the world, and probably by a long shot.\u201d\n\nMusk controls nearly 13 percent of Tesla's outstanding shares, but could buy more at a steep discount if his compensation plan is approved by the courts. He also owns a majority stake in SpaceX, which he leads, as well as artificial intelligence startup xAI and social media platform X (META) (formerly Twitter).\n\nTesla's gains on Thursday boosted Musk's net worth to about $270 billion, up $33.5 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. The index is updated at the close of the New York market. The Forbes Real-Time Billionaires Index is expected to grow by $26 billion on Thursday to about $269 billion. Musk's net worth increased by another $3 billion to nearly $273 billion as of Friday, Forbes reported.\n\nThe second-richest person on the list is Oracle Corporation ( ORCL ) founder and Musk ally Larry Ellison, with a net worth of $213.8 billion, according to Forbes. He was followed by Amazon (AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, with $207.7 billion and $200.5 billion, respectively.\n\nTesla shares were up more than 2 percent in regular trading Friday morning at about $266 a share, up 55 percent in the past six months. The stock is up just 6 percent so far this year.",

    "selftext": "\nTL;DR - Dad got cancer - so I went ham on investing \n\nI've been a long time lurker of this sub (and I never really post on reddit in general), but I didn't know where else to post this. I don't do options so maybe this is the wrong place lmao.\n\nI moved back home to my parents place when my dad was diagnosed with terminal brain cancer. Truthfully this has been the worst year of my life (and his obviously) in a lot of ways, but I've been investing since I was 16 (I'm 25 now). My dad worked in equities, so when he lost his ability to communicate effectively with me (and since I had significantly more income because I'm not paying rent) - I truthfully went ballistic on investing.\n\nPretty much said fuck it, I'm living at home I don't need a 6 month emergency fund till I move out and went all-in. Granted 40% of my portfolio not listed here is in a 401k account entirely in the S&P 500 (set & forget just in case my equities went to hell as with the rest of my life lol).\n\nI believe in the margin of safety when investing. I like to invest in high-quality companies that generate lots of cash as the backbone of my portfolio. Since 2021 (before my dad got this cancer shit), I spoke with him and he basically said just look at the fundamentals of a company and invest in growth companies that you think will be around in 5-10 years. I look for value within growth stocks (i know paradoxical). Some of my icons in investing are David Tepper & Michael Burry. Again below is all my own experience and reflects **only** my own views and are not a recommendation of my company (corporate. disclaimer).\n\n* My portfolio is heavily weighted (85%) between several stocks: AAPL, META, MSFT, GOOGL (So fucking cheap r u kidding me sorry), NVDA, AMZN, AMD, CRM, COST, RIVN (RIP), AVGO, VOO (ik not a stock) <-- I know semi(s) are very cyclical but i believe in holding all of these companies for 5-10 years, so I don't have to worry about temp. earnings beats/misses etc. Much easier to pick a stock and hold it for a while then it is to get the timing right. Roughly at 175% return in the past 3 years. (hammered META at $100's, NVDA at $200 both in 2022)\n* Roughly 15% of my bets are moonshots (note the word bet hehe) with promise but objectively could be overvalued/bad investments: CCL/RCL (both are crushing it and between them own 75% of the cruise line market), LCID/RIVN (going to 0 bc they can't scale profitably or will make u a very happy person 3 years down the line bc R2/Atlas at 45k/50k should capture a significant portion of model y demand), TTD, DKNG/FLUT - gambling hasn't even been legalized in Cali/Texas (the biggest markets in the U.S. come on), RBLX (feels like betting against youtube in the early innings w/o realizing how much rev. they're actually recognizing), PYPL (value - cheap af (bought at $60) should turn around in a couple years)\n\nI joke I allocate like google's budget where it's 90% bread&butter and the rest are moonshots.\n\nWas very depressed (still reasonably depressed) because I'm not sure how much time my dad has. I hope in a way I can pass some of these stocks to my kid in a better place than I found it. I don't know I'm crying as I write this. Fuck my life. It is what it is. \n\nCheers\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j8ym4lkamdvd1.png?width=1198&format=png&auto=webp&s=70c707919d6301944c8ff8cbbcb33ed03c9e6837",

Getting delayed in your travels by a train is just part of life here. Sometimes it\u2019s fun to look at the graffiti and sometimes it makes you want to spit nails. Anyway, you get accustomed to the various types of rail cars you see.\n\nSo, I\u2019m stuck waiting on a train for 10 minutes tonight and I see something unusual. It is LOADED with \u2018Prime\u2019 shipping containers. I\u2019ve never seen a train loaded with Amazon shipping containers. I confirmed with other people and they haven\u2019t seen them either. Also, these containers appeared to be young/new.\n\nNow, I know this isn\u2019t like spotting Bigfoot or some shit. But, it\u2019s gotta mean something. Either changes in routing for overseas cargo or maybe just using more trains and less semi-trucks to get your wife\u2019s boyfriend\u2019s shit to your house.\n\nI need someone not as smooth brained as I to assess this situation and tell me just how far OTM I need my calls to be. Prime days next week, holiday shopping season shortly thereafter with earnings in between. Think we could see some strong retail numbers and outlook to beat the general soft outlook of this retail season? ",

    "selftext": "1. **The CEO:** Only time will tell if PattyG is the Tony Stark of semiconductors or its Joey Tribbiani. But dude is workin hard to improve products and cut costs, including via layoffs (15%, ouch!) and capital expenses (paused fabs in Poland & Germany)\n2. **The USA:** Uncle Sam's got Intel's back! It\u2019s like getting a golden ticket from Willy Wonka, but instead of chocolate, it\u2019s billions in funding to boost their foundry business. So far, $8.5B under Chips Act + $3B from DOD. Sweet! Talk about a sugar rush.\n3. **The Rumored Buyers:** I think the whole Qualcomm buying Intel was just a head fake Qualcomm CEO Cristiano has a history of trolling the plebs he doesn't like. Both companies have too much product overlap for this to have ever made sense.The Apollo $5B thing is more real as they have already invested $8B in Ireland\n4. **The Tech:** Their Lunar Lake Laptop AI CPU is finally kicking some butt. Using 3nm TSMC, it has the fastest process whereas the competition (AMD & Qualcomm) are still at 5nm process, and s.l.o.w. AF.  Meanwhile on the foundry side, Intel got AMZN & other deals lined up for their 18A process with shipments for next year. Hallelujah!\n5. **The Charts:** The technicals look better everyday. It\u2019s trading above the 12 and 55 moving averages like a pro athlete clearing hurdles. And the RSI? It\u2019s giving us the thumbs up, saying, \u2018Nope, not overbought yet, keep on keepin' on!\u2019 It's up 27% since it hit rock bottom on September 10.\n\nWhen you put all of this together, it's hard to imagine the stock price going lower. Investing in Intel now is like betting on a field goal kicker - mostly you'll win, sometimes you'll win big, but sometimes you can lose big too. But, hey, it sure beats being a Jags fan in 2024!\n\nAgree? or No?",

    "selftext": "The problem areas in the USA: --------------------------\n\n\\*- The Schiller PE is at a very high level.  Only higher in 2021 and the Dot Com bubble.  So stocks are highly expensive.\n\n\\*- ISM manufacturing index has been in contraction since mid 2022!  We are more of a service economy than a goods economy,  but still when you have stocks priced for perfection this isn't what you want happening if you are a bull.\n\n\\*-  World's #2 economy, China is no longer growing to the point that it can move the global needle.  That is, global sales growing to the point where a company's local USA sales declines are offset.  Additionally the trade war hampers both sides.\n\n\\*- The consumer's savings have dropped back to 2022 levels.\n\n\\*- NVidia's leadership of the gainers was not sustainable and my one man's opinion is because their valuation is ten times the cash in the bank of all of their AI customers.  You have price to sales of 10 for all the money your customers could possibly spend on anything AI that NVidia sells in the short term.  People have said on this point that future earnings will be available and that customers can go to a bank.  However, clearly the price is high when you compare to say MKS Instruments and Applied Materials.  AMAT has more cash in the bank than MKSI is worth.  AMAT is MKSI's biggest customer, having a disproportionately large percentage of its sales.  So this means that in the short term, there is monetary potential energy for MKSI without loans nor future earnings, but it is not the same potential energy for NVidia.  This is not a marketing of MKSI stock BTW.  I don't own any MKSI.  This point applies to NVidia's AI GPUs that certainly the average person is not affording.  So the cash on hand is from MSFT, GOOG, META, AMZN.\n\nGood areas: --------------------------------------\n\n\\*- Labor productivity is up consistently since Q3 2022.  one can see \n\ntradingeconomics dot com USA productivity\n\n\\*- Gasoline is lower than last year\n\n\\*- Retail sales are going fine, \\[ per  a recent NPR radio article \\]\n\nNuetral ----------------------------------------\n\n\\*- Labor force participation is not higher than Sept 2023.  No more sales growth from people returning to work.  Participation is up recently. tradingeconomics has this info.\n\n\\*- Consumer confidence is still down since January 2020.\n\nMy one man's take ----------------\n\nThe problem areas are serious.  There is enough weight in the bear issues to cause the stock market to give up most of its gains this year.",

    "selftext": "I was inspired by this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1f5l4c6/update_what_if_you_had_just_bought_the_highest/) to take a closer look at various scenarios. My analysis assumes the stocks are bought once a month - at the beginning of every month. It can extended to rebalance everyday but not everyone can do that.\n\nInitial investment: $1,000\n\nMonthly investment: $100\n\n**Strategies**\n\n* Buy and hold: buy the top N market cap stocks of a given month. Do not sell the stock if it's not in the top N list in the following months.\n* Rebalance: If an existing stock in the portfolio is not in the top\\_n stocks list in the current month then  check when was the last month it was part of the top\\_n market cap stocks. If the resulting month difference is greater or equal to\u00a0`rebalance_threshold_months`\u00a0then sell the stock and tax the gains. The sale proceeds (minus short term taxes) are added to the monthly investment budget equally among the current top\\_n stocks. If there was a loss then I simply use the total sale proceeds. Eg, Assume AMZN was top 3 stocks last month but not this month.  If the threshold months is 1 then we sell AMZN this month, tax the gains, and distribute the sale proceeds equally to buy this months top 3 stocks.\n\nBacktesting. Start: 2018-1, ~~End: 2024-1.~~ Edit: End 2024-8.\n\n|Strategy|Rebalance threshold months|Top 5|Top 3|Top 1|SPY|QQQ|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Buy and hold|N/A|$20,793|$21,967|$17,530|$15,266|$17,989|\n|Rebalance.

    "selftext": "Hi regards,\n\nThis is not a \"copium\" post about the recent stock price drops.\n\nI am a 3rd world country regard who is a Software Engineer and I will share my insights into the industry with my broken ass English, if you want to join me on this journey, be my guest.\n\nThe problem with NVDA is that they are \"overhyped\" not \"overpriced\". Some of you regards might say that \"OH THEIR STOCK PRICE INCREASED 150% YOY HOW IS THAT NOT OVERPRICED\", I will kindly ask you to check their income growth, which sits at 122% YOY.\n\nFirst of all, lets compare some other tech giants earnings to NVDA earnings to see what they are \"worth now\".\n\n|Name|Stock price|EPS|SP/EPS ratio|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|AAPL|230|1,4|164|\n|MSFT|413|2,95|140|\n|AMD|145|0,16|1.035|\n|META|516|5,16|100|\n|AMZN|171|1,26|135|\n|NVDA|116|0,68|170|\n\nAs you can see above, they are not overpriced related to their current earnings. And I think that them going back to 110 will set them good for later improvements. But them getting hyped beyond recognition was the sole reason for them being priced at 130 per price.\n\nBut before jumping into the NVDA analysis, lets go over every single tech stock in that list.\n\n## AAPL\n\nLatest thing they achieved was M1 chip, converting old and worthless Macbook Pro hardware into a performing machine with great battery life. This was also accompanied by the fact that they can charge a premium for small hardware upgrades (200$ for a simple 256GB storage?), which helped them to sell new computers to their old customers and gain huge profits.\n\nHow do I know this? Because after 2021, when M1 chip proved to be powerful and resourceful, most of our Macbook stack got renewed. I was using a 6 years old work Macbook before that, because newer Intel Macbooks did not promise anything new.\n\nBut this was 3 years ago. Now, they are pretty much failing to create new income markets. Their latest tech demo \"Vision Pro\" failed miserably. Their only means to increase their income is to sell more hardware to push their services (AppStore and stuff), but this is also under investigation and they probably will have to open up their ecosystem more.\n\n## MSFT\n\nThey did suck tits before Nadella became a CEO. They tried to be a \"everything\" company but everything they did suck. Then Nadella came and transformed the rotting corpse of MSFT on the Golden Throne into the Cloud giant they are.\n\nThey are platformless. Their services are used everywhere. They are bringing Windows into ARM devices (again) and it does not suck this time. New ARM platform seems to outperform M series Macbooks in battery performance, which will end years of Macbook supremacy.\n\nThey are agile. They set and integrate trends easier. Game Pass? Azure? Cloud Office?\n\n## AMD\n\nI am a fellow AMD user (7900XTX gang?) and oh boy they are at least a few years behind in datacenter solutions. Also given their driver problem history on Desktop, power draw problems and other bugs, they need more resources to fix their problems first.\n\nAlso, sadly, they do not have CUDA. Personally, I am training some neural networks on my 7900XTX and it is 5 to 10 times faster than my CPU but also 5 to 10 times slower than NVDA counterpart. And also, I have to put in the extra work to find that specific framework that works with AMD and make the very specific adjustments before even I can start using the hardware.\n\nEven if their hardware can match NVDA, it is like having a really fast fighter jet without any software assistance, yeah you can MAYBE safely take off if you work hard enough, but you will never win against the jest with a strong software.\n\nAnd no one is buying their data center products (Other than their CPU's). I will get on this in NVDA's section.\n\n## META\n\nThey are a \"AD\" company, just like Google. They have some \"long game\" products (Metaverse and Google Self Driving as much as you joke them), but they are far from ALPHA phase. If they can show the world that this is the future, they might get a 60% to 90% increase in their value.\n\nALSO THEY ARE BUYING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF WORTH NVDA PRODUCTS.\n\n## AMZN\n\nThe \"everything company\". They are big. But not as much profitable as the rest. For me, their biggest product is AWS. If they can create a new income source they will be the next 3T company, may be even earlier than GOOGL.\n\n# NVDA\n\nAND OUR STAR CHILD.\nHOT TOPIC OF 2024.\nTHE FUTURE OF THE WORLD.\n\nDo you remember when they wanted to acquire ARM? This was back in 2020, when their market cap was around 145 BILLION. Do you know how much they were willing to spend on ARM? 40 BILLION DOLLARS. This was before the AI craze and boom in their revenue.\n\nSo why did NVDA wanted to acquire ARM? For their CPU's of course. They are going to create the Apple way of Datacenters. Soft spot of H100 series was their lack of integration between CPU and GPU. Blackwell aims to solve this. Finally, they are creating a whole SOC, with their new CPU, Grace.\n\nRemember what I told you in AAPL's section? The way their tight integration of M series chips with rest of the system made their profits skyrocket? Do you see what will Blackwell do for NVDA now?\n\nH100 users will have a clear path to upgrade, and with their newest technology, they will get MORE OF THE PIE on the single server rack. If NVDA made X thousand dollars of profits from a single server rack from H100 users, this will definitely go beyond 4X mark with Blackwell.\n\nAnd I previously mentioned no one was buying AMD. This was because in our company, we have bought A MILLION DOLLARS worth of NVDA datacenter products. There was a discussion in our team, if we should buy AMD datacenter GPU's because it was WAY cheaper, I mean 4-5 times cheaper. Everyone disagreed and we went with the NVDA GPU and AMD CPU, and we are just one team in a huge company.\n\nRemember when I told you I was a THIRD WORLD REGARD? Yeah. NVDA technologies are just spreading to this part of the world. Even we are spending MILLIONS of dollars for NVDA. And we are just starting to build up our NVDA datacenters. What do you think in 5 years, when it is time to upgrade, do you think that we will switch our provider and ditch all the work? Or do you think that we will go with NVDA and make them rich?\n\nLet the bears win some battles, so NVDA can win the war.\n\nEDIT: forgor some words",

    "title": "The next tech giant. Why $HOOD, $PLTR and $DKNG are the investment opportunities of a lifetime. (Part 1)",
    "selftext": "I believe the story of the last 20 years of stock market is that one tech startup can disrupt an entire sector and join the tech giant club. For many sectors, information is king and turns out a company with a few 1000 people who have studied the science of information can outperform millions of people who aren't so scientifically rigorous. Now some sectors are not so prone to be disrupted by these information science experts. And if you asked me 20 years ago which sectors will be disrupted in what order, I would've guessed wrong.\n\n$AMZN Turns out the value of millions of retail stores across the west was not in their inventory, their brand or their location. Amazon proved their value was in knowing who wants what item when and where. Information. How can millions of retail shop compete with amazon when they already have my payment information (how) my location (where) and all amazon has to figure out is what do I want, which I'm happy to tell them by typing one word or expression in a search bar instead of walking around Home Depot trying to find a employee who's not too busy and has every reason to avoid me. Sentences and social interactions just can't compete with 1s and 0s. Now I wish I figured this all out 20 years ago when amazon still a great investment opportunity, but how could I have known Jeff would overcome all the hurdles by building this impossible network of warehouses and delivery. I won't make the same mistake twice.\n\n$NFLX (movies). $SPOT (music) $GOOG,$META(ads, communication, media), $AAPL, $MSFT etc... These are 100% information sectors that I would've guessed would be disrupted. But these were winner takes all. How could I know Facebook wouldn't fail like MySpace and Friendster? That iphones would be better than blackberry and nokia? How could I know Yahoo would become a total failure when they had such a commanding lead in the early internet era. These stocks will keep going up but they're not the 100 baggers they once were.\n\nAnd so in true\u00a0wsb\u00a0fashion, the question becomes, what tech startup is poised to do the same thing to their respective sector. Let's assume no company can be worth over $5T in the next 10 years. We need a company worth less than $50B whose sector is still ripe for the taking, and whose in the business of information. A sector whose legal hurdles have kept the incumbents safe from the efficiency of tech startups. A sector who created legal barriers that could resist a decade longer than taxi drivers could resist $Uber, or hotels vs $ABNB.\n\nThere are 3 answers : Finance, defense and gambling. These sectors have the highest barrier to entry of any. Their regulatory agencies are basically just a revolving door between government and industry. They are the most regulated sectors out there but they are finally starting to crack. Crony capitalism only works for so long.\n\nFrom a pure computer science perspective, overtaking these sectors is not technical challenge, in the same way Unity is failing at becoming the universal game engine. There's no legal barrier to become a game engine. Activison, Take two interactive, Ubisoft, etc.. everyone wants $U to succeed but they're now years behind on their promised revolutionary Data oriented technology stack. Everyone wants $TSLA Full self driving to succeed, but they're years behind Musk's first promises of success by what? 2017?. But those are technically hard challenges, maybe impossible with current hardware limitations. Now if you want to bet on their success, good luck to you but I'm not interested in those investments. Only someone at the cutting-edge of those technologies can make well-informed decisions. Only someone at the cutting-edge of semi conducters could've guessed $NVDA would obliterate intel and amd. I won't pretend to have any such knowledge about the future as I make these observations about the past. This is not what this tech investment thesis is about.\n\nAnd so in conclusion, three stocks stand out in their positioning and the state of their respective industry :\n\nIf you are under 40 years old, $HOOD (Finance), $PLTR (Defense) and $DKNG (gambling) will 100x during your investment horizon. Part 2 tomorrow as I dive deeper on all 3.",

These are 40 stocks that Stacy's mom might not have heard of, but our millenial buddies use these products and services all the time. This is a serious list.\n\nTo start off, we'll go big in the cap spectrum.\n\nOur millenial buys AAPL products, uses MSFT Excel and Outlook at their \"Information Worker\" job. They are frequently gamers, so they need to buy NVDA GPUs and AMD CPUs. They often buy these at AMZN.\n\nThey buy YouTube Premium and YouTube TV, so they can skip the ads of their fellow influencers (GOOGL)\n\nThey spent most of their waking hours at META's Instagram website.\n\nThey drive a TSLA or RIVN.\n\nThey're on the GLP-1 drug (LLY) to impress their SOs.\n\nThey're churning their credit cards with AXP Platinum and Gold, JPM's Chase Sapphire Preffered (no, NOT Reserve), some younger ones need to rely on COF's Venture and Venture X cards that gave nice \"subs\".\n\nThey use these cards frequently to eat out and earn those points at CMG, SHAK and SG.\n\nThey're flying a lot on DAL, and they need their free wifi that is often sponsored by their preferred choice of mobile carrier, TMUS.\n\nTo get to the airport they need to use UBER or LYFT, since they don't want to drive their sweet electric ride. When they arrive at their destination airport, they pick up their rental car, and of course they prefer AVIS (CAR), but their credit cards give them presential circle status on HTZ, so they are ok with that too.\n\nThey check into their hotel room at Marriott (MAR) to impress their friends, but really they are using all their Chase points to book Hyatt (H) hotels. The slightly less premium young ones will have to go Hilton (HLT) and fly on UAL.\n\nThey often booked all this travel on EXPE or BKNG. Sometimes they use ABNB.\n\nWhen they check in they need to get some food, so they use their DASH gift card they bought at COST every two weeks because they get 20% off.\n\nWhen they go to Vegas, they prefer to stay in WYNN, because it's where all the hot ones stay.\n\nAfter they're done with their holidaying which they do basically 4 months out of the year, they're going to ULTA or LULU to buy their beauty products or Khakis.\n\nThey are drop shipping on SHOP and sometimes they need to use ZM to conduct \"business\" for their \"coaching classes\" that they teach. A lot of times they get paid using Venmo (PYPL).\n\nWhatever money they make, they buy call options on HOOD.\n\nAt the end of the day their sugar daddy's give them a $1m deposit so they can buy those nice suburban homes built by TOL and furnished by WSM.\n\nAnd of course, they spend their entire day on RDDT.",

    "title": "NVDA will beat earnings again this month!",
    "selftext": "Just to be clear this is not financial advice, and there are more factors than an earnings beat that affect stock price, but this is why I think NVDA will beat revenue predictions of $28B on Aug 28th 2024.\n\nThis article https://observer.com/2024/06/nvidia-largest-ai-chip-customers/ lists MSFT and META as the 2 biggest customers of NVDA chips last year (they spent $9B in 2023). Their total capex for 2023 is $55.3B combined. Which means that they spent 16.2% of their total Capex spending in 2023 on NVDA chips alone. So I looked at their Capex for this last quarter, which is $22.04B combined, up from $15.17B combined in Q2 2023 (up 45% YoY). The article also states that these 2 along with AMZN, and GOOGL make up a little less than 40% of all NVDA chip sales in 2023. So, I looked at their numbers as well. AMZN and GOOGL in Q2-2024 spent $30.80B on Capex, up from $18.33B in Q2 2023 (up 68% YoY). If we use the 16.2% of their capex rule on NVDA from 2023 then combined the 4 companies spent $8.56B in Q2 alone this quarter on NVDA chips.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fw6ulcq1nhhd1.png?width=606&format=png&auto=webp&s=c5f045bd5d7c8d10238567c37837319ed8ca71e3\n\nBut I think with such a huge increase YoY on Capex spending that the total % spent of capex on NVDA chips is closer to 30% at least. Which would mean they spent $15.82B on NVDA chips last quarter. Looking at NVDA\u2019s Q1 earnings they reported $22.5B in datacenter chip sales Q1. Meaning potentially 40% of their customer base has already purchased 75% of their total revenue in chip sales from Q1 2024 in Q2 2024. NVDA in their first quarter presentation is expecting $28.0B in total revenue for Q2 2024, which is 7.52% higher than what they reported in Q1 ($26.04B). Yet their biggest customers are reporting an avg increase in Capex spending of 19.33% from Q1 to Q2 in 2024. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ezyilod4ohhd1.png?width=846&format=png&auto=webp&s=e0db445fd539a08346afa26a840fd2253e9e0140\n\nI think this is a no brainer beat of the predicted $28B in revenue. Yet impacts to profit margins, chip shortages, and guidance changes of 2025 that are unknown mean the price action can't be accurately predicted. Invest at your own risk. I would love to hear others opinions on this upcoming earnings for NVDA and what they think could be reported.",

    "selftext": "The overwhelming sentiment I see here and from financial analysts regarding AI is that it's this hugely speculative new tech that has yet to yield any substantive fruit. \"What's the use case?\" \"Where are the giant growth numbers?\"\n\nAnd yet, in the early days of using generative AI, if the low-hanging fruit is simply increases in efficiency and easy-to-automate processes being automated, what we'd expect to see is not ballooning growth, but similar productivity with fewer human workers, wouldn't we? And don't the numbers support exactly that?\n\nThe sector with the [highest unemployment rate is IT](https://www.statista.com/statistics/217787/unemployment-rate-in-the-united-states-by-industry-and-class-of-worker/).\n\nFrom the newest [Jobs Report](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm):\n\n>Employment continued to trend up in health care, in construction, and in transportation and warehousing, **while information lost jobs**.\n\nThere are other possible explanations for this trend. There could still be a surplus of IT workers even with high demand. Tech companies over-hired.\n\nBut a completely consistent narrative that many people seem to be ignoring is that the payoff from AI investment is already happening in the form of significant efficiency gains in the IT sector.\n\nTake [Meta's recent earnings call](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/31/meta-advertising-growth-proof-that-hefty-ai-spending-is-paying-off.html).\n\n>After the company\u2019s better-than-expected\u00a0[second-quarter earnings report](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/31/meta-earnings-q2-2024.html)\u00a0on Wednesday, Zuckerberg and finance chief Susan Li rattled off all the ways that AI has helped the company grow faster than the competition in the digital advertising market, Meta\u2019s core business.\n\n\u201cThe ways that it\u2019s improving recommendations and helping people find better content, as well as making the advertising experiences more effective, I think there\u2019s a lot of upside there,\u201d Zuckerberg said on the earnings call. \u201cThose are already products that are at scale. The AI work that we\u2019re doing is going to improve that.\u201d\n\nand\n\n>Meta reported revenue growth of 22% from a year earlier to $39.07 billion, with 98% of its sales coming from advertising, primarily on Facebook and Instagram. **Its growth rate was double that of Google\u2019s ad business**\n\nNow Zuck could be full of shit, and the increase is not attributable to AI, but to other factors. Or. Or. He's correct, and Meta has already done a very good job of figuring out how to leverage AI to increase profits, even after multiple rounds of layoffs in the last few years.\n\nGotta admit, the last couple of weeks have been scary. And I'm not 100% on this thesis (I'm sure many of you will find joy in poking holes in it). But I'm still predominantly bullish on AI. Not just as a long-term play, but as a near and long term play. I've still got 2/3rds of my stocks in NVDA/AMZN/GOOG/MSFT, with a handful of calls on these stocks and META with expiries 1-2 months out.\n\nTLDR: Declining jobs numbers, especially in IT, are completely consistent with what we'd expect to see if AI investment was already starting to pay off. Bears should maybe mull this over instead of screaming 'AI BUBBLE' every fucking chance they get.",

Small/Mid caps stagnant. for the first quarter you could make bank - i made 30k through march and withdrew that shit to pay for my kids school.\n\nApril 2024: I am now a reformed bear continuing bull strategy from the first 6 weeks: S\\*P drop 5.4% through April 19 - higher than expected inflation date. Push rates higher, lower # of anticipated rate cuts.  I got hammered trying the same call strategy. Gave away 15k if not more.\n\nMay 2024: AI AI AI every time you say AI in your earnings call the price goes up $1. S&P up 5.96%\n\nJune 2024: News Report: tech doesn't even need a rate cut to continue the bull run. June 12 $AAPL says \"APPLE INTELLIGENCE\", reaches all time highs. (puts for their earnings btw). $NVDA 140% for the year? After last year we were like WTF how is this 300 a share let alone 1400 a share in June.\n\nJuly 2024 $GOOG $AMZN up \\~80-100% for the year.\n\nLook, its logical to take profits. No shame in that especially for retail who loses out 90% of the time.\n\nJuly 2024: Rate cuts like 99.999% almost certain for sept. Now suddenly Small/Mid caps rally in a massive sector rotation. $SPX/$NDX tanks. Next week:  1T outflows. Then they pump and dump the russel up 12% to 2022 highs and then sell off for a quick 6% while everyones FOMOing into $RUT. Maybe more like RUT RO!!!! I Fomo'd last of dry powder MOnday but after earnings I'm turning bearish.  Tomorrow 5k realized loss for me or hold to 0.\n\nToo hard to beat the street. Profit taking, buying million dollar real estate with cash like smart investors do. Sit on the sidelines and let it bleed. But here we are still FOMO'ing calls and short dated puts that would only print 1/1000 times.\n\nOver the past few days 3 mag 7 earnings all tanked and here we are.\n\nAMD? CPUs Good for gamers and graphics cards for poors. Pennies compared to $NVDA. $NVDA has a monopoly on AI software like $ASML has a monopoly on lithography and $TSM has a monopoly on chip production.  $TSLA obviously seemingly doomed. Google can't take your cookies anymore, advertising revenue down MoM. Wanna get cucked by the zuck?  I'm tempted to donate $1 to people wanting to buy $META calls at this point.\n\nTLDR: This looks like the same pattern we have had in 2022 and 2023 when markets take a downturn through mid-late October.   Look at the previous years. I posted last week about the last 4 septembers being red. It looks like we are in another downturn. Earnings indicates it. I don't think CPI and PCE will save us this week.\n\nI'm scrounging up 25k waiting for the correction / dip / crash and buying SHARES so i never waste so much of my lifetime just to lose money speculating with options. Will post my realized losses if you think I'm BS.\n\nThanks for reading this or just the TLDR. Looking forward to discussion!",

I think this makes a better case for momentum when it goes over $200. \n\nNo one ever made a GREAT return with a highly diversified portfolio\n\n\nArgument for downside: \n\nUnpredictable China shit.\n\nUS government interference\n\nDiversification is safer\n\nAlready  a $2T company\n\n\nOverall, I think it makes big moves within the next 5 years and will outperform S&P with minimal downside risk comparatively.  \n\nThinking of it in terms holy sheet I can retire early(< 20 yrs), outperform S&P, match S&P, match a Vanguard Target wtf ever fund, and completly boned. \n\nOh, and if/when it pops I'll reevaluate and roll into something else. Not that regarded to think great odds on 10-20x starting from $2T.  Want to here your ideas on the play.  \n\nEdit: [7/18] pull back too tempting, in on $8k worth @ $182.80.\nMay continue $8k chunk purchases weekly or so depending on what happens here.\n",

Here's why:\n\n- That fat $4 billion they yeeted at Anthropic.\n- Anthropic's Claude 3.5 is shitting all over OpenAI's stuff right now. Amazon might've backed the right horse here, and nobody's talking about it.\n- AWS is already the 800-pound gorilla in cloud. Lots of compute to leverage for AI (nobody's bigger than them).\n- Amazon's obviously got a lot of cash to snag top AI talent. \n- The whole AGI race. I wouldn't bet against Amazon pulling some Skynet-level shit out of nowhere. I'm also long the other big tech because of this thesis too, however.\n\nAnyway, as for my position, I own 500 $AMZN shares (and some LEAPs).\n\nTL;DR: $AMZN has big dick AI energy but is keeping it in their pants.

I figured I'd drop a DD post to help you all have some context around $NVDA's stock split that will go live on Monday & what has historically happened to Tech Co's after executing a stock split.\n\n**NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE.**\n\n**TL;DR - The $NVDA stock split is BEARISH given the historical performance of tech co. stock splits.**\u00a0Scroll to the bottom for positions\n\nLet's start by looking at a list of recent stock splits, how they performed over the next couple sessions:\n\nI. $AAPL 4 for 1 stock split announced on 7/30/20 (w/ earnings), went active on 8/28/20:\n\n* Performance after\u00a0**announcement**\u00a0of stock split to stock split actual date:\n   * Opened at $100.48/share on 7/31/20, closed at $122.11/share on 8/28/20 for a gain of +21.5%\n* AFTER STOCK SPLIT GOES LIVE PERFORMANCE: reference $122.11/share closing price\n   * 3-day: +5.3%\n   * 6-day: -9.6%\n   * Got to as low as $107.7/share within 1-month for a drawdown of -11.8% after stock split was announced before bouncing\n\nII. $AMZN 20 for 1 stock split announced 3/9/22, went active on 6/3/22:\n\n* AFTER STOCK SPLIT GOES LIVE PERFORMANCE: reference on 6/3/22 of $122.35/share closing price\n   * 3-day: -1.0%\n   * 6-day: -15.3%\n\nIII. $TSLA 3 for 1 stock split announced on 8/5/22, went active on 8/24/22 at close:\n\n* AFTER STOCK SPLIT GOES LIVE PERFORMANCE: reference on 8/24/22 of $297.10/share closing price\n   * 3-day: -4.1%\n   * 6-day: -6.7%\n\nIV. $NVDA 4 for 1 stock split announced on 5/21/21, went active on 7/20/21 (a rare bullish stock split):\n\n* AFTER STOCK SPLIT GOES LIVE PERFORMANCE: reference on 7/20/21 of $185.80/share closing price\n   * 3-day: +5.1%\n   * 6-day: +4.8%\n      * $NVDA actually was selling off prior to the stock split date here where it reached as high as $203.37/share before closing at the near-term bottom of $187.47/share (-7.8%) the day RIGHT before the stock split date (7/19/21)\n\nThere are many other examples like Tesla's 5 for 1 stock split on 8/28/20, $GOOG 20 for 1 stock split on 7/15/22, & others. I've compiled a database of tech company stock splits from $CSCO to $MSFT back to 1991 to obtain the following stats:\n\nAverage 3-day performance after a stock split:\u00a0***-0.8%***\n\n% of times negative 3-days:\u00a0***52.0%***\n\nAverage 6-day performance after a stock split:\u00a0***-3.4%***\n\n% of times negative 6-days:\u00a0***72.0%***\n\n*\\*\\*days measured as next 3/6 trading days, not calendar days*\n\n*---*\n\nI like my odds here on a bearish play on $NVDA following the stock split on Monday.\n\n**POSITIONS**: July 5 $1140P.

    "title": "Looking for feedback for my stock portfolio",
    "selftext": "Hi folks! I'm looking for some feedback and looking for some discussion around my current stock portfolio!\n\nI understand that most people don't out-perform the market (SP500, etc,.) over the long-term but I personally enjoy investing and want to generate some out-performance/alpha in my own individual portfolio in the long-term. In my retirement accounts (Roth IRA + 401k), I hold 100% SP500 index funds so these stocks are only held in my taxable individual account.\n\nI'm still learning a-lot and my investment philosophy is still evolving (most recently by consuming a lot of content by Warren Buffet, Charlie Munger, Chris Hohn, Dev Kantesaria, and Bill Ackman) so there's actually a good number of stocks here that I actually don't want to own anymore - but am looking at a more opportune time to sell them. \n\nMy current holdings are roughly (figures are rounded):\n\n**Amazon (AMZN) - 19%** \\- Have always liked AMZN as it's been a company with a diversified set of businesses with mostly good business models and are dominant in many of those areas. Particularly happy with the cloud business (AWS) and their ads business (from my understanding - they have an extremely strong moat and competitive advantage here they have so much data on customer's shopping habits).\n\n**ASML (ASML) - 15%** \\- Bought into this position mostly throughout the year by DCAing the dips. My view on this business is that they have a near monopoly in their space which gives them very strong pricing power (which they can leverage to increase their FCF/EPS/Net-Income even in the absence of revenue or volume growth). The stock seems to be beaten down due to risks from losing business in China (and also potential competition from them) but I'm not ***too concerned*** about this. In the worst case they become a global duopoly/oligopoly which is not too shabby.\n\n**Fidelity 500 Index Fund (FXAIX) - 11%** \\- Owned this when I initially started the portfolio.\n\n**Alphabet (GOOGL) - 10%** \\- Mostly bought into this throughout the dips in the past few years. Similar to Amazon, a very large set of diversified businesses where they're very dominant in like Youtube, Google Cloud (they compete with AWS, Azure, and OCI and they're third in the race and that's fine with me), Waymo, Ads, and Search. In the worst case, they lose their MOAT in search but from my understanding, the rest of their businesses can make up their current valuation in < 5 years. Anecdotally speaking as a developer, I still use Google search since they added AI overview since it's essentially a combination of an LLM answer + google search together. \n\n**Meta Platforms (META) - 7.5%** \\- The core of my position was from 2022 dips. They're just a cash generating machine from their balance sheet and they have a strong moat in the social media space. Not much to say about this since I bought this at around $120 - but happy to own this since Zucc is so ambitious and has done a good job at growing since IPO.\n\n**Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) - 6% -** Bought most of this position back in 2024 when it was in the $110/$120 range. Not much personally to say about this, I like the CEO and think there can be multiple winners in the GPU space.\n\n**Mastercard (MA) - 6% -** They take money off of every card transaction and have a oligopoly. Card payments are still growing globally so I'm just happy to own this. Financials look amazing! \n\n**Paypal (PYPL) - 5%** \\- I mostly bought this because it was very undervalued from a technical standpoint (i.e very high FCF yield). While their FCF/share is going to drastically increase due to their aggressive buybacks - I really do want to sell this entire position since they fundamentally aren't a business with a strong moat and pricing power. The space seems very crowded and in my own personal shopping experience - I almost always use Apple Pay when shopping on mobile and use Shop pay when purchasing online. Looking for a more opportune time to sell it though.\n\n**Canadian Pacific (CP) - 4.5%** \\- I bought this mostly due to railroads having very high barriers to entry and typically having strong moat (they have the only railway spanning USA, Canada and Mexico). This hasn't really translated to much FCF/EPS growth though and the company carries alot of debt. Looking to sell this position when it gets to a better valuation.\n\n**Fluence Energy (FLNC) - 4.3%** \\- I honestly bought into this purely based on technical analysis in 2024 - low market cap, very high revenue growth, large backlog, and enterprise backing. Currently down -55% on it and it\u2019s my only losing position. I really regret buying into this position and want to get rid of it, haven\u2019t had the stomach to just ear my losses and sell yet. Learned my lesson here to evaluate the business instead of the technicals.\n\n**Reddit (RDDT) - 3%** \\- I own this since this is a platform that I use a lot (in addition to Youtube). The financial growth seems very impressive and the business/platform is very good. I\u2019m debating on whether to buy more into it but valuation makes me slightly afraid, though it always seems like great businesses always trade at high valuations and still end up compounding long germ.\n\n**Nebius Group (NBIS) - 2%** \\- Honestly just my gamble stock.\n\n**Remaining <1% are FICO, RIVN, and SNOW.**\n\n  \nCurious to know what everyone thinks and what their feedback is!\n",

    "selftext": "Like every self-respecting Value investor, I've been looking for opportunities to divest from my tech-heavy portfolio. AI Stocks like NVDA, PLTR, MSFT, AMZN, TSLA have done great, but some of these valuations just don't make sense and I don't think now is a good time to buy into them anymore.\n\nThat brings me to look for other opportunities. I don't think there's a better opportunity right now than the Healthcare sector.\n\nHistorically, Healthcare has outperformed the S&P, thanks to relatively stable stocks like CNC.\n\nLet's take a step back. What the f\\*%# happened to this stock in the past 2 months ?\n\nThey came out and :\n\n1. Said that their Medical Loss Ratio(MLR) will be much higher because claims are getting expensive\n2. Pulled guidance for 2025\n\nSince then, they've had their Q2 Earnings call. They've revised guidance to a EPS of 1.75 for 2025 (from 7.5 previously, ouch). Given that their Q1 2025 EPS was 2.9, and their Q2 EPS was -0.16, this is pricing in a combined -1$ EPS for Q3 and Q4.\n\nThe bar is very low. Even a small sign of life from the CEO, could send this stock easily back to the 40 - 50 range, as a path to profitability is starting to be priced into the stock.\n\nThe recent headwind, albeit very impactful in the short to medium-term, is temporary. the CEO has said that they have already completed rate re-filings in the 29 states by now, and that the rate decision for each states will be expected in September. The new rates that determine the amount of premiums received, will take into account the high cost for behavioral health(therapists, psychiatric meds etc...),  home health services, and expensive drugs (Wegovy, Ozempic...) .\n\nCompared to the giant UNH, CNC has a much better reputation, isn't under DOJ Investigation, and Ambetter, their Health Insurance Marketplace, has a claims denial rate of 14%, more than half that of UNH.\n\n# Path back to profitability :\n\nCEO and the team are now laser focused on restoring profitability by pulling the necessary levers :\n\n\\- identifying and reducing areas where claims have been too \"costly\"\n\n\\- increasing premium rates, to account for the challenging environment, and with a worst case scenario in mind (continued high morbidity and utilization rate)\n\n\\- hinting at a stock buyback in the Earnings call\n\n\\- Immune from tariff BS and TACO\n\n# Possible risks\n\n\\- The trend of high morbidity and drug use continues to escalate, leading to more people needing expensive surgeries and drugs ==> unlikely, as people who fear that their benefits are being taken away with OBBBA, have already stocked up on drugs/done surgeries\n\n\\- continued political pressure on healthcare costs with bills like the OBBBA ==> unlikely, as this bill seems to be a one-and-done on healthcare, and now the Administration will focus on other more pressing matters (Russia - Ukraine conflict, Inflation, crypto, tax bills for the rich etc ...).\n\nAlso, this is speculation, but I think the full impact of the OBBBA are wayyy overstated. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that by 2034, 16 million people will lose coverage, but that's a decade away. This will be accounted for in the rate re-pricing.\n\n\\- Risks of people changing Insurers because of higher rates ==> given that every Health insurer will be increasing rates, among them: Elevance, UNH, Molina, Blue Cross Blue Shield, CNC will be no exception. People won't switch because none of the other options are better. Centene's health plan is pretty competitive, and compared to Molina health who's the most affordable, Centene's has much better coverage(available across 29 states vs 8 for Molina)\n\nOverall, I think this is a compelling buy, not just for CNC, but for the Health care sector overall, as the benefits greatly outweigh the risk at this point. Historically, the Healthcare Sector has outperformed the S&P, and this is the perfect time to buy in.",

    "title": "Absolutely everything you need to know about AMZN earnings today",
    "selftext": "Okay guys, so Amazon is set to release its Q2 earnings after the market closes today with an analyst call at 5 pm. This is gonna be a big one. Did anyone catch META yesterday? Fuck. \n\nFor Amazon, analysts expect revenue around $162 billion (up 10%) and EPS between $1.32 and $1.33, with operating income projected at $16.7 to $16.87 billion. And during this sesh, the key areas to watch will include AWS growth (estimated at $30.77 billion, up 17%), AI investments (over $100 billion capex planned), and advertising revenue (up 17% to $14.99 billion). Considering the stock performance, it's up 5% year-to-date, with bullish analyst sentiments (e.g., UBS raised price target to $271), but some valuation concerns exist (GF Value at $189.47). External factors like tariffs and Prime Day success could influence outcomes, with potential for significant stock movement based on guidance. I know that people are going to be playing AMZN earnings so I wanted to do a little write up for /r/Stocks so you guys are well informed. And I'll even post what I plan on getting at the end. \n\n**Analyst Expectations and Financial Projections**\n\nAnalysts have provided a range of estimates for Amazon's Q2 performance, showing a lot of optimism. \n\nRevenue: Expected to be around $162 billion, with variations such as $162.1 billion and $162.19 billion, representing a 9.5% to 10% year-over-year increase.  \n\nEarnings Per Share (EPS): Forecasted at $1.32 to $1.33, up from $1.26 last year, with Amazon having beaten EPS estimates for nine consecutive quarters.  \n\nOperating Income: Projected between $16.7 billion and $16.87 billion, a 13.8% to 15% increase, with an operating margin expected at 10.6% (up from 9.9% last year).  \n\nThese projections suggest strong growth, and I honestly think Amazon can exceed these figures and provide robust forward guidance. Especially given its historical \"beat and raise\" pattern, which may not suffice in the current up cycle.\n\n**Key Business Segments and Growth Drivers**\n\nAmazon's diverse operations are expected to drive its Q2 results, with several segments highlighted as critical:  \n\n1) AWS (Amazon Web Services)  \n\nAWS remains a cornerstone of Amazon's profitability, with Q1 2025 revenue up 17% to $29.3 billion. For Q2, net sales are estimated at $30.77 billion, with growth of 17% excluding foreign exchange effects. However, operating margins are expected to drop to 35% due to significant investments in AI and infrastructure, part of a $100+ billion capex plan for 2025. This segment contributed 17% of revenue and 58% of operating income last year, making it a focal point for me.\n\n2) Advertising Revenue  \n\nAdvertising is another growth engine, with Q1 2025 revenue up 18%. For Q2, it's projected to rise 17% to $14.99 billion, reflecting increased monetization of Amazon's platform as more businesses leverage its advertising ecosystem.\n\n3) Prime Membership  \n\nPrime membership grew 9% year-over-year to 220 million globally, providing a stable revenue stream through subscription fees. This growth, driven by benefits like free shipping and streaming, is expected to continue supporting Amazon's financials.\n\n4) Operational Efficiency  \n\nAmazon has improved operational efficiency, reducing fulfillment costs and increasing delivery speeds, which should enhance margins. These efforts are part of a broader strategy to balance growth investments with profitability.\n\n5) Investments in AI and Other Areas  \n\nAmazon's commitment to AI is a major theme, with a $100+ billion capital expenditure plan for 2025, primarily focused on AWS and AI services. This includes developing proprietary chips like Trainium2 and partnering with Nvidia to enhance AI capabilities. While these investments may pressure short-term margins, they position Amazon for long-term growth in the expanding AI market. Additionally, Project Kuiper, a satellite initiative, is noted as an area of rising expense, alongside e-commerce and content/advertising investments.\n\n**Analyst sentiments are generally bullish**\n\nUBS raised its price target from $249 to $271, calling Amazon the \"most coiled\" Big Tech name, implying an 18% upside and highlighting extensive investments across e-commerce, AWS, content/advertising, and Kuiper. Other analysts, including Wedbush, William Blair, and Stifel, reiterated \"outperform\" or \"buy\" ratings, with an average price target of $252.66 (range: $195 to $305). \n\n**External Factors and Market Context**\n\nSeveral external factors could influence Amazon's earnings and stock reaction:  \n\nConsider the Tariffs. Earlier this year, tariff concerns, particularly on Chinese goods, weighed on the stock, but recovery followed eased U.S. tariffs. Analysts are parsing impacts on e-commerce, with Amazon benefiting from stockpiling ahead of potential tariff hikes.\n\nAlso, think about the Prime Day Success. Held in July, Prime Day's performance could lift revenue guidance for the September-ending quarter, providing a positive signal for us.  \n\nAnd finally, with any earnings post, we need to consider macroeconomic events such as inflation, interest rates, and consumer spending trends could affect retail sales, particularly in online stores and third-party seller revenue, expected to grow 6.5% to $58.99 billion and 7% to $38.74 billion, respectively.\n\n**Potential Catalysts**\n\nI'm expecting accelerating AWS growth, better-than-expected margins, new AI announcements, and strong Q3 guidance. UBS expects upward revisions to operating profit and free-cash-flow as revenue grows, potentially more dramatic than peers.  \n\n\n**Comparisons**\n\nMicrosoft's recent Q2 results, where cloud growth was a significant driver, boosts my confidence in Amazon's cloud business, with MSFT stock jumping 4.47% in after-hours trading. This really does show how important AWS performance will be, as Amazon faces a high bar following Microsoft's strong showing.\n\n**So what to do?**\n\nAmazon's Q2 earnings are poised to be a major event, with strong growth expected across key segments like AWS, advertising, and Prime, supported by significant AI investments. This will be a great opportunity to get a call spread. For those who don't know anything about option trading, you don't need to continue reading. But for those who do, I'll be buying the 8/1 245c (@ 2.67) and selling the 252.5c (@ 1.11). This means I can get the spread for $156, with a potential max gain of 4.8x if AMZN can go up about 7.8% with earnings. Considering the stock moves on average about \u00b18% with earnings, there's a good chance it'll go up 4-8% today. \n\nNext week tho, we have a ton more earnings so I think I'll be doing a post on PLTR and AMD.",

Their net earnings per share has collapsed 50% during this time.\n\nLots of the last 2 years have been when Musk was involved with his politics. Maybe he can turn it around now, but either way, the current valuation does not leave much room for any sort of stock price appreciation. The only thing they can hope for now is to get EPS back growing positive instead of consistently negative Q/Q",

Shares of AMD were at about $127 in recent trading, making Piper's target a roughly 10% premium. \n\nThe analysts came away \"enthused\" by the firm's newly unveiled Helios server rack architecture, which it called \"pivotal\" for the growth of AMD Instinct GPUs. Helios will combine next-generation AMD MI400 chips into one larger system, the company said, and is expected in 2026. \n\nAMD highlighted its partnerships with ChatGPT maker OpenAI, Meta Platforms (META), Oracle (ORCL), Microsoft (MSFT), and others at the event. Bank of America analysts believe there\u2019s another high-profile partner announcement to come: Amazon (AMZN).\n\nAmazon Web Services (AWS) was \"a key sponsor for the event,\" BofA said. However, AWS typically uses its own events to announce new engagements, making a future reveal likely, the bank added.\n\nBofA maintained a \"buy\" rating and price target of $130 following the event. For comparison, the analyst consensus price target from Visible Alpha is about $124.",

Looking for the second day trade in this- we saw TSLA go to a low of $275 yesterday, so I'm interested to see if we continue selling off or make at least some attempt at recovery. Trump/Musk are expected to speak today to \"cool things down\". This spat is mainly political, another issue to add along with the rest. Musk did threaten to stop work on the Dragon Capsule, Trump threatened to stop all of TSLA/SpaceX's government contracts, causing the stock to fall 50 points throughout the day.\n\n[**VERA (Vera)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=VERA&p=d)\\- VERA fell 30% after competitor Otsuka reported superior Phase 3 trial results for its IgA nephropathy drug, sibeprenlimab, which achieved a 51.2% reduction in proteinuria compared to Vera's atacicept's 46% reduction. We had seen VERA actually spike up due to their drug report a few days back from $20 ->$37 on this news- it's possible that it'll just stay flat at pre-drug release price.\n\n[**CRCL (Circle)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=CRCL&p=d)\\- Watching the $100 level for potential breakout or breakdown. I regret not writing a DD for this but I was taking a break. We opened at \\~2.5x multiple to the original IPO price and surged past $100 briefly in the first few minutes of trading, we've stayed pretty strong/sustained up since then. I'm interested to see if we can stay fairly at this level. I'm mainly interested in this because CRCL is one of the first listed stable C's on a US listing, and we've seen HUGE interest in recent catalysts that are related to this space/industry.\n\n[**ASTS (AST SpaceMobile)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=ASTS&p=d)\\- ASTS surged over 13% amid speculation of a potential partnership or investment from Amazon, following social media posts featuring AST's CEO and Jeff Bezos. AMZN is beginning commercialization of its Project Kuiper initiative, a satellite-based project that will deliver retail wireless broadband to Earth (competitor to Starlink). There was a research report released that speculates ASTS's RF wireless service could complement Kuiper's broadband technology, and therefore make sense for an acquisition by AMZN. Regardless of how plausible you think an acquisition this is, this was driven all by a single picture and speculation. So be careful of volatility if nothing happens.",

Everything in consumer disc is moving off this news. Risks I'm seeing from this are potential re-escalation of trade tensions and more supply chain disruptions, and I'm thinking of possibly flipping short if we make a massive move upwards.\n\n[**BABA (Alibaba)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=BABA&p=d) **/** [**JD (JD.com)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=JD&p=d)\\- Chinese tech stocks like BABA and JD are also major winners of tariffs, with both up roughly 6%, following the 90-day agreement.

This policy aims to \"align\" U.S. drug prices with the lower prices paid by other countries. Obviously pretty terrible news for anyone investing in pharmaceutical stocks because it affects major revenue sources for this company. The US has limited direct negotiating and mainly relies on private pharmacy benefit managers to negotiate prices in insurance plans currently, which results in sky-high insurance costs. I'm Interested in MRK, we're already broken lows (even during the tariffs) because MRK is highly dependent on Medicare reimbursement (MRK).\n\n[**BP (BP)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=BP&p=d)\\- BP up on reports that several major oil companies, including Shell, Chevron, and ExxonMobil, are evaluating potential takeover bids.

I\u2019ve been buying the tariff dip on margin, with $1.4 million invested in blue chip stocks. I\u2019m up 46% in the past month. My largest buys have been in TSM, NVDA, ORCL, CAVA, AMZN, MSFT, META & SMH.\n\n1. Largest tax cut in history is coming. Republicans own the house and senate, and Trump is deadset on cutting taxes by $5 trillion. Obviously not good for the national debt but that will juice the economy big time. \n\n2. Midterms are coming in 2026, and Trump will not want to have a recession on his hands which would risk him loosing the house and senate. I am fully convinced he launched this tariff war so early on, so he could get it over with before midterms. Trump has pivoted extremely quickly on all reciprocal tariffs aside from china. And he is desperate to start negotiations with china. China and the U.S have both entered a de escalatatory tone, with both sides  making exemptions to tariffs, china expressing willingness to deal with fentanyl, and acknowledging the desire to negotiate- along side acknowledging that the U.S has reached out to them. They are BOTH eager to water down these tariffs and deep down, when both parties want the same thing (reduced tariffs) they will find a way to get it despite all the public bluster. Even if a deal could take months, they will likely have a pause either during or before negotiations. \n\n\n3. Rate cuts are coming later this year. It\u2019s likely there will be at least 2 rate cuts before year\u2019s end assuming tariff inflation does not cause extreme inflation. Rate cuts will boost the ability to borrow capital, increase liquidity and stimulating the economy. \n\n4. We are at the dawn of the largest productivity revolution in history. Everyone has seemed to forget about AI despite big tech earnings and guidance blowing it out of the park. MSFT, GOOG, and META are printing money, and AI is showing incredible returns in the semiconductor and data center space. We are still in the early stages of AI, the smarter it gets the more productivity will increase. \n\n5. The economy is currently strong. Jobs numbers in April (not a lagging indicator) were impressive. At the end of the day, so long as people are not losing their jobs the U.S consumer will stay resilient. Tariff effects could disrupt that if they stay in effect long term. However I think it\u2019s pretty obvious the worst of the tariffs are temporary. \n\n6. U.S exceptionalism is nowhere close to ending. We are miles ahead of every other economy in terms of innovation and technology. We lead in services, and nobody is boycotting GOOG, META, MSFT etc in a significant way. These innovative tech companies exist nowhere else in scale and success. Our consumer is 30% of the global economy and nowhere do they have such a wealthy large pool of consumers. We are still the world reserve currency with 59% of currency held abroad is dollars. And nobody, even Trump will let us lose that reserve currency status.",

As most of you know, Musk's political involvement has made him controversial, and by extension, TSLA as well.\n\n[**RBLX (Roblox)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=RBLX&p=d)\\- Reported Q1 results with a loss of $0.32 per share vs. $0.40 expected and bookings of $1.21B vs. $1.14B expected. Raised 2025 bookings guidance to $5.285B\u2013$5.36B, above analyst consensus of $5.27B. Interested in $74 level, other than that not too interested in the stock. No new risks beyond whatever has been said before (slower user growth, regulatory risks, platform outages, problems with minors, etc). Buy your kids some Robux!\n\n[**MSFT (Microsoft)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=MSFT&p=d)\\- EPS of $3.46 vs. $3.22 expected and revenue of $70.07B vs. $68.42B expected. Capex surged to $16.75B, up 53% YoY, as it ramps up AI infrastructure, noting expected AI capacity constraints beyond June. Interested in seeing if it holds above $430 at market open. Its outsized AI investment was of huge interest to me- this moved a lot of Mag 7 names higher, especially NVDA. It signaled that there's still room for growth for these chip-makers. Companies that rent out computing space such as CRWV also moved higher on this as well. (It signals that they'll do better on earnings). \n\n[**META (Meta)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=META&p=d)\\- Reported stronger-than-expected Q1 revenue; Q2 sales guided to $42.5B\u2013$45.5B. Increased 2025 capex forecast to $64B\u2013$72B, citing heightened infrastructure and AI investments. Also a huge mover, interested in it if it breaks the $600 level. Heavy AI spending along with digital ad rebound trends pushed semis upward, they stated their sector focus remains on monetization of AI-driven engagement tools.\n\n  \nEarnings: Tim AAPL AMZN, AMGN ",

    "selftext": "This is probably an extremely tired topic, but wanted some advice, or at least some personal stories from people who have had experience in the market.\n\nWhen the 2020 pandemic crash happened, I was 21 and had some money, so I started looking into investing. I was a complete rookie and an idiot, thinking that I was good at choosing companies when it was just a ridiculous bull market, and after coming out on a small plus side, I let go of the market for a very long time.\n\nIn February of this year, my father suddenly passed away. As we were going through his accounts and our family assets, we realized he was quite good with money, and alongside his monthly pension that will be given to my mother, we learned that we were going to be well off. After careful calculation, my mother decided to keep the pension, and one third of my father's assets. I was given around two thirds of the assets, which came out to roughly 280,000$.\n\nI'm from Korea, and for my entire life, always dreamed of moving to the States for a high paying job, but never had the money to get the education in order to do so. Now I do.\n\nAfter crunching the numbers, I've decided to put aside 80,000$ to pay for my living costs, tuition costs to prepare for my education in the States, and for some traveling. This will keep me fairly comfortable until the end of 2028. Which leaves 200,000$ for me to invest in, in order to build up my net worth for my time studying in America, before finally getting a job.\n\nThen Trump announced the tariffs, and I started to reconsider everything.\n\nThankfully, I was mostly cash when the market went down, and afterwards I had invested  up to 50,000$ back into the market. Mostly focusing on either dividend heavy companies or ETF's like VOO, SCHD, KO, PEPCO, and powerhouse tech companies like NVDA, AMZN, MSFT, and other sectors, as well as companies in other countries.\n\nMy issue now is whether to wait for the doom mindset that so many people seem to have about the current US administration and the market to take full effect and tank everything, or do I just DCA into the company roster that I made for the next few months, and just let the market do its thing for the next 3 to 4 years. I know that timing the market is stupid, and even if you time it perfectly, it's so stressful anyways. I kinda just want to invest and not think about it constantly.\n\nI woud love to hear your long-term investing stories to settle my mind. Been very anxious about all of this in the last month or so.",

Never trust the Reddit mob.\n\n\n\u201cTariffs will be negotiated away. Buy as much stocks as possible!\n\nEveryone here is panicking and thinking these tariffs are going to destroy everything. It\u2019s not an incorrect thought\u2026 IF they stay in effect for a long period. \n\nHowever it\u2019s important to listen to what Trump has said. Trump said he\u2019s open to tarrif cuts if countries offer something phenomenal. He also said now these countries will be coming to us to negotiate rather than the other way around. He used tik tok as an example to say he may cut tarrif on china to close a tik tok deal. \n\nTrump put these tariffs in effect to give him huge leverage over every country. He even bragged that every country has called him to negotiate. Acting tough like the tariffs will be in place for a few years, is ONLY to increase their leverage. The more difficult it seems to remove tariffs the more negotiating power Trump has. \n\nThis is a rare stock crash where it\u2019s completely self inflicted with the signing of a pen from the president. This means to end this pain will ONLY take the president to end the tariffs- which can be done instantly. \n\nI am very sure this will be exactly like the Covid crash. He will keep talking a big talk and more and more terrible news will come out. But then there will be cracks as exceptions are made and deals are negotiated. This is literally the man who wrote \u201cArt of the Deal\u201d. He is 100% transactional and is always aiming to make a deal.\n\nPersonally I am buying AI stocks like crazy.

([AMZN](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMZN)) has canceled orders for multiple products made in China and other Asian countries, according to a document reviewed by Bloomberg and people familiar with the matter, suggesting the company is reducing its exposure to tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump.\n\nThe orders for beach chairs, scooters, air conditioners and other merchandise from multiple Amazon vendors were halted after Trump\u2019s April 2 announcement that he planned to levy tariffs on more than 180 countries and territories, including China, Vietnam and Thailand, the people said. The timing of the cancellations, which had no warning, led the vendors to suspect it was a response to tariffs.\n\nAn Amazon spokesperson declined to comment. The company identified international trade disputes as a risk factor in its annual report released in February. \u201cChina-based suppliers provide significant portions of our components and finished goods,\u201d the company said.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how widespread the cancellations are and how many types of merchandise they affect.\n\nOne vendor who has been selling beach chairs made in China to Amazon for more than a decade received an email from the company last week that said it was canceling some purchase orders it placed \u201cin error\u201c and instructed the vendor not to ship them. The email, which was reviewed by Bloomberg, didn\u2019t mention tariffs.\n\nThe vendor said the $500,000 wholesale order was nixed after the chairs had already been manufactured, leaving this person on the hook to pay the factory and find other buyers. The vendor, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation from Amazon, said the company had never canceled one of its orders in such as manner.\n\nScott Miller, a former Amazon vendor manager who now works as an e-commerce consultant, said Amazon canceled orders for merchandise made in China and other Asian countries from several of his clients. The cancellations came without warning, he said, and could force vendors to renegotiate terms with the e-commerce company.\n\n\u201cAmazon really holds all of the cards,\u201d said Miller, founder and CEO of pdPlus in Minneapolis. \u201cThe only real recourse vendors have is to either sell this inventory in other countries at lower margins or try to work with other retailers.\u201d\n\nThe beach chair vendor and Miller said Amazon cancelled \u201cdirect import orders,\u201d a process in which Amazon buys inventory wholesale in the country in which it is made and ships the products to its warehouses in the United States. Amazon serves as the importer of record for the orders, which means it pays tariffs when the products reach US ports.\n\nAmazon has been importing items this way for years as a way to reduce costs since Amazon can often use bulk shipping rates to import items at lower costs than vendors. Canceling those orders puts the tariff exposure back on vendors if they import merchandise to the US by other means.\n\nItems Amazon buys directly from vendors account for about 40% of the products sold on its website. The rest of the company\u2019s sales are made by independent merchants who essentially rent digital shelf space from Amazon, paying the company commissions and fees for logistics and advertising.\n\nTrump\u2019s tariffs have rattled global markets. Many businesses are raising prices, stoking fears of a recession. On Tuesday, Robert W. Baird & Co. Inc. reduced its 2025 revenue forecast for Amazon, citing the effects of tariffs in a research note. The company\u2019s shares have fallen about 21% this year, compared with the S&P 500\u2019s 15% slump.",

It\u2019s not an incorrect thought\u2026 IF they stay in effect for a long period. \n\nHowever it\u2019s important to listen to what Trump has said. Trump said he\u2019s open to tarrif cuts if countries offer something phenomenal. He also said now these countries will be coming to us to negotiate rather than the other way around. He used tik tok as an example to say he may cut tarrif on china to close a tik tok deal. \n\nTrump put these tariffs in effect to give him huge leverage over every country. He even bragged that every country has called him to negotiate. Acting tough like the tariffs will be in place for a few years, is ONLY to increase their leverage. The more difficult it seems to remove tariffs the more negotiating power Trump has. \n\nThis is a rare stock crash where it\u2019s completely self inflicted with the signing of a pen from the president. This means to end this pain will ONLY take the president to end the tariffs- which can be done instantly. \n\nI am very sure this will be exactly like the Covid crash.

The largest risk, according to analysts, centers on the iPhone maker's overseas production hubs, which are particularly vulnerable to the tariffed countries.\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump announced tariffs that will impact some 185 countries, including the United States's largest trading partners. Additional reciprocal tariffs, for instance, will include 34% tariffs on Chinese imports, a 20% tariff on European Union imports, a 46% tariff on imports from Vietnam, 32% on imports from Taiwan, and 26% on India \u2014 all set to take effect on April 9.\n\nNotably, the additional 34% tax on China will be added to the country's existing 20% tariff, meaning its total tariff rate will rise to 54%. China is Apple's most important\u00a0[production hub](https://www.businessinsider.com/tim-cook-apple-supply-chain-trump-tariffs-china-diversify-iphone-2025-1?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=yahoo.com), with about 85% of its iPhones manufactured there.\n\n\"Apple produces basically all their iPhones in China, and the question will be around exceptions and exemptions on this tariff policy if those companies are building more operations, factories, and plants in the US[\u00a0like Apple announced in February](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/02/apple-will-spend-more-than-500-billion-usd-in-the-us-over-the-next-four-years/),\" Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said in a note to clients following the announcement.\n\nAs trade tensions escalate, Apple has moved to increase its supply chain beyond just China, boosting manufacturing in places like India and Vietnam. But with the new tariff announcements set to impact those countries too, there's now limited room for reprieve.\n\n\"The worry will be around pricing and margin impacts along with what this means for the global supply chain looking forward,\" Ives said. For now, the analyst continues to believe major negotiations will happen over the coming months as companies attempt to navigate \"this new world of tariffs.\"\n\nUntil then, he warned, \"tech stocks will clearly be under major pressure.\"\n\nOther Magnificent Seven players also faced significant selling action. In aggregate, that cohort of stocks is currently on track to eliminate over $800 billion from their collective market caps.\n\nIn afternoon trade, Amazon ([AMZN](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMZN)) and Nvidia ([NVDA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NVDA)) each fell 7%, followed by a 6% drop in both Alphabet ([GOOGL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOGL)) and Tesla ([TSLA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA)). Meta ([META](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/META)) dipped 3%, while Microsoft ([MSFT](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MSFT)) was off just under 2%.\n\nOutside of the Mag Seven, chip stocks faced similar declines, despite the exemption of semiconductors from Trump's additional tariffs. Nvidia competitor Broadcom ([AVGO](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AVGO)), for example, erased well over $50 billion from its market cap following an 8% drop in shares.\n\n\"The implications \\[of the announced tariffs\\] are broad-reaching, and we see negative implications for the whole \\[chip\\] sector,\" KeyBanc analyst John Vinh wrote in a note to clients. \"These are most notably going to negatively impact end-demand in key markets including smartphones/iPhones and PCs, as a significant amount of manufacturing is done within China.\"\n\nStacy Rasgon, Bernstein's managing director and senior analyst, added in an interview with Yahoo Finance that the biggest headwind for semiconductors is not necessarily the direct impact of tariffs. Rather, it's the risk of demand destruction as these products become more expensive.\n\nHe added, \"The other risk for semis is that they are very cyclical, very global, and very correlated to the macro and to GDP.\u00a0[So if this tips us into recession,\u00a0](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/us-economy-dangerously-vulnerable-to-recession-wall-street-reacts-to-tariff-fallout-155837444.html)that's probably not going to be great.\"",

    "title": "CoreWeave, the biggest IPO of 2025. (DD on $CRWV)",
    "selftext": "# I love IPOs.\n\nThe last IPO I thought was amazing was ARM (and how far we've come!).  Coreweave (IPOing on the 28th!) is another one I think has a ton of potential. (I wrote the majority of this before the reduced IPO sizing so please forgive me if my math is incorrect).\n\nCoreWeave is a cloud infrastructure provider specializing in GPU computing, called an \u201cAI hyperscaler.\u201d They run data centers full of GPUs and rent out that computing power to customers via the cloud. Similar to AWS/Azure, but they're focused on AI/ML/GPU tasks like making stupid Studio Ghibli pictures of yourself.\n\nCRWV started in 2017 mining ETH but pivoted to being a GPU farm in 2019 after the crash. By 2022, they fully exited crypto mining and doubled down on enterprise GPU cloud services\u200b. This early mover advantage in GPU hosting, (along with all the GPUs they bought from NVDA), have made it a player in the the cloud services space.\n\nCRWV makes money by charging for usage-based cloud compute - clients pay for GPU hours on their servers.\u200b Initially, they served niches like VFX studios (movies like Interstellar take millions of GPU hours to render), but now AI training and inference workloads are the main growth driver\u200b.\n\nCompanies like META/IBM/MSFT have used CRWV for AI compute needs in the past\u200b. CRWV's differentiator is through software- they claim custom scheduling software (e.g. a system called \u201cSUNK\u201d and an optimizer \u201cTensorizer\u201d) that yields better hardware utilization, faster container spin-ups, and higher throughput than general-purpose which makes them more efficient to use.\n\nIn practice, that means a customer training a large ML model might get results faster or cheaper on CRWV than on AWS. CRWV currently operates 32 data centers with 250k+ NVDA GPUs and are very aggressive in acquiring them- they deploy A100, H100, and H200s and are prioritized as customers of NVDA.\n\n**The NVDA Relationship**\n\nNVDA backs CRWV, and they're strong partners (which means they prioritize each other over other customers). Due to this, I dismiss the possibility that CRWV will ever have troubles on the supply side of obtaining GPUs. Something that is fairly common knowledge is that NVDA (and other companies) prefer selling GPUs in bulk because it simplifies customer service and they can charge for enterprise support and  sell thousands at a time. It's also why NVDA spits on the face of their gaming customers.\n\n**Isn't it kind of shady that NVDA both invests and is a customer of CRWV? Why doesn't NVDA use their own chips instead of renting capacity from CRWV?**\n\nKind of. Nothing they've done is outright illegal (even using their GPUs as collateral is within the law). Even companies that build GPUs need to rent compute when there's a massive amount of demand. MSFT did it, NVDA did it, OpenAI WILL do it. CRWV signed a direct deal with OpenAI: a multi-year commitment up to $11.9\u202fB for GPU cloud capacity\u200b. They have ties to the major AI players. This entire DD going forward assumes that they will continue to keep their relationship with NVDA because NVDA needs them so AWS doesn't swallow the entire market. \n\n**The Financials**\n\nCRWV has had ridiculous growth- In 2022, they had revenue of $15.8\u202fM (the majority of which came from ETH mining). In 2023, their GPU computing pivot led to revenue of $229M, then $1.9B in 2024. This was obviously fueled by the release of ChatGPT as demand for GPU compute exploded as other companies scrambled to compete with their OWN LLM models.\n\nBy 2024, CRWV neared $2\u202fB in annual sales, transforming from a niche player to a major cloud provider in two years.\n\nThe financial issue is that CRWV is unprofitable as it scales. In 2023, it lost \\~$600M, and in 2024m \\~$860M. For every $1 of revenue in 2024, they spent about $1.45 for huge investments in data centers, GPUs, and the associated operating costs (plus interest on debt they've taken out which they have a ton of).\n\nThe S-1 shows operating costs close to \\~$1B from tech/infra in 2024, which includes data center space, buying/depreciating their GPUs, electricity costs, maintenance staff, etc. The capex is massive and is funded largely by debt.\n\nThe cash burn is brutal as well- at the end of 2024 CRWV still has negative FCF (which is normal for a pre-ipo high growth tech startup) and is betting that they will eventually claw their way to profitability despite the brutal looking financials (like Uber, Snowflake, Robinhood, insert your choice of tech startup here lol). The bet is that high upfront investment now will secure long-term contracts and scale to profitability later, like most tech IPOs.\n\n**Customer Concentration**\n\nIn 2023, Microsoft accounted for \\~35% of CRWV\u2019s revenue\u200b. In 2024, that grew to \\~62% of total revenue\u200b. Their S-1 mentioned that close to \\~80% of their revenue comes from two customers alone. But this is a warning sign because MSFT wants to build their own (hence their announcement of spending \\~$80B in 2025 for AI data centers).\n\n**If MSFT scales back their use of CRWV then they are frankly fucked.** MSFT's CEO also mentioned that using external capacity (like CRWV) for GPUs was a short-term stopgap until their own investment in Azure pays off.\n\nHowever, the OpenAI deal (remember that OpenAI is 49% owned by MSFT) could take the place of MSFT going forward. The contract is up to $11.9B through 2030\u200b, which averages out to \\~$2B/year if used, which is equivalent to all of CRWV's 2024 revenue.  If OpenAI maximizes their usage, CRWV\u2019s revenue could potentially double at minimum if MSFT doesn't pull out. This is a wild hopium optimistic case but I thought it was worth mentioning.\n\nBeyond those two, CRWV has other customers that make up the \\~20% of 2024 revenue). These include research labs, VFX studios, and other tech companies but none are individually as large compared to the MSFT/OpenAI. What will make or break this company in the long run is the diversification of the client base because all their eggs are in one basket.\n\n**IPO Technicals**\n\nCRWV sold 37.5M shares at $40/share, getting $1.5B and giving it a $20B valuation. That was below CRWV's official target of offering 49M shares at $47-$55, raising up to $2.7B at $32B valuation\u200b. This signals a lack of interest in the initial offering and is not great news if you already hold the stock, but is excellent if you're a short term trader that wants to see a pop on IPO day- the stock has more room to run. Yes, this means it's good for retail, bad for insiders.\n\n**Valuation/Comparables**\n\nIs a \\~$20B valuation reasonable for CRWV? You can do a rough comparison:\n\n|**Company**|Annual Revenue (2024)|**Recent Valuation**|**EV/Revenue Multiple**|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|**CoreWeave** (CRWV)|$1.92\u202fB|\\~$20B (target IPO)|\\~10\u00d7|\n|**Snowflake** (SNOW)|$3.41\u202fB\u200b|\\~$52\u202fB (market cap)|\\~15\u00d7 \u200b|\n|**Databricks**\\*|\\~$3\u202fB by end of 2025|\\~$62\u202fB \u200b|\\~20\u00d7|\n|**AWS** (AMZN)|$107.6\u202fB\u200b|\\~$500\u202fB|\\~4-5\u00d7|\n\n(That's not a typo- AWS is valued at \\~$500B, it's the main driver of AMZN's growth, yet struggles to grow because it's already massive). \\*Also note that Databricks is a private company\n\nI think that if the company can maintain a hyper-growth trajectory (e.g. 2-3\u00d7 growth for a couple more years), then an 10\u00d7 multiple now could look cheap in hindsight. For instance, 2025 revenue could hit \\~$4\u202fB+ with the OpenAI ramp and other clients. Of course, we have risks like growth decelerating, and tariffs and Trump and China that could come in and decimate growth. And of course, they're not profitable (for now). Ironically, CRWV and other US firms would BENEFIT from chip restrictions because they'd be prioritized over the overseas ones that use NVDA chips.\n\nCRWV\u2019s valuation is aggressive (dare I say fair for a hyperscaler), but in line  with other cloud providers. The entire short term bull thesis depends on them retaining MSFT as a customer and also keeping OpenAI- if that occurs then investing in it now looks like a no-brainer. If not, **it's completely possible we see an 50%+ selloff. I think that's the reason why we're seeing such hesitancy in this valuation.**\n\nThis valuation is also dependent on entirely dependent on AI spending GROWING, society seeing greater integration in AI (more than we have now), and AI firms willing to continue spending on compute they can't harness themselves. We are still supply constrained on GPUs in general, and if we ever experience NVDA building more GPUs than there is demand for, then Coreweave's margins are threatened and profitability can vanish. For now, it looks like that is unlikely to happen.\n\n**IPO Trading Details**\n\n37.5M shares is decent IPO volume so I don't expect this to be illiquid when it trades. The main things I watch for are indication price (whether there are people who want to buy the print of the stock higher than what we IPO at) and share paired (which somewhat signal when the IPO will open for trading).\n\nOverall, this is a pure AI play on GPU compute, a bet that demand for GPUs will continue to outstrip supply,  and that MSFT/OpenAI/every other tech firm involved won't slit their throat in in the eternal game of thrones that is capitalism.\n\n**TL;DR:** There's a hell of a lot of risk, but I like the stock. It's completely possible it could open and sell off because the insiders just want to bail. It's possible that it skyrockets. Anything is possible in the wild and crazy world of IPO trading.\n\nSource:\n\n[Majority of it came from S-1 on the SEC site](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1769628/000119312525044231/d899798ds1.htm), the rest from other random tech sites and background knowledge of cloud hyperscalers.",

With the recent gains, the Dow has inched back into positive territory for 2025, as stocks have rebounded from a month-long selloff spurred by concerns about the potential impact of tariffs and uncertainty about the outlook for the economy.\n\nInvestors brushed off consumer confidence data released this morning that came in weaker than expected, with the index hitting its lowest level in more than four years. Investors are closing watching all data points amid worries that tariffs could reignite inflation and cause economic growth to stall. The big economic report of the week comes Friday with the scheduled release of the Federal Reserve's preferred measure of inflation.\n\nThe yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which had fallen during the recent stock market rout amid the growing concerns about the economy, was at 4.32% in late trading, down from 4.33% at yesterday's close and from an earlier high Tuesday of 4.37%. The yield, which affects costs on all sorts of loans, notably mortgages, hit its highest level in more than a month this morning.\n\nMega-cap technology stocks, which helped lead Monday's rally, were mostly higher again today. Shares of Tesla (TSLA) rallied late in the day to finish 3.5% higher, gaining ground for the 5th consecutive session, despite news Tuesday that the EV maker's sales in Europe continued to slide. Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN) and Meta Platforms (META) each rose more than 1%, while Microsoft (MSFT) inched ahead. Chipmakers Nvidia (NVDA) and Broadcom (AVGO) closed slightly lower\n\n\n\nhttps://www.investopedia.com/dow-jones-today-03252025-11702763",

That is still remarkable growth for a market leader with two other 800-pound Gorillas, Alphabet and Microsoft, chasing it.

    "selftext": "Short sellers have been cleaning up to start 2025 amid a massive sell-off in some of the market's most popular names over the past two years.\n\nShort sellers have made a combined $15 billion betting against Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA) stock thus far this year, according to data from S3 Partners. Tesla shorts alone have raked in nearly $11 billion, while bets against Nvidia have brought in more than $4 billion.\n\nTesla's 40% year-to-date drop has led the declines of the so-called Magnificent Seven stocks. Investors have grown concerned about CEO Elon Musk's focus on government efficiency efforts and how his role with President Trump's administration could be a turnoff to the electric vehicle maker's customer base.\n\nBut it hasn't just been Tesla lagging. As an index, the Magnificent Seven \u2014 which also includes Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), and Meta (META) \u2014 is underperforming the S&P 500 this quarter by the most since 2022.\n\nShort sellers have profited off of all of the names in the cohort this year. They've brought in nearly $5 billion betting against Apple stock, which is down nearly 14% in 2025.\n\nThe crash in the most popular trade of the past two years comes as investors have been re-rating their growth expectations. Fears of slowing economic growth and the impact of Trump's tariff policies have weighed on markets. Meanwhile, Big Tech has faced growing investor criticism about its ballooning AI spend and whether or not it will eventually boost future profits as much as Wall Street hopes. The year also included a massive drawdown in some large tech names, including Nvidia, following the release of a cheaper AI model from Chinese company DeepSeek.\n\nNow, with most of the names sitting around 20% off their recent 52-week highs, the looming question for markets is whether or not investor appetite for the stocks that led the market higher for the past two years will return.\n\n\"Maybe these tech stocks got ahead of their skis a little bit,\" BMO Capital Markets chief investment strategist Brian Belski told Yahoo Finance last week. \"But at the end of the day, these are monster companies that define the growth trajectory for the United States stock market. They are not going away.\"\n\n[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/short-sellers-have-made-15-billion-betting-against-tesla-and-nvidia-in-2025-164652312.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/short-sellers-have-made-15-billion-betting-against-tesla-and-nvidia-in-2025-164652312.html)",

    "selftext": "Trump\u2019s latest trade policies are hammering the markets\u2014S&P 500 down \\~9%, Nasdaq off \\~12%\u2014and it looks like he\u2019s doubling down. Tariffs on China, Canada, Mexico, and the EU are back on the table, with zero indication that he\u2019s backing down. While some sectors (steel, domestic manufacturing) stand to benefit, others (tech, autos, multinational retailers) are getting crushed. The question is: at what point does the market pain force Trump to change course?\n\nThe **2025 Trade Policy Agenda** lays out his vision:\n\n\u2705 **Tariffs as leverage** \u2013 forcing trade partners into more \u201creciprocal\u201d deals\n\n\u2705 **USMCA review (2026)** \u2013 questioning whether Canada & Mexico are benefiting unfairly\n\n\u2705 **Hardline stance on China** \u2013 blaming it for the U.S. trade deficit and pushing for stricter enforcement of trade agreements\n\nHis strategy? **Drive U.S. production up, cut reliance on imports, and force foreign partners to play by his rules.** But markets are worried about **inflation, supply chain disruption, and retaliatory tariffs**\u2014all of which are starting to bite.\n\nNot every company is hurting\u2014some stand to **benefit significantly** from Trump\u2019s protectionist approach. Trump\u2019s tariffs **shield domestic manufacturers from foreign competition**, making U.S. steel, aluminum, and energy companies prime beneficiaries. E.g \n\n* **U.S. Steel** X 25% steel tariffs will boost profits\n* **Cleveland-Cliffs** CLF Increased demand for domestic steel\n* **Nucor** NUE Largest U.S. steel producer, stronger pricing power\n* **Anheuser-Busch** BUD Domestic production = insulated from trade costs\n* **Prologis** PLD Companies stockpiling goods = warehouse demand surge\n* **Lockheed Martin** LMT Defense spending likely to rise under Trump\n* **Marathon Petroleum** MPC Energy independence push favors domestic refiners\n\nCompanies with **complex supply chains** and reliance on **overseas production** are getting squeezed by **higher input costs and potential retaliatory tariffs**.E.g\n\n* **Apple** AAPL Major China exposure, supply chain at risk\n* **Tesla** TSLA Higher costs across supply chain, could hurt margins\n* **General Motors** GM Tariffs on parts increase manufacturing costs\n* **Ford** F Supply chain disruptions could impact production\n* **Nike** NKE Manufacturing in China = higher import costs\n* **Amazon** AMZN Increased cost of goods from global suppliers\n* **Boeing** BA Risk of Chinese retaliation cutting aircraft orders \n\nAre you positioning for a **domestic manufacturing boom**, or do you think **this trade war will spiral into a full-blown recession**? Should we be **buying the dip** in industrials or **shorting overexposed multinationals**?\n\n  \nTrump\u2019s strategy is clear: use **tariffs as a multipurpose weapon**, not just for trade but also for **immigration and national security**. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick hinted that **Canada & Mexico could avoid tariffs if they \u201cimprove border security\u201d and crack down on fentanyl trafficking**. This suggests Trump is **negotiating in multiple arenas at once**, using economic pressure to force compliance on broader policy goals.\n\nThe problem? **Markets hate uncertainty**, and businesses can\u2019t plan if policy keeps shifting based on unrelated factors. While some U.S. industries benefit, long-term uncertainty could hurt investment, expansion, and consumer confidence.",

Announces that profit could fall by $2B or more due to tariffs and lower EV demand.\n\n**Technicals:** Pretty much broke the $10 level it's been trading around since August, watching to see if it'll sell off more by the open. Highly/infinitely liquid.\n\n**Catalyst/Sector Context:** The entire automotive industry is challenged by tariffs. F guided lower for 2025.\n\n**Risks:** Obviously these are one of the bigger movers from Mexico tariffs (most cars are assembled in Mexico then shipped to the US).\n\n**Related Tickers:** GM, TSLA, STLA.\n\n**Offhand Comments:** Ford's outlook reflects the broader industry's apprehension about geopolitical factors affecting operations and profitability. Interesting to see how other car companies react to earnings as well.\n\n**Ticker:** [**ARM (Arm Holdings)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=ARM&p=d)\n\n**Catalyst:** ARM reported EPS of $0.39 vs. $0.34 expected. Revenue of $983 million vs. $959M expected. Buoyed by Deepseek ban news, most likely as well.\n\n**Technicals:** Was down roughly 8% after earnings, but seems to be somewhat recovering after Deepseek news.\n\n**Catalyst/Sector Context:** Semiconductor sector is experiencing heightened demand, especially after PLTR's comments that the AI train will never stop. We're seeing growth in data center applications, the main driver of semis purchases.\n\n**Risks:** Despite strong performance, Arm's lowered full-year revenue forecast has led to a 6% drop in its shares.\n\n**Related Tickers:** NVDA, AMD, INTC.\n\n**Ticker:** [**RBLX (Roblox Corporation)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=RBLX&p=d)\n\n**Catalyst:** Roblox Corporation reported earnings with an EPS of -$0.33 vs. -$0.46 expected. Revenue of $988.2M vs. $967.2M expected.\n\n**Technicals:** $50 is the clear level here, note that earnings were released premarket rather than aftermarket yesterday. Seems to be a massive overreaction selloff (but has recovered somewhat).\n\n**Risks:** IIRC Roblox isn't profitable yet- they're focusing on growth/revenue over profits, but most of their costs are outside their control (platform fees like the Apple store, developers, infrastructure for trust/safety for minors).\n\n**Related Tickers:** EA, TTWO.\n\n**Ticker:** [**NVDA (NVIDIA Corporation)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&p=d)\n\n**Catalyst:** DeepSeek, a Chinese AI start-up, has temporarily suspended its API service top-ups due to server resource constraints. Additionally, U.S. lawmakers plan to introduce a bill to ban DeepSeek's chatbot application from government-owned devices over data security concerns.\n\n**Catalyst/Sector Context:** The AI industry is under increased scrutiny regarding data security and geopolitical tensions but that's grown more laissez-faire under Trump. DeepSeek's service suspension and potential U.S. government ban helps American chip makers and NVDA especially, due to their continued dominance.\n\n**Risks:** Deepseek getting banned will likely lead to greater reliance on American AI chatbots, spurring growth in American semis manufacturers.\n\n**Related Tickers:** AMD, INTC, QCOM.\n\n**Offhand Comments:** (I am currently long).\n\n**Ticker:** [**SWKS (Skyworks Solutions)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SWKS&p=d)\n\n**Catalyst:** EPS of $1.60 vs. $1.57 expected.

If we get closer I'm interested in some small bounce depending on volume/size of the move.\n\n**Catalyst/Sector Context:** SWKS supplies some of the chips for Apple's iPhone, and their iPhone sales haven't done too well recently- thus this has a knock-on effect by affecting SWKS's sales.\n\n**Risks:** SWKS projected a revenue decline for the mobile segment and issued a lower profit forecast. They stated they anticipated a \"mid-to-high teens decline in mobile.\"\n\n**Offhand Comments: A lot of the firms that manufacture parts for the iPhone are linked in performance, especially if the iPhone is the main source of their sales- would be interesting to formulate some trading ideas from that.**\n\n**Related Tickers:** QCOM, AVGO, TXN.\n\n**Earnings today:** [**AMZN**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AMZN&p=d).",

Tariffs on Mexico/Canada are delayed, but we still have tariffs on China, and tariffs have been promised by Trump on the EU.\n\nNews: [As Trump Tariffs Take Effect, China Retaliates With Trade Measures Against U.S.](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/02/04/us/trump-tariffs-news?unlocked_article_code=1.uU4.ps2-.DRzgfM1GnN9i)\n\n**Ticker:** [**PLTR (Palantir Technologies Inc)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=PLTR&p=d)\n\n**Catalyst:** Reported earnings of $0.14 vs. $0.11 expected. Revenue of $828 million vs. $777 million expected. Management highlighted the power of AI and their sizable contracts, citing the nature of the AI war being winner-take-all.\n\n**Technicals:** PLTR absolutely exploded and hit $102 premarket, currently watching $100 level to see if we continue the move. Other than that unlikely to be trading this unless we have massive volume come in.\n\n**Catalyst/Sector Context:** The PLTR ER highlighted the growing demand for AI-driven solutions across government/commercial sectors. Company emphasized securing substantial contracts in the competitive AI landscape, important because they are more closely aligned with the current government.\n\n**Risks:** Obviously being more closely tied to the government means that it has more leeway to be more monopolistic/aggresive in their actions, Alex Karp and Peter Thiel are closely aligned with current government leaders.\n\n**Related Tickers:** MSFT, GOOGL, IBM, AMZN\n\n**Ticker:** [**NVDA (NVIDIA Corporation)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&p=d)\n\n**Catalyst:** Chinese AI company DeepSeek is reportedly preparing to switch to domestic GPUs to circumvent NVDA chip restrictions. DeepSeek has bypassed NVDA CUDA for certain operations, utilizing the PTX (Parallel Thread Execution) language instead. Additionally, on February 2nd, DeepSeek, in collaboration with SiliconFlow and Huawei Cloud, launched DeepSeek-R1/V3 inference services on Huawei's Ascend AI chips. Huawei is also promoting its new Ascend AI processors to Chinese groups considering \"inference\" as an option.\n\n**Technicals:** After the insane move we've seen from $150 to $118, I actually don't consider this to be earth shattering news- China has always been trying to develop their own semis and not using NVDA for training is what they were \"supposed\" to be doing due to the trade restrictions. I'm still long but selling calls against my position, recovery might be slow for NVDA. It's interesting that they are attempting to bypass CUDA, which is essentially the \"standard\" for ML/AI training nowadays on NVDA chips and developing their own.\n\n**Catalyst/Sector Context:** DeepSeek's move to adopt domestic GPUs and bypass CUDA indicates they're aiming for technological self-reliance amidst U.S. export restrictions, rather than trying to adopt more NVDA chips (which presumably isn't a viable long term strategy).\n\n**Risks:** Nvidia faces potential revenue loss if Chinese companies increasingly adopt domestic GPUs and alternative programming frameworks. The effectiveness of U.S. export controls may be undermined as Chinese firms develop workarounds.\n\n**Related Tickers:** AMD, INTC, QCOM, TSM\n\n**Ticker:** [**BABA**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=BABA&p=d)**/(oil stocks, car stocks, etc).**\n\n**Catalyst:** U.S. implemented a 10% tariff on all Chinese imports, aiming to address issues related to drug trafficking, particularly fentanyl. In response, China announced retaliatory tariffs effective February 10, including a 15% tariff on U.S. coal and liquefied natural gas, and a 10% tariff on crude oil, agricultural machinery, and large-engine vehicles.\n\n**Catalyst/Sector Context:** The imposition of these tariffs marks a significant escalation in U.S.-China trade tension and more volatility to come through Trump tweets- we might see a trade war again (sigh) like we did in 2019. Not 100% sure if agricultural machinery will affect stocks like DE but will look into it.\n\n**Related Tickers:** JD, BIDU, TCEHY, PDD\n\n**Offhand Comments:** There are going to be retaliation investigations against companies operating in America, INTC and GOOG have recently been announced as under investigation by China. But it's very important to remember which companies have a presence in China and which don't- for example, GOOG search hasn't worked in China since 2010 lol.\n\n**Ticker:** [**GRAB (Grab Holdings Limited)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=GRAB&p=d)\n\n**Catalyst:** Grab Holdings Ltd. is considering a takeover of its Indonesian rival, GoTo Group, at a valuation of approximately $7 billion.\n\n**Technicals:** Watching $5 level, no bias. I'm not 100% sure if there's an actual \"acquisition\" share price for GoTo but will keep eyes peeled for that acquisition premium.\n\n**Catalyst/Sector Context:** The potential merger represents a significant consolidation in SEA's ride-hailing and food delivery sectors. Mergers typically streamline operations and reduce competition, leading to improved profitability for the combined entity.\n\n**Risks:** The proposed merger may face regulatory hurdles, including antitrust concerns, which could delay or derail the deal.

There are 64 positions total and it's unrealistic that I'll be able to keep track of the performance/trajectory of that many companies. Buffet's \"pick a few winners\" comes to mind.

Initial temptation is gambler's fallacy (sell the low performers first and keep the better ones a bit longer).",

Anyone who was around at the time can testify that this really did represent consensus opinions in this sub at that time, which you can see in the comments of that post.  Note that the game store madness did not really begin until a couple weeks later, which is why it did not appear there.\n\nI felt like it was going to play out poorly so I bookmarked it, and now have been doing yearly updates.  After all, for something like this, you really need to give it a multiple year timeline at least.\n\nWe are now on year 4, and to date I have sarcastically remarked about how the sharp, financial geniuses of the time performed against SPY and VTI.

From its robust retail operations and cloud computing powerhouse AWS to its advertising business, device sales, and subscription services like Prime, Amazon has mastered the art of innovation and scale.\n\nOne of my favorite aspects is Amazon Prime, a service that bundles so much value into one membership. Beyond free shipping, Prime offers access to Prime Video, music streaming, exclusive deals, and more\u2014making it a must-have for millions of households globally.\n\nA recent highlight from Prime Video is its record-breaking performance in NFL streaming. The Steelers-Ravens playoff game brought in an impressive 22.07 million average viewers, setting a new high for Amazon\u2019s sports streaming efforts. While this figure lags behind Netflix\u2019s Christmas Day NFL stream and traditional broadcasters like Fox and CBS for other playoff games, it\u2019s a significant milestone. More importantly, Amazon\u2019s partnership with the NFL is driving Prime subscriptions and ad revenue. Their Thursday Night Football viewership grew 13% year-over-year in 2024, showcasing their ability to compete in the fiercely contested live sports space.\n\nLooking ahead, this is just the beginning for Amazon. With its unique ability to blend commerce, media, and technology, their continued investment in live sports and other high-impact content will be transformative\u2014not just for Prime Video but for the entire ecosystem. The future looks huge for Amazon, and that\u2019s why I admire their vision and execution.",

    "title": "Intel\u2019s CEO shakeup puts foundry plans, CHIPS Act cash at risk",
    "selftext": "Intel (INTC) is in crisis. The company forced out CEO Pat Gelsinger on Monday, its stock price is down more than 50% on the year, and the grand plan to add third-party semiconductor manufacturing to its repertoire is suddenly more unclear than ever.\n\nGelsinger\u2019s gambit to transform Intel into a US-based version of Taiwan\u2019s TSMC that builds chips for its rivals is one of the reasons the company received $7.8 billion in CHIPS Act funding. But the foundry business, which it plans to operate as an independent subsidiary, has been hemorrhaging money and its biggest customer is still Intel itself.\n\nYes, the company has picked up deals to build chips for Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon (AMZN), but that hasn\u2019t quelled calls for Intel to kill its third-party foundry plan. Bank of America Global Research analyst Vivek Arya wrote in an investor note that Intel could go as far as fully separating its design and manufacturing businesses.\n\nBut ditching its fabs, or fabrication facilities, is a lot easier said than done, especially if Intel wants to hold on to those CHIPS Act funds.\n\n\u201cThey just got the CHIPS Acts money. And if you look very closely at the details, it basically says that Intel cannot sell more than a controlling share of the manufacturing footprint,\u201d explained Mario Morales, group vice president of enabling technologies and semiconductors at IDC. \u201cSo that means that Intel will have to maintain manufacturing control of their capacity.\u201d\n\nIn other words, there\u2019s no easy path forward for the US\u2019s largest homegrown chip builder.\n\nThe Commerce Department and Intel announced the chipmaker would be getting CHIPS Act funding just last week, with the DoC saying the cash would help Intel expand its manufacturing capacity in the US, a key part of Gelsinger\u2019s plan to help the company compete with TSMC and Samsung, two of the largest chipmakers in the world.\n\nGelsinger initially unveiled the ambitious agenda, called IDM 2.0, or integrated device manufacturing 2.0, in 2021, the same year he took the reins as CEO. At the time, he said Intel would create a world-class foundry business. But Gelsinger took over an Intel beset by problems.\n\nLack of investment and missed opportunities over the years meant the company failed to catch the mobile wave and fell behind TSMC in design capabilities. And building out a global manufacturing footprint isn\u2019t cheap, which, for a company that was already hurting, wasn\u2019t ideal.\n\nGelsinger had four years to make the turnaround happen, and while Intel\u2019s chip design process is catching up, building chip manufacturing facilities takes time, more than Intel\u2019s board seemed interested in giving Gelsinger.\n\n\u201cSome of the problems that Intel had, and still has, are not things you can solve overnight. They are multiyear issues,\u201d said TECHnalysis founder and chief analyst Bob O\u2019Donnell.\n\n\u201cGelsinger started on a path to follow some of these things. And I think ultimately, at the highest level, what he chose to do, which is to get the manufacturing stuff back in shape and to work on design, is ultimately what the company needs to do.\u201d\n\nNow Intel has to make a decision: carry on with Gelsinger\u2019s plan or cut back and focus on its own chip building capabilities or give up the business entirely. But doing that means saying goodbye to CHIPS Act money unless it can get approval from the Commerce Department\n\nUnder the terms of the CHIPS Act agreement, Intel is prohibited from certain change of control transactions. If the company spins off its foundry business, it has to hold on to at least 50.1% of the voting rights of the entity if it\u2019s a private company. If the new entity goes public, a third party can\u2019t own 35% or more of it. That means Intel can\u2019t simply cut its foundry business loose and go fabless if it wants to hold on to that CHIPS money.\n\nBut moving forward with the foundry model could be difficult.\n\n\u201cI think as a combined entity it's hard to survive, because the biggest problem is your potential customers for foundry are all your competitors against Intel products,\u201d explained Gartner analyst Gaurav Gupta. \u201cSo how would they have trust in Intel foundry and become its customers, right?\u201d\n\nIf Intel does end up pulling back on its third-party manufacturing ambitions, however, it could end up eating a good portion of the losses.\n\n\u201cYou'd have to scale back. You'd have to lay off people. I'm sure there would be some sunk cost, but the alternative is you keep losing billions of dollars a quarter,\u201d Citi head of US semiconductor research Chris Danely told Yahoo Finance. \u201cSo, I think you just need to scrap it. Take your lumps. If you have to, return the money to the government.\u201d\n\nWhile Danely believes Intel should drop its goal of serving as a global foundry for other companies, he says it should continue to build its own chips.\n\n\u201cI still think they should manufacture their own CPUs,\u201d he explained. \"There's been speculation for a long time that they're just going to turn the keys over to [TSMC] and have [TSMC] make everything. We don't think that that's the right move.\u201d\n\nBefore that, however, Intel needs to find a new permanent CEO.\n\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/intels-ceo-shakeup-puts-foundry-plans-chips-act-cash-at-risk-194227625.html",

    "title": "The Crash of the stock market has arrived. Price/Earnings ratio just broke 30 for the entire S&P 500. ",
    "selftext": "Almost 90 days ago I made a post in an alternate subreddit regarding why I believe the stock market will begin to crash within 120 days -- Essentially the crash will begin by the day before the election. I have included that entire post below -- and all of these reasons still remain relevant... Moreso than ever with the news from the Middle East today. Obviously the port strike is expediting things today. Nonetheless -- I think the post is super relevant, and for some reason, the moderators of WSB deleted the post after 6 hours, despite it receiving over 2.2 million views, and over 1100 shares. \n\nThe ride the market has been on, quite simply, has been insane.\n\nAccording to generally accepted wisdom -- by investing in the S&P 500, you can anticipate to double your money, on average, every 6.5 years. I'm not 100% certain as to why that's the accepted figure -- as calculating the last 14 6.5 year periods the average rate of return has been 64%.\n\nBelow is a chart of the average price/rate of return of GSPC (The S&P) over the last 14 cycles.. I couldn't easily find data prior to this..\n\n|Year|GSPC Price|6.5 year return on investment|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n||\n|1933.5|10.91||\n|1940|12.05|10.44%|\n|1946.5|18.43|52.95%|\n|1953|26.38|43.13%|\n|1959.5|58.68|122%|\n|1966|92.88|58%|\n|1972.5|107.14|15%|\n|1979|99.93|-7.22%|\n|1985.5|191.85|91.90%|\n|1992|408.78|113%|\n|1998.5|1133.84|177%|\n|2005|1181.27|4.10%|\n|2011.5|1320.64|11.70%|\n|2018|2471.65|87.10%|\n|2024.5|5525.29|123%|\n\nWhile the last two cycles don't necessarily ring any alarm bells -- we have just more than doubled, twice, looking at the last two cycles -- There is one massive, bloated, shit filled elephant in the room... Price to Earnings Ratio.\n\nHistorically, the Price to Earnings ratio for the S&P has sat just under 20 (the easiest data I could find puts it at 19.4x between 1974 and 2017 -- I'm not grabbing any arbitrary dates or numbers here). The Median value has it under 18x, and there have even been extended periods of time where it traded at +/- 10x.\n\nCurrently -- the P/E ratio sits at 28.71 -- roughly 150% of what is normal.\n\nIn the history of the S&P, the P/E ratio has hit this level only 3 times...\n\n* Immediately preceding, and then during, the Dot Com Bubble (P/E broke 30 +/- April 2001).\n* Immediately preceding, and then during, the Global Financial Crisis (P/E broke 30 +/- October 2008).\n* The quarter after Covid hit. (P/E broke 30 +/- March 2020).\n\nImages aren't allowed in this subreddit -- but if you go to the multpl website you will see we finished trading yesterday, 09/30, at a P/E of 30.07\n\nHistorically -- what has happened to the markets after crossing this mark? In all three scenarios, by the time we crossed a P/E of 30, the dam had already started to break.\n\n* During the Dot Com bubble, the S&P 500 was already down 19% from its highs, and would fall another 34% before finally starting to recover. By the the time the bleeding stopped, it had lost 47% of its value.\n* During the global financial crisis, an almost identical story can be told. The S&P had lost 18% of its value by time P/E broke 30, and when it finally bottomed out in February of 2009, it lost 53% of its total value.\n* Covid, obviously, was a much quicker recovery... as we only fell 32%, and had bounced back in less than 6 months time (reason for which outlined later).\n\n**Okay -- so**\u00a0***Maybe***\u00a0**we have a price to earnings ratio problem, but you're still not sold. What else do we have going on?**\n\nOutside of the fact that I firmly believe that the market is overvalued today, I think there are several other major issues that we are facing in the current environment -- and while I could write a diatribe for each, for purposes of succinctness, I'll simply outline them via bullet points below.\n\n* Credit card debt is at an all time high, and outside of a brief period after Covid checks arrived, has been rising since 2013.\n* Younger Americans are in the most trouble with credit card debt. As boomers continue to retire, it will be the working class most disproportionately affected.\n* Credit card delinquency rates are the highest they've been since 2011.\n* Auto loans debt and average auto loan payments are the highest they've been at any point in history. Auto loan delinquency rates are the highest they've been since 2010.\n* The stock market is insanely top heavy right now. The Magnificent 7 (Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), and Tesla (TSLA)) now account for 45% of the entire value of the Nasdaq. They account for roughly 30% of the entire stock market combined. As of today -- they are trading at a combined P/E of 42x. A correction in these 7 companies would be absolutely catastrophic for the entire market as a whole.\n* We are starting to see a weakening of the labor market. Furthermore -- I do not believe the jobs numbers are entirely as they seem. I think many of the jobs 'added' over the last 18 months have been individuals picking up second jobs to help make ends meet. Any reasonable increase in the unemployment rate have absolutely massive consequences.\n* Many banks are holding on to massive unrealized losses. While this has the potential to hit the regional banks the worst, some of the largest banks -- including Bank of America, Charles Schwab, and USAA have unbooked security losses that are greater than 50% of their equity capital.\n* Regional banks are at risk due to the massive amounts of US treasury notes they hold that were bought during Covid. In short -- nobody was borrowing money to buy homes or cars. Banks, flush with cash, took said money and bought US T notes with this money so they could earn some interest on it. This was at a time when interest rates were very low. Now that interest rates are high -- demand for these old t notes is essentially non existent, as you buy new t notes that pay a much higher rate of return. If any sort of bank run starts, these banks will be forced to liquidate said t-bills, and they will have to sell them at a loss. If too many people do this simultaneously, the bank will become insolvent -- like what we saw happen with Silicon Valley bank, Signature Bank and First Republic Bank. (Side note -- the failure of these three banks alone was larger than the combined total of bank failures in 2008 during the global financial crisis).\n* The US government still has a spending problem. Our deficit has grown by $500 million since I started writing this an hour ago.\n* Global tensions are high -- and rising. Massive protests are erupting all over Europe.\n* The US is involved in two proxy wars that don't appear as if they will abate any time soon.\n* The political division in the US is as dramatic as I've seen it at any point in my existence. Perhaps those older and wiser than me can chime in here -- but it seems most are resorting to tribal, identity politics split down party lines.\n* Commercial real estate is starting to buckle. Covid brought about work from home, and with many offices retaining those practices, or allowing partial work from home, office space supply far outpaces demand. This problem is exacerbated by high interest rates. Most commercial loans are done on 5 or 7 year balloon. When that balloon is bout to come due, the owner of that property will refinance the loan, restarting the 5 or 7 year period to avoid paying off the balance owed on the property. Many of these property owners that refinanced into low interest rates in 2020, during covid, when rates bottomed out -- are now having to get a new loan to keep from paying their balloon. However, with interest rates more than twice what they were several years ago, and vacancy rates skyrocketing, many of these real estate owners will not be able to pay the monthly mortgage on their buildings. Commercial Real Estate foreclosures jumped 117% in March alone.\n* Housing has become increasingly less affordable for many Americans. For 2022 -- the most recent year I could find data -- a family earning the median US household income, renting a median priced US home, was spending 40% of their income on rent.\n* Countries are abandoning the US dollar in droves.\n\nI believe some of these issues, on their own, are enough to cause serious economic turmoil. Bundled together, I don't see how we aren't in for a very rude awakening.\n\n**This economic downturn may be severe.**\n\nIn the three times this has happened before -- the action, or lake thereof varied dramatically. During scenario one -- the dot com bubble -- the government largely just let the companies fail. While I was only 11 at the time, my understanding is that there really were no bailouts here because the only people really hurt were the investors in those companies -- unlike scenario two. During the GFC, shuttering banks would have resulted in a complete collapse of the US (and really global) financial system. While I won't get into partisan politics, I'm of the belief that the covid bailouts were entirely unnecessary -- and more importantly for this post -- the reason that the upcoming crash is going to be so insanely problematic.\n\n**Bailouts on any level, whether to companies, banks, or directly to citizens, will inevitably increase inflation. I don't think they are on the table for this correction.**\n\nPeople have painted the inflation problem as a result of supply chain issues... And while supply chain issues didn't help, I think the bigger issue, by far, was the sheer amount of money we printed. You cannot make $4 trillion appear out of thin air and expect that every dollar in circulation isn't going to suddenly become worth less money. We just lived through this reality after the Covid printing.\n\nThis will largely tie the feds hands. Print more money -- we find ourselves in a cycle of ever increasing prices and higher interest rates.\n\n**What happens from here?**\n\nI don't know. Don't listen to me. I'm an idiot. Stock market will probably just continue to go up. I'm probably wrong about 100% of this.\n\nThe prediction in bold below is what I posted 90 days ago. I now believe the top is officially in -- that we won't see another ATH for a long time. \n\n**My Prediction? GSPC/SPY cruise up a tiny bit further, to +/- $5900/$590 -- before retreating to $3500/$350 by 12/2025.**\n\nMy positions: \n\nBought 50 $570 10/2 puts at open this morning right at open.

    "selftext": "* Tesla's FSD, which is now promoted as fully-supervised, is now the core technology behind the robotaxi service the company plans to launch.\n* Most analysts assign hefty value for the FSD technology alone.\n\n  \nWith just two weeks to go for Tesla, Inc.\u2019s TSLA Robotaxi unveil event, an analyst painted a bleak picture of the company\u2019s self-driving technology.\n\n\n\n**What Happened**: Tesla\u2019s FSD, which is now promoted as fully-supervised FSD, is a \u201csafety disaster\u201d and \u201cgalaxies away from being anywhere close to the competition,\u201d said GLJ Research\u2019s Gordon Johnson in a note. Tesla\u2019s competitors in this arena are Alphabet, Inc.\u2019s GOOGL GOOG Waymo and General Motors Corp.\u2019s GM Cruise.\n\n\n\nWith Tesla eyeing the rollout of its Fully Supervised FSD in China, the Elon Musk-led company would be up against domestic player Baidu, Inc.\u2019s BIDU Apollo Go.\n\n\n\nJohnson referenced reviews by two sources to make his case. Independent lab AMCI Testing, which tried the technology, said the overall performance of Tesla\u2019s camera-enabled autonomous-driving software is \u201csuspect.\u201d In a report released on Tuesday, the firm said its evaluation showed how often human intervention was required for safe operation. \u201cIn fact, our drivers had to intervene over 75 times during the evaluation; an average of once every 13 miles,\u201d it said.\n\n\n\nWhile the FSD 12.5.1 was impressive, it is incredibly dangerous for drivers operating with FSD to drive with their hands in their laps or away from the steering wheels, it said. \u201cThe most critical moments of FSD miscalculation are split-second events that even professional drivers, operating with a test mindset, must focus on catching,\u201d it added.\n\n\n\nJohnson also referred to data from [Teslafsdtracker.com](http://Teslafsdtracker.com), which aggregates TSLA FSD driving experiences/data, in real-time from users, which shows that the latest iteration of FSD has a **critical disengagement every 130 miles and every 72 miles when driven in a city.**\n\n  \nData reported by competitors to the California\u00a0Department of Motor Vehicles show that miles to disengagement data for various players are as follows:\n\n* Waymo: 17,311 miles\n* **Amazon, Inc.\u2019s** AMZN Zoox: 177,602 miles\n* [Pony.Ai](http://Pony.Ai) (startup): 17,077 miles\n* WeRide (startup): 21,191 miles\n\nThe **metric for Tesla is 13 miles**, based on AMCI\u2019s statistics, Johnson said, although Tesla doesn\u2019t yet report data to California DMV, given its FSD tech is **only Level 2.**  \n\n\n**Why It\u2019s Important:** Johnson noted that many sell-side analysts assign a valuation of $300 billion to $600 billion for Tesla\u2019s FSD technology. In real-time, the value is close to zero, he said, adding that it could be negative, given the \u201cliability of putting something this dangerous on roads.\u201d\n\n  \nAccording to Ark\u2019s valuation model, by 2029, robotaxis, which has FSD as its core technology, would account for 63% of Tesla\u2019s revenue and 86% of EBITDA.\n\nFuture Fund LLC Managing Partner Gary Black, a Tesla bull, said in a recent post on X that Tesla's FSD is not yet close to the 99.99% efficacy needed for unsupervised autonomy.\n\n\n\nIn premarket trading on Thursday, Tesla rose 2.05% to $262.30\n\n  \nSource: [benzinga.com](https://www.benzinga.com/news/24/09/41047267/safety-disaster-tesla-fsd-galaxies-away-from-being-anywhere-close-to-competition-says-bearish-analys)",

    "selftext": "I made a lot of trades in 2024, I was up 50k at one point and then gave back almost all the profit and I am only up around 4k currently for 2024. I am assuming I only have to pay capital gains taxes on 4k profit for the year, not 50k or some figure more than my overall gains of 4k because of wash sale rule. I did lot of day trading and buying same stock within 30 days of selling and I wanted to understand the implications of wash sale rule. I currently have sold all my positions and do not hold any stock/options and I am up 4k on the year.\n\nExample 1: I bought NVDA calls on August 14, sold on August 15 for gains of 5k. Then I bought NVDA calls on August 20 and sold on August 25 for loss of 3k. I did this several times with NVDA stock and options and have profit of 20k from NVDA and loss of 19k with overall net gain of around 1k on NVDA. I am trying to understand wash sale rule and my understanding is I only have to pay capital gains taxes for 1k on NVDA. My cost basis on my second purchase gets adjusted from profit on first purchase and my cost basis for third purchase gets adjusted based on profit/loss from second sell and so on for future purchase. Is this correct statement? Also, I currently do not hold any NVDA stocks or options, I sold them all.\n\nExample 2: I did same thing with AMZN stock too. I bought calls, sold for some loss, bought more calls within 30 days and sold for some profit and rinse and repeat. I did this multiple times throughout the year.\n\nI traded mostly tech stocks and at one point was in profit in excess of 50k. However I did not sell at the top and the stocks came crashing down and I lost all my profit. At one point I lost all profit and was 20k down on my cost basis too. I was able to recover my loss and I am up 4k in the year. I am now thinking about my Uncle sam and how much does he want for 2024. With no current positions in any stock/options currently, my thinking is just taxes on 4k profit. Let me know if I am wrong or if there is something that I am overlooking and if I need to put more money away for my taxes.",

    "selftext": "And I think Amazon should buy them.\n\nDrug stores have evolved from the time they first popped up and people love shopping there because its, convenient.  \n\nPros\n\n-Amazon is an online retailer with no real retail space yet. Their first stores weren't done right. \n\n-Amazon already has an online medical clinic(One Medical) and pharmacy business that could be easily integrated together.\n\n-Amazon with their analytics could easily stock each store and location with the right products from their online inventory making each store more profitable.\n\n-Amazon has high shipping/delivery costs and growing each year. people are starting to have a package theft issue. Your local store can easily become a pick up spot of your packages, safely. Whole foods stores are very limited for pick up, same with pick up lockers. \n\n-Would also be a good returns spot, no need for Kohls or UPS eating into costs. \n\n-Could have bigger stores in some locations for a bigger variety of products and services. Kroger's has some grocery stores and some marketplace stores. Amazon is essentially a giant warehouse that has to ship everything to your doorstep. \n\n-Amazon is launching a Shein and Temu competitor, stores could easily offer cheaper products in the right neighborhoods. What usually deters people from making a purchase is the shipping cost, nobody wants to order $35 of stuff just to avoid the shipping fee, plus tax.  \n\n\n\n-Walgreens \n\n\t-more than 8,700 retail locations across the U.S.\n\n\t-annual revenue for 2023 was $1451B, Amzn makes this in a quarter\n\n\t  (1) Pharmacy:\t         $87B 60%\n\n\t  (2) Retail:\t         $37B 26%\n\n\t  (3) Wholesale & Others:$20B 14%\n\n\t-Walgreens owns Alliance Boots, a retail pharmacy/beauty store across the UK: https://www.boots-uk.com/about-boots-uk/our-purpose-and-values/our-stores/ \n\n\t-Boots owns The No7 Beauty Company:  https://www.no7company.com/\n\n\t-Most importantly Walgreens has ALOT if not most of their stores in busy high traffic areas making their locations valuable and offers convenience shopping. \n\n\t\n\nCons\n\n-Walgreens has $32B in debt\n\n-Might need regulatory approval but Whole Foods got approved so this shouldn't be much of a problem \n\n-Will likely need to close some unprofitable stores and sell the land or transform them into something else\n\n\n\nThis deal makes more sense than Amazon buying Whole Foods, and they already have this retail experience. If Amazon doesn't make an offer i think a private equity company will take it private and turn the business around. \n\n\n\nI like the stock. Amazons acquisition would revitalize the brand and bring new excitement if done right.  Bought some shares because they are cheap and this is way over sold. \n\n",

Of course some bigger losers I have sold off. *$7934 invested, $9950 current.*  \n**AMZN: +43.54% \\[10.95% of portfolio\\]**\n\n**AAPL: +35.26% \\[13.04% of portfolio\\]**\n\n**TSLA: + 11.79% \\[9.40% of portfolio\\]**\n\n**GOOG: + 60.92% \\[11.15% of portfolio\\]**\n\n**NTDOY: + 16.25% \\[8.61% of portfolio\\]**\n\n**TYL: + 73.72% \\[6.36% of portfolio\\]**\n\n**TTD: +26.22% \\[6.23% of portfolio\\]**\n\n**BETZ: +1.32% \\[4.91% of portfolio\\]**\n\n**INTU: +35.99% \\[6.77% of portfolio\\]**\n\n**PI: +85.98% \\[5.90% of portfolio\\]**\n\n**STZ: -8.95% \\[5.36% of portfolio\\]**\n\n**FWONK: +11.27% \\[6.60% of portfolio\\]**\n\n**PINS: -18.21% \\[4.74% of portfolio\\]**",

    "title": "Analyzing the Analysts: Using average analyst price target to identify buying opportunities amongst the top 100 companies in the S&P",
    "selftext": "Hello everyone,\n\nI'm a lazy investor and don't like to do much due diligence, but I do like to make money. Unfortunately these two things about me are often at odds as I've lost money in the past for not doing my DD. As such, I continue to be lazy but I try and find ways to work around doing due diligence and hopefully finding loop holes.\n\nOne such way that I have been thinking about recently is using analyst ratings, reviews and price targets as a surrogate for due diligence. In essence, I try to just have these analysts do the work for me. The idea is that much in the same way that with those who believe in technical analysis hold that everything you need to know about a stock is baked into it's price action, and so when something good happens the stock price goes up and when something bad happens the stock price goes down, thus all you need is to analyze trends in stock price and you'll be analyzing everything about the stock by proxy, I have a thesis (or theory) that perhaps you can do the same or something similar with analyst price targets of companies.\n\nNow I know that anyone who has read this far already thinks I'm an idiot. Many experienced individual investors probably find market analysts to be stupid and therefore I'm stupid for following their lead, but I would argue to the contrary for a few reasons. As much as I have put in a lot of effort to learn about how the market operates (been investing for the last 6 years, started learning actively about it as much as I could a couple years prior to that), there is still much I don't know as I don't have a finance or economics degree. Moreover, as bad as you may think an analyst is, they are at least competent enough to keep their job as an analyst at the investment firm that allows them to make stock price target selections. Lastly, and most importantly, what I am about to discuss below uses the aggregate of numerous analyst price targets so I'm not relying on a single analyst, but several (probably between 10 and 40 per company). I think if two-dozen analysts are strongly in favor of a company, it is unlikely that my novice investor wisdom would have researched the company and found a flaw that they all missed.\n\nSo what I did yesterday evening was go through the top 100 S&P 500 companies by market cap and find the current average price target for them on Yahoo Finance. I then divided the current stock price (at the close on 7/31) by that price target and expressed it as a percentage to see how far off the company was from the average price target analysts were aiming for. Then I also listed how many total ratings each company had, and how many of them were 'Strong Buys' and 'Buys'.\n\nThis yielded the following table:\n\n|+|A|B|C|D|E|F|G|H|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|1|Company|Current Price|Price Target|Percent to Target|Total Ratings|# Strong Buy Ratings|# Buy Ratings|% of Ratings that were Strong Buys|\n|2|AAPL|222.08|209.76|105.87%|38|11|21|28.95%|\n|3|MSFT|418.35|459.66|91.01%|34|14|13|41.18%|\n|4|NVDA|117.02|125.69|93.10%|38|14|15|36.84%|\n|5|AMZN|186.98|206.43|90.58%|47|15|28|31.91%|\n|6|META|474.83|490.04|96.90%|63|21|34|33.33%|\n|7|GOOG|173.15|185.45|93.37%|5|0|3|0.00%|\n|8|BRK.B|438.5|441.47|99.33%|6|1|3|16.67%|\n|9|LLY|804.27|817.03|98.44%|22|9|8|40.91%|\n|10|AVGO|160.68|180.62|88.96%|29|10|17|34.48%|\n|11|JPM|212.8|200.66|106.05%|28|9|13|32.14%|\n|12|TSLA|232.07|189.09|122.73%|23|0|0|0.00%|\n|13|UNH|576.16|569.6|101.15%|22|11|11|50.00%|\n|14|XOM|118.59|122.83|96.55%|25|5|11|20.00%|\n|15|V|265.67|282.26|94.12%|39|13|22|33.33%|\n|16|JNJ|157.85|158.53|99.57%|23|4|8|17.39%|\n|17|PG|160.76|161.5|99.54%|22|6|4|27.27%|\n|18|MA|463.71|474.87|97.65%|39|14|20|35.90%|\n|19|HD|368.16|355.97|103.42%|33|12|12|36.36%|\n|20|COST|822|886.84|92.69%|29|7|11|24.14%|\n|21|WMT|68.64|68.29|100.51%|32|8|7|25.00%|\n|22|MRK|113.13|132.14|85.61%|21|4|7|19.05%|\n|23|BAC|40.31|41.95|96.09%|30|6|16|20.00%|\n|24|CVX|160.47|167.84|95.61%|24|6|10|25.00%|\n|25|NFLX|628.35|640.43|98.11%|41|11|14|26.83%|\n|26|KO|66.74|64.8|102.99%|25|5|7|20.00%|\n|27|CRM|258.8|274.18|94.39%|45|16|25|35.56%|\n|28|ADBE|551.65|566.58|97.36%|31|11|14|35.48%|\n|29|PEP|172.67|168.65|102.38%|22|10|10|45.45%|\n|30|TMO|613.34|629.42|97.45%|15|8|6|53.33%|\n|31|AMD|144.48|175.48|82.33%|31| | |0.00%|\n|32|LIN|453.5|475.32|95.41%| | | |#DIV/0!|\n|33|ORCL|139.45|140.03|99.59%|36|10|16|27.78%|\n|34|WFC|59.34|59.8|99.23%|31|4|8|12.90%|\n|35|ACN|330.62|348.01|95.00%|29|7|9|24.14%|\n|36|CSCO|48.45|50.56|95.83%|27|8|11|29.63%|\n|37|MCD|265.4|276.47|96.00%|33|8|15|24.24%|\n|38|QCOM|180.95|191.24|94.62%|23|2|7|8.70%|\n|39|GE|170.2|171.93|98.99%|17|5| |29.41%|\n|40|ABT|105.94|124.37|85.18%|20|7|6|35.00%|\n|41|TXN|203.81|187.18|108.88%|32|6|8|18.75%|\n|42|DHR|277.08|284.09|97.53%|17|7|6|41.18%|\n|43|AMGN|332.47|320.24|103.82%|25|3|7|12.00%|\n|44|INTU|647.35|711.36|91.00%|22|6|3|27.27%|\n|45|PM|115.16|115.74|99.50%|18|2|7|11.11%|\n|46|PFE|30.54|29.38|103.95%|22|2|11|9.09%|\n|47|IBM|192.14|172.59|111.33%|25|4|4|16.00%|\n|48|DIS|93.69|123.11|76.10%|30|5|10|16.67%|\n|49|VZ|40.52|45.6|88.86%|32|2|6|6.25%|\n|50|CAT|346.2|337.62|102.54%|24|4|7|16.67%|\n|51|NOW|814.39|807.1|100.90%|34|13|17|38.24%|\n|52|AMAT|212.2|248.8|85.29%|21|4|15|19.05%|\n|53|GS|509.03|476.64|106.80%|27|4|7|14.81%|\n|54|CMCSA|41.27|46.36|89.02%|31|12|18|38.71%|\n|55|SPGI|484.73|521.39|92.97%|15|1|9|6.67%|\n|56|RTX|117.49|103.93|113.05%| | | |#DIV/0!|\n|57|ISRG|444.61|471.87|94.22%|17|6|5|35.29%|\n|58|NEE|76.39|80.23|95.21%|15|5|8|33.33%|\n|59|UNP|246.73|242.11|101.91%|29|5|7|17.24%|\n|60|AXP|253.04|253.26|99.91%|28|6|4|21.43%|\n|61|LOW|245.51|250.99|97.82%|32|8|10|25.00%|\n|62|T|19.25|19.3|99.74%|30|6|3|20.00%|\n|63|HON|204.75|226.96|90.21%|20|7|9|35.00%|\n|64|UBER|64.47|79.96|80.63%| | | |#DIV/0!|\n|65|VRTX|495.72|483.91|102.44%|27|10|12|37.04%|\n|66|MS|103.21|105.64|97.70%|27|3|14|11.11%|\n|67|TJX|113.02|107.04|105.59%|27|9|14|33.33%|\n|68|INTC|30.74|38.02|80.85%|41| |18|0.00%|\n|69|BKNG|3715.01|4192.39|88.61%| | | |#DIV/0!|\n|70|PGR|214.12|237.47|90.17%|19|5|4|26.32%|\n|71|C|64.88|71.01|91.37%|29|5|12|17.24%|\n|72|ELV|532.03|599.13|88.80%| | | |#DIV/0!|\n|73|BLK|876.5|936.85|93.56%|15|3|9|20.00%|\n|74|PLD|126.05|135.68|92.90%|18|4|8|22.22%|\n|75|LMT|541.92|535.31|101.23%|22|7| |31.82%|\n|76|ETN|304.79|345.86|88.13%|24|3|4|12.50%|\n|77|REGN|1079.19|1104.34|97.72%|26|7|6|26.92%|\n|78|MU|109.82|174.41|62.97%|31|8|20|25.81%|\n|79|CB|275.66|277.84|99.22%|19|5|11|26.32%|\n|80|SYK|327.45|378.81|86.44%|27|11|6|40.74%|\n|81|ADI|231.38|255.84|90.44%|26|6|10|23.08%|\n|82|LRCX|921.24|1041.75|88.43%|19|3|12|15.79%|\n|83|MMC|222.57|223.48|99.59%|19|4|7|21.05%|\n|84|BSX|73.88|87.57|84.37%|24|10|8|41.67%|\n|85|MDT|80.32|92.43|86.90%|23|4|7|17.39%|\n|86|BA|190.6|219.35|86.89%|25|7|7|28.00%|\n|87|ADP|262.62|264.65|99.23%|18|1|1|5.56%|\n|88|AMT|220.4|230.39|95.66%|22|7|14|31.82%|\n|89|PANW|324.73|343.43|94.55%|41|13|16|31.71%|\n|90|KLAC|823.07|868.07|94.82%|14|2|4|14.29%|\n|91|BX|142.15|135.47|104.93%|14|6|6|42.86%|\n|92|CI|348.67|393.25|88.66%|17|6|7|35.29%|\n|93|BMY|47.56|50.47|94.23%|22|5|4|22.73%|\n|94|GILD|76.06|81.02|93.88%|28|2|11|7.14%|\n|95|SCHW|65.19|73.89|88.23%|19|5|9|26.32%|\n|96|DE|371.98|422.99|87.94%|22|4|3|18.18%|\n|97|FI|163.57|177.14|92.34%|19|1|2|5.26%|\n|98|UPS|130.37|144.61|90.15%|26|3|2|11.54%|\n|99|SO|83.52|79.51|105.04%|17|1|4|5.88%|\n|100|TMUS|182.28|197.95|92.08%|30|7|16|23.33%|\n|101|COP|111.2|141.51|78.58%|21|6|9|28.57%|\n\n\nBased on this table above, I tried to identify some companies that met a few criteria.

Thinner ipad, who cares?  New chip, no software yet to take advantage of it probably for the better part of a year.  Virt Reality, no killer app to drive it.  AI, they seem to be late in their development, although Apple has always been the greatest at their catchup/surpassing game.  I think there maybe better options for me, looking for a sounding board.  Still looking to keep it in steadily plodding behemoths for ease of mind, but something better than flat YTD performance i got out of apple this year.\n\nFirst up MSFT, up 14% YTD, has a wide moat, seems to be well positioned for AI, although their gaming sector is looking kinda soft to me.  Like their latest offerings in pc with infused AI, and tablet.\n\nNext up AMZN, up 21% YTD, also a wide moat, with a lot of stability in their supplied items and businesses.  Nothing really lights up the sky, just plodding along.  I think they have an AI strength used in their background business, but has an appearance of hiding, as it has no consumer face to it.\n\nLastly NVDA, up 110% YTD.  They are definitely the star of the moment, and I think there is still gas in this tank, but being a hardware vendor mostly with some software driven solutions for AI for their platform alone, they may have locked up a good lead that will only grow.\n\nLooking at doing a 50/25/25 split (MSFT/AMZN/NVDA), thoughts?

    "selftext": "STOCKHOLM, May 8 (Reuters) - Telefonica Germany\u00a0(TEF.MC) will move one million 5G customers to Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud later this month, company executives told Reuters, in a bold move by the U.S. online retailer to break into the global telecoms market.\n\nWhile some telecom networks have moved IT and other non-core operations to the public cloud, the move by the subsidiary of Spanish group Telefonica is a global first where an existing mobile operator is switching its core network to a public cloud.\n\nBig cloud-computing services firms such as Amazon\u00a0(AMZN.O) and Microsoft\u00a0(MSFT.O) have been trying to move more into the telecoms sector, lured by billions of dollars in potential revenue, but operators have been wary of the capability of public clouds in handling a mobile network.\n\n\"I want to see it working for at least one to two quarters and have a roadmap to move at least 30-40% of my customer base by 2025-2026,\" said Mallik Rao, Chief Technology & Information Officer at O2 Telefonica, also known as Telefonica Germany.\n\nThe company has 45 million customers in Germany.\n\nAWS and O2 Telefonica did not disclose financial details of the deal.\n\nThe core network, which consists of high-performance servers in data centers, is the heart of a mobile network that securely routes data and calls at high speeds. A public cloud will cut costs, increase scale and allow repairs to be done without service disruption.\n\nU.S.-based Dish\u00a0(DISH.MX), which built its mobile network from scratch, became in 2021 the only telecom company to use AWS cloud for core network.\n\n\"Dish was much easier because they had no existing systems that had to be modified to work with the cloud,\" AWS vice president Jan Hofmeyr said in an interview.\n\nNokia, which also worked with Dish, will provide the software and AWS will provide its infrastructure for Telefonica.\n\nTelefonica first worked with AWS and Ericsson, and then swapped to Nokia and AWS, Rao said. \"The days of trial are over. I don't want to keep on trying.\"\n\nThe global telecom cloud market is expected to reach $108.7 billion by 2030 from $19.7 billion in 2021, making it a growth driver for companies such as Amazon.\n\n\"We want to make it a business to run telco workloads,\" AWS' Hofmeyr said, adding that the company expects more deals with other operators in the next 12 months.\n\n\"I would say in most cases the discussion is about timing versus should we move into the cloud.\"\n\nSource: https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/amazon-breaks-into-europe-5g-networks-with-telefonica-cloud-deal-2024-05-08/",

But the outcome, which will be decided by US District Judge Amit Mehta in the weeks or months to come, also has giant implications for some of the other big names in the tech world.\n\n>That's because Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), and Meta (META) are defending themselves against a series of other federal- and state-led antitrust suits, some of which make similar claims, and because all three stand to lose or gain depending on the outcome.\n\n>The government argues Google is violating Section 2 of the Sherman Act by blocking competitors from entering three distinct markets: general online search, search advertising, and search text advertising.\n\n>A government win would put at risk the billions of dollars in mutually lucrative contracts between Google and Apple, as well as deals with other device manufacturers and telecom companies.\n\n> The government alleged in its case that Google pays billions of dollars each year to LG, Motorola (MSI), and Samsung; major US wireless carriers such as AT&T (T), T-Mobile (TMUS), and Verizon (VZ); and browser developers such as Mozilla, Opera, and UCWeb.\n\n>Government prosecutors have alleged that Google had been paying Apple an estimated $8 billion to $12 billion per year \u2014 a portion of search ad revenue \u2014 in exchange for awarding Google Search default placement on Apple devices.\n\n>The government has yet to say what precise remedy it desires should it prevail against Google.

    "title": "Spotify turns a profit as earnings and revenue beat estimstes",
    "selftext": "Spotify Technology (SPOT) reported fiscal first quarter earnings on Tuesday that beat expectations on both the top and bottom lines. The audio giant also swung to a profit as it continues to implement its recent \"efficiency\" strategy.\n\nOver the past year, Spotify has committed to multiple rounds of layoffs in addition to price increases and other initiatives to boost top-line growth and improve margins. The company said it will be more intentional about future investments after spending billions on its push into the crowded podcast market.\n\nThe audio giant reported operating income of 168 million euros ($179 million), compared with a loss of 156 million euros in the prior-year period. This was below company guidance of 180 million euros as social charges came in higher than expected, \"driven by share price appreciation during the quarter\", according to Spotify.\n\nIt also guided to a strong Q2 operating income of 250 million euros, well ahead of Wall Street consensus expectations. Revenue guidance for the second quarter also came in ahead of estimates \u2014 3.8 billion euros versus the 3.76 billion euros that was expected.\n\nOn top of more deliberate spending, Spotify will reportedly once again raise prices after hiking the cost of certain subscription plans last summer.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg, Spotify plans to raise prices by about $1 to $2 a month in five markets, including the UK, Australia, and Pakistan. The changes are expected to come at the end of April, with US prices to rise \"later this year.\" The report also said Spotify plans to introduce a cheaper option that does not include audiobooks.\n\nThe stock moved more than 9% higher in pre-market trading on Tuesday following the results.\n\nThe streaming service reported net income of 197 million euros ($210 million), or earnings of 0.97 euros per share. That was ahead of analyst expectations of earnings of 0.65 euros per share. It also compares with the year-earlier period loss of 225 million euros, or a loss of 1.16 euros a share.\n\nGross margins came in stronger than expected at 27.6%, beating company guidance of 26.4%. The streamer said it expects margins to tick up to 28.1% in the second quarter, primarily driven by year-over-year improvements in music and podcasting.\n\nSpotify has previously said it expects the metric to come in between 30% and 35% over the long term amid plans to further scale its podcasting and ads business.\n\nRevenue, meanwhile, totaled 3.64 billion euros ($3.88 billion) \u2014 20% higher compared with the first quarter of 2023, and above Wall Street expectations of 3.61 billion euros.\n\nUser figures\n\nTotal monthly active users (MAUs) came in below company estimates of 618 million to hit 615 million in the quarter \u2014 but still a 19% improvement compared with the total in the year-ago period. The streaming service anticipates Q2 MAUs to come in at 631 million.\n\nPremium subscribers met Wall Street expectations of 239 million \u2014 a 14% year-over-year jump. Spotify expects that subscriber count to increase to 245 million in the second quarter.\n\nFree cash flow, another key metric for investors, came in at 207 million euros in the quarter compared to 57 million euros in the year-ago period.\n\nThe average revenue per user, or ARPU, for Premium subscriptions increased 7% to 4.55 euros (or 5% year over year, excluding foreign exchange headwinds.) ARPU was driven by price increase benefits that were partially offset by discounted plans and lower prices in emerging markets, the company said.\n\nProfit pledge\n\nOverall, analysts have been bullish on Spotify after the audio giant pledged to improve its profitability beginning in 2023 on a gross margin and operating income basis.\n\nSpotify stock has surged more than 100% over the past year and is up 43% year to date.\n\nSpotify spent $1 billion pushing into the podcast market over the past four years with splashy A-list deals and $400 million-plus studio acquisitions.\n\nThat spending took a significant bite out of gross margins and weighed heavily on profitability. In response, Spotify committed to several rounds of layoffs \u2014 three in 2023 alone.\n\nSpotify CFO Paul Vogel stepped down from his position on March 31. He will be replaced by Christian Luiga, previously at Swedish aerospace and defense company Saab. Luiga will take over in the third quarter, the company said.\n\nIn addition to layoffs and price increases, Spotify also changed up its royalty structure, made audiobooks free to paying subscribers, and locked in new deals with popular podcasters like Joe Rogan and Alexandra Cooper of \"Call Her Daddy.\"\n\nThe new deals come as Spotify further revamps its podcast strategy to focus more on distribution rather than exclusivity.\n\nThe audio giant announced that Rogan's podcast, its most popular on the platform, will be available on additional services like Apple Podcasts (AAPL), Amazon Music (AMZN), and YouTube (GOOGL) for the first time in years. Spotify will handle distribution and ad sales as it works to maximize revenue. Rogan will receive a guaranteed minimum rate and cut of the advertising revenue.\n\nCooper's \"Call Her Daddy\" deal will have a similar structure with the podcast now available on all major audio platforms after more than two years as a Spotify exclusive. The company will maintain the exclusive rights to the podcast's video portion.\n\nSource: https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/spotify-turns-a-profit-as-earnings-and-revenue-beat-estimates-102727402.html",

    "title": "Amazon (AMZN) DCF Analysis",
    "selftext": "***NOTE NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE***\n\nBefore I start, I should preface by saying that I understand that AMZN is a good stock in general, my post will not be on why AMZN is good. But beyond that, I'd also like to explore whether or not AMZN is over/undervalued, it is possible to be a good stock but still overvalued. \n\n# Introduction:\n\nAMZN has built a strong business model, creating a global logistics network to connect consumers to sellers all over the world. This behemoth of a business inadvertently makes AMZN irreplaceable in our day-to-day life, the convenience and speed at which AMZN offers its services is unparalleled by many companies. Because the company takes a long-term view on returns, it chooses to forfeit short-term gains for longer-term returns. On top of its logistics business, AMZN is also involved in cloud computing the next frontier with large growth potential, all these show the forward-thinking acumen its leaders have.\n\n# Investment Thesis:\n\n***Established Logistics Network***\r  \nAMZN\u2019s most compelling competitive advantage is that it has an established global logistics network that no other company can replicate without substantial monetary and time investment, through controlling its own logistics network by purchasing its own cargo ships and leasing planes ([SOURCE](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/04/how-amazon-beats-supply-chain-chaos-with-ships-and-long-haul-planes.html)). AMZN can control where the ship docks which allows them to be more efficient with their cost through avoiding busy ports. \r  \n\r  \n***Strong Reverse Logistics***\r  \nConsumers increasingly perceive easy & free returns as essential ([SOURCE](https://www.powerreviews.com/research/reduce-returns/)). A very large C.A. for AMZN is its established reverse logistics as evidenced by AMZN being able to offer free return shipping for such a large volume of goods due to them expanding the scale of their reverse logistics that it makes economical sense for them to be able to offer these services for free. AMZN has also increased the ease of returning products, for example, by using UPS stores as a physical retail location where customers can drop off their parcels. UPS is reliant on AMZN as well, accounting for 11% of UPS revenue which gives AMZN large leverage over UPS ([SOURCE](https://www.wsj.com/business/fedex-amazon-discuss-returns-4325af30?st=oo1tomj716vco8d&reflink=article_copyURL_share))\r  \n\r  \nHow retailers manage their reverse logistics is also important as it is an additional outlet of significant revenue source. A few notable strides that AMZN is taking in this front is FBA Grade and Sell, where AMZN grades the item that buyers returned and grades it. Afterward, 3P Sellers (FBA Sellers) set the price based on the condition of the product. \r  \n\r  \n***Branding Goodwill***\r  \nEven though in recent years a few large e-commerce platforms have appeared such as Taobao, Shoppee, and Alibaba. AMZN has managed to maintain its reputation as a place that consumers will turn to if they want to get high-quality, safe, and reliable products that would not be flimsy or poorly made. The main reason why people use Taobao or Alibaba is because it is a website to get quasi items at a fraction of the price ([SOURCE](https://ec4ulimited.com/advantages-disadvantages-taobao-shopping/#:~:text=Goods%20from%20Taobao%20are%20cheap,for%20same%20or%20similar%20items)). Consumers have grown to accept the compromise in quality in exchange for a discount, this may be great in an economic downturn but during an average or booming macro environment, it ends up becoming a disadvantage. On top of that, by competing on price Taobao and Alibaba in the long run is unable to earn much margins and reinvest substantially to grow their business at a pace comparable to AMZN.\n\n# Revenue:\n\n\r***Retail Sales***  \nRetail sales refer to AMZN\u2019s online marketplace and physical stores.   \nAMZN has such large economies of scale that they can offer higher quality products for cheaper. \u201cAmazon prices are 13% cheaper than other retailers for essential items.\u201d ([SOURCE](https://www.grocerygazette.co.uk/2022/11/16/amazon-prices-cheaper-retailer/#:~:text=Amazon%20prices%2013%25%20cheaper%20than%20other%20retailers%20for%20essential%20items,-FMCGNewsSupermarkets&text=Amazon%20prices%20are%20an%20average,a%20new%20study%20has%20revealed)). On top of that, the increasing convenience of AMZN through speedier delivery increases the appeal of AMZN. \u201cmore than 90 percent of consumers expect two- to three-day delivery as the norm, while 30 percent expect same-day delivery.\u201d ([SOURCE](https://www.jpmorgan.com/solutions/treasury-payments/insights/why-shopping-has-changed-forever)).   \nAMZN can achieve higher rates of same-day delivery due to their strategy called \u201cregionalization\u201d, where they store items closer to customers. This results in customers choosing AMZN to deliver their everyday shopping needs as AMZN can get them their items significantly faster. Regionalization also allows AMZN to save on cost which in turn allows AMZN to offer a wider variety of items at a lower Average Selling Price (ASP) profitably. On top of that, AMZN has also released RUFUS an interactive AI model that allows the user to chat with it to get more personalized recommendations based on the consumer's diverse requirements.\n\n  \nAMZN's next frontier of growth comes from India, where it is building out a logistics network to be able to serve rural customers in India. However, AMZN has recently invested heavily in its fulfillment network by doubling it. ([SOURCE](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-doubled-fulfillment-network-since-202622130.html)) So, I assumed that AMZN would slow down growth plans to capitalize on their new fulfillment network fully. India represents a very strong growth opportunity given the high smartphone penetration rate of India, the rapid growth of the Indian economy, and their large population ([SOURCE](https://www.statista.com/statistics/467163/forecast-of-smartphone-users-in-india/)), this culmination of factors makes India a very lucrative market for AMZN to expand in.  \nWhen forecasting Average Monthly Traffic, I took into account ([SOURCE](https://www.sellzone.com/the-state-of-amazon-2022-key-data-insights-trends-to-watch/)). I assumed that as AMZN\u2019s fulfillment network gets more comprehensive their monthly traffic increases as AMZN\u2019s value proposition increases. I assumed that AMZN expands its fulfillment network significantly every 5 years.  \nWhen forecasting Sales/Monthly Traffic, as AMZN begins targeting more price-conscious countries, I assumed that AMZN\u2019s sales/monthly traffic did not grow due to AMZN raising prices and only grew in line with the perpetual inflation rate. However, in the longer run as AMZN becomes more entrenched in these countries\u2019 consumer habits I assumed that AMZN has larger price-setting abilities.   \n\n\n***Third Party Sales (3P)***\r  \nThird Party Sales (3P) refers to the %sales AMZN earns as commission from third party sellers that sell on AMZN\u2019s website. \r  \n\r  \nThe appeal of AMZN to retailers is that retailers can reach a massive audience very easily and can glean valuable insights on their products from the tools that AMZN platforms provide. Listing on AMZN also adds a layer of credibility and convenience, especially for Fulfillment By Amazon (FBA) sellers.\r  \n\r  \nWhen forecasting 3P Gross Merchandise Value, I took into account ([SOURCE](https://www.marketplacepulse.com/articles/amazon-sales-top-700-billion-in-2023)). Opting for less granularity I forecasted GMV as a % of historic averages. As AMZN expands into more markets I expect this GMV to increase as there are now more sellers that are attracted to the services provided by AMZN.\r  \n\r  \nWhen forecasting %GMV Earned, I assumed that AMZN slowly begin taking up a larger portion of the pie as AMZN would build a very strong value proposition to sellers and sellers would grow increasingly reliant on AMZN\u2019s platform. However, I assumed modest growth as AMZN has to remain attractive to sellers by not cutting too much into their margins.\n\n\r  \n***Advertising***  \nAdvertising refers to ad revenue AMZN earns from advertisers to advertise on AMZN\u2019s platform.  \nWhen forecasting Advertising, there is a lack of suitable data to forecast advertising, and the success of advertising hinges on the success of retail. Opting for less granularity I forecasted it as a % of retail revenue.  \n***Subscription***   \nSubscription refers to AMZN\u2019s subscription service, Amazon Prime.  \nWhen forecasting number of subscribers, taking into account ([SOURCE](https://www.yaguara.co/amazon-prime-statistics/#:~:text=There%20are%20230%20million%20Amazon,through%20Prime%20membership%20in%202023)). I believe that NFLX is a very strong competitor having dedicated their entire business model exclusively to content acquisition and marketing compared to AMZN which has a lot of other businesses that they need to pay attention to. I believe a significant portion of subscribers are purchasing Prime Video as an add-on to Amazon Prime rather than just for Prime Video alone. On top of that, in foreign countries where local broadcasters are still in a strong position, it\u2019s tougher for AMZN to break into so I believe that Amazon Prime subscribers will not grow at an aggressive pace. In the past few years, with the backdrop of a poor macro-environment AMZN\u2019s subscribers numbers Y/Y growth rate declined evident that Amazon Prime is perceived as a luxury good or an item placed in low priority.  \nWhen forecasting churn rate, taking into account ([SOURCE](https://churnkey.co/blog/churn-rates-for-streaming-services/)). Opting for less granularity I forecasted it as a % of historic averages. However, I believe that AMZN\u2019s churn rate is higher than it should be due to the influx of new subscribers trying out Amazon Prime for the first time. So, over time I believe that as consumers get used to using Amazon Prime and develop a reliance on the service I believe that the churn rate tends downwards. So I assumed that as AMZN enters into newer markets the value of Amazon Prime increases which incentivizes consumers to stay subscribed to Amazon Prime.   \nWhen forecasting Annual Revenue/Member, as AMZN begins targeting more price-conscious countries, I assumed that AMZN\u2019s Annual Revenue/Member did not grow due to AMZN raising prices in these countries and only in countries where AMZN has an established presence. So, this leads to the overall Y/Y growth rate being slower in the short run.\n\n***AWS***\r  \nAWS refers to AMZN\u2019s cloud computing services. AWS offers SAAS and IAAS.\r  \n\r  \nAWS has a strong first movers advantage, they started in 2006 whereas Google Cloud started in 2008 and Microsoft Azure started in 2010. I believe that AWS has had strong growth in recent history in part due to the chip shortage and a mass rush into AI Training that demanded a lot of chips, causing some companies to resort to renting more cloud GPUs from AMZN.\r  \n\r\n\nAMZN\u2019s Gen AI strategy has 3 layers. The first layer is targetting the training and inference market for AI. The second layer (Amazon Bedrock) offers large numbers of foundational LLM that businesses can use and develop according to their needs, allowing customers to experiment with different models to optimize experience and cost. The third layer is (Amazon Q) which functions similarly to ChatGPT.\r  \n\r  \nOthers\r  \nAMZN\u2019s other revenue sources. \r  \n\r  \nWhen forecasting Others, I forecasted it as a %retail sales as the success of Others hinges on the success of AMZN\u2019s retail arm of business. Opting for less granularity I forecasted it as a % of historic averages.\r\n\n# Reality Check:\n\nAs a reality check for my forecast, I looked at the world\u2019s GDP to figure out if the GMV for AMZN is in line with the total growth in goods and services in the world. As of 2023, AMZN\u2019s GMV as a %World GDP is 0.5%. By 2040, the world GDP is at 153T ([SOURCE](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Global-GDP-could-rise-by-about-12-trillion-in-2040-an-8-percent-increase-mainly-from_fig1_346806184#:~:text=NonCommercial%204.0%20International-,Global%20GDP%20could%20rise%20by%20about%20%2412%20trillion%20in%202040,health%3A%20A%20prescription%20for%20prosperity)), I assumed that AMZN\u2019s GMV as a %world GDP is 1.8%. This is realistic as over time, it would make sense for smaller players to sell their products on AMZN rather than rebuilding a new logistics network from the ground up. An example of smaller players using a much larger platform to sell is live stream commerce, which is prominent on platforms such as Douyin ([SOURCE](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwj8vaCGq4WFAxWO1jgGHaqNBEQQFnoECBMQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.statista.com%2Fstatistics%2F1174906%2Fchina-gmv-of-live-streaming-commerce-on-douyin%2F&usg=AOvVaw1RJ3TKxYD-m8lPZtrTMtRz&opi=89978449)).\r  \n\r  \nThe total world population as of 2023 is at 8.05 billion ([SOURCE](https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/)), and monthly Traffic as of 2023 as a % of the total world population is at 32.92%. By 2043, the world population will grow to 9.36 billion ([SOURCE](https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/world-population-projections/)), I assumed that AMZN\u2019s monthly traffic as a %world population is 49.67%.\r  \n\r  \nI believe that these assessments are realistic given that I am expecting AMZN to expand its logistics network about 6x over 20 years, increasing its reach far beyond its domestic reach in the US. The speed of expansion is logical too given that AMZN was able to double its logistics network 2x over 2 years. \n\n# \rCost:\n\n***COGS***\n\nWhen forecasting COGS, Regionalization has reduced the distance needed by AMZN to deliver their item to customers, in turn saving cost. \r  \n\r  \n***G&A***\n\nWhen forecasting G&A, I took into account the number of employees. AMZN has been reducing headcount over the past few years, as AMZN overhired during COVID-19 to keep up with the raging demand. \r  \n\r  \nWhen forecasting Cost/Employee, as AMZN is in money-saving mode I assumed that they continued the historic trend of cutting down Cost/Employee for the next 2 years before growing in line with the perpetual inflation rate.\r  \n\r  \n***R&D***\n\nWhen forecasting R&D, R&D was capitalized. To determine the useful life I looked at what the majority of the spending was on, \u201cSoftware development costs capitalized were not significant for the years presented.\u201d and  \u201cThe weighted average remaining life of our capitalized video content is 3.5 years.\u201d - 2023 Q4 10-K. So, I assumed that the main expenditure came from capitalized video content, and applying the conservatism principle, the amortization was rounded down to 3 years.\n\n# Change in NWC:\n\nWhen forecasting change in NWC as AMZN recently rolled out their regionalization efforts in FY23, the impact on Day Inventory may be very apparent and should be assumed as the status quo going forward.\n\n# D&A and CapEX:\n\n\rWhen forecasting Amortization and Content Amortization, opting for less granularity I forecasted it as a % of historic averages.\r  \n\r  \nWhen forecasting Content Acquisition and CapEX, I assumed that as AMZN expands its reach the CapEX spending increases before regressing to below historic averages. \n\n# WACC:\n\n\r\u201cThe weighted-average remaining term of the financing obligations was 17.9 years and 17.0 years and the weighted-average imputed interest rate was 3.1% as of December 31, 2022 and 2023.\u201d - 2023 Q4 10-K   \n10Y T-Bond Yield (1M Avg) = 4.31%  \nBeta ([SOURCE](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMZN/)) = 1.17  \nStable Market ERP ([SOURCE](https://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/datafile/ctryprem.html)) = 4.60%  \nCOE = 9.69%  \nAMZN is rated \u201cAA-\u201d ([SOURCE](https://www.fitchratings.com/research/corporate-finance/fitch-affirms-amazoncom-inc-at-aa-outlook-stable-20-06-2023))  \nAA Bond Yield (1M Avg) = 5.03%  \nMarginal Tax Rate = 21.00%  \nAT-COD = 3.97%  \nStock Price (5D Avg) = $173.97  \nShares O/S = 10387.38M  \nMarket Value of Equity = 1807092.50M  \nWeighted Average Maturity = 17.0 Years  \nFY23 Debt Obligation = 67150M  \nInterest Expense = 2081.65M  \nMarket Value of Debt = 60026.19M  \n%Debt = 3.21%  \n%Equity = 96.79%  \n%WACC = 9.48%  \n\n\n# Conclusion:\n\nUltimately, in my base case, I value AMZN at $155.67 per share. I believe that AMZN is still overvalued despite it being a good company. This overvaluation of AMZN is a direct result of AMZN posting high free cash flow in recent quarters which gave investors the confidence that AMZN is capable of deriving positive free cash flow from its business. However, most of this positive cash flow was derived from their high margins AWS and advertising increasing substantially Y/Y. This could mean that positive cash flows are a cyclical occurrence as cloud computing is reliant on the volatile AI market and advertising is a cyclical industry that relies on macro-conditions. I believe that there is a strong case for AMZN to break beyond its current market valuation, but for it to be successful will be dependent on how the Indian market reacts to it and if AMZN is able to restart its push in the China market.\n\nBase Case: \\[[INSERT](https://imgur.com/a/dWsjmqX)\\]  \nBest Case: \\[[INSERT](https://imgur.com/a/WecSUn1)\\]  \nWorst Case: \\[[INSERT](https://imgur.com/a/H3zKhuz)\\]  \nSanity Check: \\[[INSERT](https://imgur.com/a/73hsmlL)\\]  \nRevenue Model: \\[[INSERT](https://imgur.com/a/SemPhpj)\\]  \nRevenue Model Part 2: \\[[INSERT](https://imgur.com/a/lR8X6QO)\\]  \nCost Model: \\[[INSERT](https://imgur.com/a/oqqAydG)\\]  \nChange in NWC Schedule: \\[[INSERT](https://imgur.com/a/r5BJWdh)\\]  \nCapitalised R&D: \\[[INSERT](https://imgur.com/a/9V8QdXp)\\] ",

    "selftext": "This isn't a post about AI bubble or why the chip and cloud hardware supplier is on a nutty uptrend. Their revenue in cases like NVDA has grew 120%+ YoY with insane profit margin, and since market is short sighted, it makes sense why the insane run. Lot of people kicking themselves for not see this coming, or someone like me who saw it coming but exited earlier because couldn\u2019t value the \u201cshovel\u201d correctly in this gold rush.   \nNow lets take a step back and look at this trend from a different angle. Main buyers are the big 5 Google, OpenAI, META, AAPL, AMZN, MSFT (GOMAM).  \nIn order for your you all to understand my next points we all first have to agree on few basic things  \n**1). Companies have FINITE capex amount**  \n**2). Every company at the end of the day WANTS to make money**  \n**3). Every company wants to find a way to REDUCE their capex and still grow**  \nFor point #2, the way these company will eventually make money is by selling the products to consumer and business. So in next 5-10 years we will see leap in software and services innovations. We will see so many new small and midsize companies using these applications to build more complex solutions on cloud. Now take your guess who will benefit the most from this? if your answer is GOMAM, thats correct. If your answer is NVDA then you are an idiot.   \nI would say point #1 and point #3 go hand in hand, we are seeing lot of capex diverted within the company itself. So to no surprise, GOMAM are already building and some have built their own silicon. Its just matter of time when they start to reduce their exposure to external company. This isn\u2019t to say that NVDA will ever become irrelevant. The point is they will always have to outgrow and justify for GOMAM to spend their capex on them. This is the bet you are making for going LONG nvidia at these valuation. Because again, market is short sighted, they are seeing 6-12 month guidance and pumping.  \nNow i am seeing crazy amount of doom and gloom for companies like AAPL and GOOG lately on reddit and also on media. I just have one question, that goes to #2. How do you guys think every software and services that will leverage these new silicon will reach the end users? Think for a second form a consumer standpoint. They don\u2019t know wtf is NVDA, AMD. All they know is smartphones, tablets, wearable, laptops. I am not saying where you should invest your money. I am just saying don\u2019t go with the trend like a madman. if you miss the shovel rush, you can still make plenty of money on factories that will make gold products for end users.   \n**in summary,**   \n**I see there is more value in going long on GOMAAM (Added AAPL) than NVDA,AMD**",

    "title": "I think this year and beyond, Amazon $AMZN will have record cash flow and record stock price, and here is why",
    "selftext": "Background: I am a 3rd party seller who sells private label goods on Amazon. I gross annually between $1-2mil in revenue. At first many sellers and I kind of brushed off this new policy change that was initiated on March 1st, 2024. However once digging deeper into it and making shipments to send into Amazon, I realized how much of a vulture Amazon truly is. As much as I absolutely hate these changes, and I hope FTC investigates the shit out of them, this is extremely bullish for Amazon's cashflow perspective.\r  \n\r  \nhttps://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/headlines.html?id=GF5ST3HMAHRNW2K5&ref=nslp\\_at\\_33\\_GF5ST3HMAHRNW2K5\\_en-US\\_ttl\\_rf\\_recent\\_news\\_34https://www.ecomcrew.com/amazon-fba-big-fee-increase-2024/\r  \n\r  \nAnalysis:\r  \n\r  \nAmazon's recent strategic adjustments are poised to enhance its profitability significantly through the expansion of the Amazon Global Logistics Program and modifications to its Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA) policies. Here's a breakdown of why these changes will benefit Amazon financially:\r  \n\r  \nExpansion of Amazon Global Logistics Program:- What it is: Amazon Global Logistics is a comprehensive shipping and logistics service that facilitates international shipping for sellers on Amazon's platform. It handles cargo from the point of origin to Amazon warehouses worldwide, including sea, air, and land transportation.\r  \n\r  \n\\- Impact: Given that 60-70% of Amazon's third-party sellers are from China, and a substantial portion of private label goods on Amazon are imported from China, the expansion of this program positions Amazon as a key logistics provider for international sellers. By handling sea shipping directly, Amazon eliminates the need to pay third-party shipping companies, thus capturing more revenue from the logistics and shipping process.\r  \n\r  \n\"Voluntary\" Use of Amazon Warehouse Distribution (AWD) for FBA Sellers:\n\n\\- What it is: Amazon's policy now encourages third-party FBA sellers to use its Amazon Warehouse Distribution system, compelling them to store inventory in Amazon's warehouses, which incurs storage fees, inbound fees, and other charges. Amazon will then automatically distribute its inventory to FBA warehouses as it deem fit.\r  \n\r  \n\\- Impact: This move ensures a consistent revenue stream from storage and handling fees paid by sellers. Additionally, sellers are faced with significant penalties for not using AWD, such as high inventory placement fees or the logistical burden of distributing inventory across multiple locations in the USA. (Before this, sellers can usually send all its inventory to one warehouse to save on cost, but that's no longer the case). This strategy not only generates more revenue from fees but also reduces Amazon's costs by shifting the inventory distribution burden to sellers. The average inventory placement cost per box will be about $25-$50. This is absolutely ridiculous.\r  \n\r  \nImplementation of Extra Fulfillment Fees for Low Inventory:\r  \n\r  \n\\- What it is: Amazon has introduced an additional fulfillment fee for sellers who maintain less than 28 days of inventory in Amazon's warehouses. This fee, a minimum of $0.89 per unit, penalizes sellers for not keeping a sufficient stock, especially for high-demand items.\r  \n\r  \n\\- Impact: This policy directly impacts sellers' profit margins, especially for those selling products at lower price points. For example, a $9.99 item with a profit margin of $2, selling 10,000 units a month, this extra charge significantly eats into profits. The intent behind keeping inventory levels lean\u2014to avoid excessive storage fees\u2014now results in additional costs through fulfillment fees.\r  \n\r  \nThis policy effectively forces sellers to either risk running low on inventory and incurring extra fees or overstock to avoid these penalties, leading to higher storage fees. What's even more fucked up about it is that Amazon fulfillment centers usually checks in our shipments late. This means that if I have shipment that was delivered to Amazon Warehouse (Say enough inventory to cover 40 days) but not checked in, and I only have 30 days of inventory left, now I will have to pay extra fee because of \"low inventory\" even though it takes forever for Amazon to process your inventory. I have multiple shipments that's been delivered for about 3 weeks now, and they are still not checked in.\r  \n\r  \n\\- Strategic Benefit for Amazon: By charging extra for fulfillment when inventory levels fall below a certain threshold, Amazon not only generates additional revenue but also pressures sellers to maintain higher inventory levels, thereby increasing the use of Amazon's storage facilities. This policy, combined with the \"voluntary\" use of Amazon's Inventory Placement service for restocking, which incurs additional fees, further ties sellers into Amazon's logistics ecosystem. It incentivizes the use of Amazon's AWD system, underlining Amazon's strategy to centralize control over logistics and distribution, enhancing its revenue streams from logistical and warehousing services while also potentially reducing operational complexities and costs.\r  \n\r  \n\\*\\*Overall Financial Impact:\\*\\*These backend changes significantly reduce operational costs for Amazon by streamlining logistics and warehouse operations. Simultaneously, they increase revenue through logistics services, storage, and handling fees. By centralizing control over logistics and storage, Amazon not only saves on the costs of dealing with external logistics providers but also capitalizes on the fees charged to sellers. This dual approach of cutting costs and boosting revenue streams is poised to enhance Amazon's profitability in the competitive e-commerce and logistics sectors.\r  \n\r  \nAgain, I hope Lina Khan investigates the shit out of Amazon for using this bullshit tactic, but it is what it is. This is going to be extremely bullish for Amazon as it cuts costs while strengthen its global logistics empire.\r  \n\r  \nBonus: Amazon Advertising is also a bunch of bullshit (In terms of as a gigantic cash cow for them). The suggested bids for keywords are usually 2x higher than the actual bid needed to get top spots. This makes uninformed sellers spend a crap on advertising everyday. Just for perspective, I have about 12 products in my private label brand, and I spend on average $300-$500 a day. YES EVERY SINGLE DAY. That's about $110k to $190k a year just in ads. This is extremely high margin business for Amazon because they don't have to do anything. In addition, by Amazon running Ads on most prime video accounts, they will make on average $10/month per user. They also signed deals with NFL to exclusively stream their games. As much as I hate them, the future for Amazon is only up.\r  \n\r  \nExtra bonus: Amazon already handles majority of packages in the US. By a click of a button, they can easily start taking marketshare from both UPS and Fedex by offering shipping to everyday people. They can utilize their wholefoods or kohl's location to receive and ship packages. Or they could also offer franchise opportunities to mom-pop shipping/packaging stores just like how UPS and Fedex has it.\r  \n\r  \nPosition: 20% of my portfolio is now in AMZN. Even at ATH, I plan to change to 50% weighted in Amazon... This is pissing me off, but I gotta find a way to get my money back somehow.",

Right? \n\nIt seemed like the risk to reward was there but I think the moral of the story is: don\u2019t buy garbage companies and expect them to fly up. I have played various other merger plays with good success but this one went against my idea of buying decent companies. **Without the merger, IRBT is still overvalued at current prices.**\n\nIf you are still in this, the risks of blockage are higher than I expected because AMZN isn\u2019t willing to play ball. Also, considering AMZN dropped the acquisition price previously, it is possible they will drop it again due to the massive drop in price recently. Good luck to anyone who is still playing this. \n\nAll and all, lost a good chunk of money, sold, and I\u2019ve learned my lesson: **if you aren\u2019t willing to hold the underlying, don\u2019t buy it just solely for the merger.**",

    "title": "5 Traits of Companies that have Outperformed",
    "selftext": "1. Lower Debt Levels\n\nThe world is uncertain and when things go against you, debt magnifies the negative. Of course it can magnify good things as well, but the data reviewed suggests that the best performers get their without high levels of debt.\n\n2. Higher Growth on a Per Share Basis\n\nIn things like sales, operating cash flow and free cash flows. The per share component is critical because growth at all costs (especially diluting shareholders) hurts performance\n\n3. Higher Gross Margins\n\nHigh gross margins suggest that the company can create something of significant value in excess of competition. For a product company, the inputs to make say a cell phone are all more or less the same, being able to sell far in excess of those same ingredients is an indication of pricing power.\n\n4. Operate in a Capital Efficient Manner\n\nThis helps to ensure low dilution and low debt hold over time. To model this I used Gross Profits / Operating Assets. Operating assets are defined as Total Assets - market investments. \n\n5. Sell at a reasonable Price\n\nEven if you meet the criteria of the other 4 to a high degree, the company is not worth an infinite price. I ranked companies by their Gross Profits / Market Cap.\n\n\nI then plugged this information into Portfolio123. This is back testing software that makes adjustments for when financial data was released (in other words no look ahead bias). I then ranked companies that are part of the Russell 1000 into 10 groups. Higher ranked companies meet more of the criteria mentioned and lesser ranked companies do not meet the conditions mentioned.\n\nThe results: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10UJ3-oVJVzDbh4Xclsfdrs9fbPk-TvM6u1nrK6dBxF4/edit\n\nOther Notes: All data above looks at past financial data that would have been available at the time.\n\nWhy the focus on Gross vs Net Profits? As mentioned, in my view Gross profits may indicate pricing power. Also when dealing with financials in bulk as you move down the income statement the data can get more noisy. For example in the last few years, gains and losses are required to -ass through the income statement even though it doesn\u2019t make economic sense (you can look up the values of these securities on the balance sheet). Also I realized companies make trade offs farther down the income statement that are neither good nor bad but could be screened out if we only looked at operating or net profits. For example for 2 decades AMZN and CRM purposefully invested aggressively and never showed gains in profits despite a torrid growth pace. This was ultimately wise as they gobbled up more market share. Only recently (particularly for CRM) have profits started as revenue growth has slowed and les investment is needed. \n\nI hope you found this useful!",

    "selftext": "I am looking to build a screener that looks at some universal truths of promising companies. Something that when higher/lower it is basically always good. In this post I will argue for the inclusion of some traits and the avoidance of some common ones. Please see below:\n\nWhat makes a promising company?\n\n*Sales, Operating Cash Flow, Free Cash Flow Growth*: if you ain\u2019t growing your dieing.\n\n*High Gross Margins*: indication of significant value add\n\n*Low Debt and Interest Coverage*: this is where risk of a company is. The lower the better, particularly if they are doing well in all the other factors.\n\n*Low Shareholder Dilution*: like debt, if they are doing the other things well but give the company away, that\u2019s no good.\n\nCharacteristics I\u2019d argue against:\n\n*Net Income margin, Operating Income Margin, ROE*: as you get farther down the income statement, more and more can be played with by management. Take AMZN for example. Look at this [chart](https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-revenue-vs-profit-2016-1). AMZN had torrid growth and never grew earnings. Why did the stock go up even though it was and still kinda is a non-profit? They were reinvesting aggressively to fuel that growth ultimately growing their future cash flows more than they otherwise would have been if they showed a profit. Also by not having profits, you minimize taxes. AMZN isn\u2019t the only one to do this, Salesforce did the same [thing](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2018/1/19/saupload_b70533bae99138dbebd44adae05789c8.png).\n\nIt\u2019s not that I think NI, OI and ROE are bad, I am looking for promising companies that are before their maturity.\n\nWith ROE, that tells you where a company is, not where it\u2019s going. Take Colgate, they have an ROE of 500%! Do we think that each incremental investment they make will yield a 500% ROE? of course not. They have been able to replace equity with debt to make the \u201cE\u201d smaller jacking up the ROE.\n\nNI Margin is getting more manipulated with GAAP changes. For example, pass through gain and losses on security investments flow through the income statement. Berkshire is a classic case here.\n\nOI Margin: As mentioned above, companies can purposefully spend more to boost growth and if you have say 60, 70, 80% gross margins, that seems like a great idea. This will mean no profits today, faster growth today, and hopefully a greater ability to harvest profits later.\n\n*What do you think, are there any other universal truths of promising companies?*\n\nThank you for your insights!",

It drives me nuts knowing my index funds hold/held zombie companies like JCPenny, Macy\u2019s, GM, airlines, etc when many of these businesses are obviously not good or have tough futures. They exist, but they ain\u2019t thriving or haven\u2019t thrived in years.\n\nSo I thought, what if i had a basic way to screen out the zombie companies. For me there are a few elements of all businesses that are basically universally good:\n\nSales are growing, shareholders aren\u2019t diluted, debt is low, there are healthy gross margins and valuation is reasonable. I use these elements are to develop a ranking system. That\u2019s it. They can have no or plenty of operating profit, net profit, ROEs, and so on.\n\nMany factor based strategies look for the metrics included above but I feel that is not a great idea. In my view, there are just too many counter examples to focus on \u201cfactors\u201d to make them reliable (AMZN, TSLA, CRM, NOW, etc). Hell a dividend can be interpreted as a sign the company doesn\u2019t have good investment opportunities. And no operating profits (in the case of AMZN/CRM) were the results of aggressive investments in dominating businesses.\n\nI took this theory and ran it in portfolio123 which has controls for backtesting biases and anecdotally looked into a few companies:\n\nA company like Macy\u2019s never qualified in the past 20 years.\n\nNVDA first made the cut in 2015 when it was at $5 or $6 (split adjusted)\n\nKohl\u2019s never made the cut.\n\nDisney would have made it and been kicked out, PayPal still showing great fundamentals despite it\u2019s getting obliterated.\n\nI'd love to hear your thoughts and engage in a discussion about this investment strategy.

Maybe, but remember you can also just upload data to the mainstream ones to give it expertise in what you want quick and efficient knowledge on.\n\nI\u2019d be worried about any tech companies that are \u201cfeatures of AI\u201d not \u201cplatforms of AI tools.\u201d A feature would be \u201cwe have the best mousetrap\u201d a platform is \u201cwe have the best tools to create your mousetrap\u201d and/or \u201cchoose from the highest reviewed mousetraps on our AI store\u201d\n\nEven if you disagree with me on the future of tech, we probably agree that the ability to produce new features and products is now extremely fast for large companies and basic tech start ups given output of these models. This means that the supply of code should increase over time which means more tech companies and competition. This is not good for growth and pricing as more hands try to grab their piece of the admittedly growing market pie.\n\nThe AI platforms leaders as I see it are: OpenAI, MSFT, GOOGL, AMZN, ADBE\n\nPotential Platforms:\nSalesforce (CRM) with their EinsteinAI application and App Store \n\nIBM with their AI tools through Watson \n\nProbably some others\n\nOther comments: \n\nAI is likely to automate many jobs away and replace some of those jobs with jobs we can\u2019t imagine yet. If true legacy companies that price on a per seat basis will be challenged if they don\u2019t pivot to per usage basis. A classic innovators dilemma.",

They have also outperformed all other stocks in terms of growth, profit margins and forward EPS growth, and have stronger balance sheets. \n\nMost analysts expect that the M7 will continue to outperform all other companies until 2025 at least. \n\nNow I know this is a \"stocks\" subreddit but just like the majority of retail investors, a large chunk of my portfolio is alocated to an S&P 500 ETF.\n\nSo I am actually considering instead of DCAing into a broad index ETF, why don't I just DCA into those 7? Maybe even swap META & TSLA since I am not rly a big fan of, with other 2-3 large caps that I favor, like AMD, and ADBE.\n\nShould we expect these 7 to continue outperforming the rest of the world? Should we consider cyclicality? There's no doubt that all 7 of these companies are leaders and are probably not going anywhere in the near future.

    "selftext": "Microsoft stock reached a new all-time closing high\u2014but there could be some hiccups ahead in the short term.\r  \n\r  \nMicrosoft's stock rose 1.1% to $360.53 on Tuesday. That's a new closing high, topping the previous high of $359.49 set on July 18. Furthermore, Microsoft has won for eight days in a row, its longest winning streak since January 28, 2021.\r  \n\r  \nThe stock has been helped by the company\u2019s strong earnings and sales, which got a boost from the Azure cloud business.\r  \n\r  \nBut it\u2019s not just earnings. Microsoft was already outperforming its peers following tech weakness in August and September. Its stock has gained 15% since the end of September, outpacing Amazon.com (AMZN), which has risen 12%, Meta Platforms (META), which has risen 6.5%, Nvidia (NVDA) and Apple (AAPL), which is up 6%, Alphabet (GOOGL) which has ticked up 0.3%, and Tesla (TSLA), which has dropped 13%.\r  \n\r  \nSo, why be concerned? It all comes down to the 14-day relative strength index from Microsoft. The RSI, or Relative Strength Index, is a measure of a stock's or index's momentum, or lack thereof. The closer it comes to 20 on the negative, the more oversold it is, while a score close to 80 indicates that the stock is extremely overbought. A value below 30 usually indicates that a stock is about to rally, while a score above 60 indicates a likely decline. Microsoft's RSI is at 72.75, indicating that it is becoming quite overbought and that a pullback is possible.\r  \n\r  \nThat doesn\u2019t mean Microsoft isn\u2019t worth buying for its long-term potential. The company has a lot to recommend, including a cloud business that should get a boost as ChatGPT, which held its developer conference yesterday, looks to expand. It just means that investors might get a better opportunity to pick up shares in the days ahead.\r  \n\r  \n",

Here are a few of them with why I bought: \n\nTGT \\[Target\\] = Target has its problems such as organized theft like most chain stores do. Target also has its base of customers that want to shop there and nowhere else. Looking the last 10 years over it usually performs well between September and January, about 70% of the time (some of its best runs came from fall - late winter). \n\nW \\[Wayfair\\] = Wayfair has its base of customers that are loyal to it. Although it had a boom and bust cycle from 2020 until now due to COVID restrictions going from being a thing to not anymore - I see this stock as a good play for the next 6 months. People are still moving (upper middle class) and finding new jobs, many that require relocation. People who helped pump W to go over 10X in 2020 are the same people who will buy things from them during the holiday season, if they move hundreds of miles away, etc. \n\nORCL \\[Oralce\\] = They are a powerhouse of a company - the small caps cannot compete, and I am unaware of a single company that I've used who has stopped using them to use another product. Seems oversold (for those who know about charts - it has a double top). [https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=ORCL&p=d](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=ORCL&p=d) \n\nNG \\[Novagold Resources Inc.\\] = The price of gold the last few weeks has plummeted 5%, and it has for no reason. A company that I like is NG and they report earnings next week. They have a multiple bottom in their charts for chart people.

Workers will get at least CPI.  If higher than 3.5% minimum that amount and council will determine pay.\n* The California minimum wage for fast-food workers is on track to rise to $20 an hour next April.\n* The pay hike is part of deal between the restaurant industry and labor groups over controversial legislation in California.\n* Tickers mentioned in article CMG, YUM, QSR, MCD, DPZ, AMZN, TGT, WMT\n\n-----------------\n\nFast-food workers in California are set to receive pay hikes next year after the restaurant industry and unions reached a compromise over a controversial bill.\n\nThe deal, brokered with the help of Gov. Gavin Newsom\u2019s office, also creates a nine-person council that will decide on future wage hikes for the fast-food industry in California through 2029. The agreement ends a fight between the two sides that threatened to stretch out for years. The restaurant industry was gearing up to spend more than $100 million on the battle.\n\nThe deal will mean a wage floor of $20 for California workers at fast-food chains with at least 60 locations nationwide, starting April 1. And from 2025 through 2029, the appointed council will have the authority to raise the hourly minimum wage annually by whichever is lower: 3.5% or the annual change in the consumer price index.\n\nThe council will include four representatives from the fast-food industry, four from the workers\u2019 side and one neutral party who will serve as chair.\n\nWhile fast-food operators will have to cope with paying higher wages, the agreement thwarts more dire consequences, according to industry analysts.\n\n\u201cI certainly wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s catastrophic, and certainly not as bad as it could have played out over the next year or two,\u201d said Mark Kalinowski, CEO of Kalinowski Equity Research.\n\nCalifornia lawmakers rushed to conclude the matter before the legislative session ends midnight Friday. The state senate passed the bill Thursday, and the state assembly has concurred with the upper house\u2019s amendments. Newsom, a Democrat, has already pledged to sign the bill into law.\n\n**California\u2019s fast-food fight**\n\nNewsom signed AB 257, also known as the FAST Act, into law in January. The legislation would have created a 10-person council that would govern fast-food chains with more than 60 locations, including setting guidelines for working conditions and wages. The initial wage hike could have been as high as $22 an hour.\n\nBut the fast-food industry was attacking the bill before it even made its way to Newsom\u2019s desk. State records show that Chipotle Mexican Grill, Chick-fil-A, Yum Brands and Restaurant Brands International were among the chains that spent money to lobby California lawmakers to oppose the legislation.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s U.S. President Joe Erlinger wrote a letter posted on the company\u2019s website, making a rare public statement on a political issue. Erlinger called the bill \u201clopsided\u201d and \u201cill-considered,\u201d attacking lawmakers for not targeting all restaurants. As of 2022, just under 10% of McDonald\u2019s U.S. restaurants were located in California, according to Citi Research. Most are run by franchisees.\n\nThe restaurant industry retaliated, gathering enough signatures to create a referendum that would make California\u2019s voters decide on the matter. The Service Employees International Union, which backed the FAST Act, alleged in a lawsuit that the industry misled signatories, but a judge ruled against the union. The referendum was supposed to be on November 2024 ballots.\n\nIn response to the referendum, the SEIU backed another bill, AB 1228. The bill would impose joint-employer liability on franchised businesses \u2014 including the very restaurant chains that loudly decried AB 257.\n\nUnder the bill, franchisors like McDonald\u2019s would be held liable for infractions committed by their franchisees. Opponents said that the bill attacked the very nature of the franchising model. AB 1228\u2032s provisions were originally included in AB 257 but removed before Newsom signed it into law.\n\nThe California State Assembly passed AB 1228 in early June. But the state\u2019s Senate never had the chance to vote on that version.\n\nInstead, the restaurant industry and the unions struck a deal, replacing the joint-employer provisions with the terms of their agreement, which also includes repealing the FAST Act and withdrawing the referendum by Jan. 1.\n\n**What\u2019s next for workers?**\n\nFast-food workers employed by affected restaurants will see pay increases of as much as 25% hit their paychecks starting in April. The current California minimum wage is $15.50 an hour, with a bump to $16 set for January.\n\nEmployees of smaller fast-food joints and other restaurants could also reap some benefits from the legislation.\n\n\u201cWhen you look at the $20 minimum wage, that\u2019s a bar that\u2019s being set,\u201d Joe Pawlak, managing principal of restaurant consulting firm Technomic, told CNBC. \u201cThat\u2019s going to make the restaurant industry a lot more competitive for employees, so other industries are going to have to also step up.\u201d\n\nIn recent years, Amazon warehouses and retailers like Walmart and Target have lured workers away with higher hourly pay. Now they\u2019ll be forced to compete with fast-food chains, which have traditionally been slower to raise wages due to operators\u2019 razor-thin margins.\n\nOther states, like Minnesota or New York, could also follow California\u2019s lead and craft similar councils to govern restaurants or other industries, Pawlak said.\n\n\u2033[The deal] puts a model in place with a structure that everybody is able to digest,\u201d he said.\n\nStill, labor\u2019s side had to make some trade-offs to get the deal in California. One key concession is that the council won\u2019t have the power to set working conditions. Instead, the Fast Food Council will only be able to recommend proposed standards to state agencies.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean that unions won\u2019t keep trying to push for better conditions.\n\n\u201cFast-food workers\u2019 fight in California isn\u2019t close to over \u2014 it has only just begun as they prepare to take their seat at the table and help transform their industry for the better,\u201d SEIU President Mary Kay Henry said in a statement to CNBC.\n\n**What does it mean for restaurants?**\n\nFaced with a mandate to pay higher wages, fast-food operators will have to decide how they plan to deal with elevated labor costs. Some may raise menu prices, although customers may balk at having to foot the bill. Others may try to make do with fewer workers on hand or to invest in automation to handle more tasks.\n\nBut it\u2019s not all gloomy for restaurants.\n\n\u201cThis agreement protects local restaurant owners from significant threats that would have made it difficult to continue to operate in California. It provides a more predictable and stable future for restaurants, workers, and consumers,\u201d Sean Kennedy, executive vice president of public affairs at the National Restaurant Association, said in a statement.\n\nThe chief uncertainty resolved by the deal is the referendum slated for November 2024 ballots. The industry had already spent more than $64 million on the referendum, according to California records, and was preparing to spend much more. But it would be difficult to predict which side voters would take.\n\n\u2033[The agreement] shows just how concerned the industry was,\u201d Kalinowski said. \u201cThe referendum would have been very challenging, to have it come out their way.\u201d\n\nOn top of that, restaurant chains like In-N-Out now save some cash that otherwise would have gone toward the industry\u2019s war chest.\n\nThe deal also avoids the change to joint-employer liability that was feared by the broader franchising industry.\n\n\u201cThis allows the franchise model to exist,\u201d said Dana Kravetz, a Los Angeles-based labor attorney at Michelman & Robinson.\n\nFast-food companies with heavily franchised footprints, like McDonald\u2019s, KFC, Taco Bell and Domino\u2019s Pizza, will largely escape the effects of the bill, unless they have company-owned locations in California.\n\nInstead, their franchisees will have to grapple with how to pay higher wages. The National Owners Association, an independent advocacy group of McDonald\u2019s franchisees, plans to push back. In a memo viewed by CNBC, the NOA projects the bill will cost each restaurant in the state $250,000 annually.\n\nRestaurant companies that don\u2019t franchise will have to foot the bill for increased labor costs themselves. That includes Chipotle Mexican Grill, which has 457 locations \u2014 or 14% of its total footprint \u2014 in its home state of California.",

    "selftext": "Hey all, I retired recently at age 55 and have been pondering about my investment strategy for the coming years. Specifically, I'm caught between rebalancing my current tech-heavy portfolio, adding AAPL to the mix, or just simplifying life by moving everything into QQQ. \n\nThis particular portfolio makes up around 30% of my total retirement savings, and I plan to start drawing it down slowly in about 2 years.\r  \n\r  \nMy Current Portfolio\n\n\r  \nMSFT: \\~75%\r  \nAMZN: \\~9%\r  \nNVDA: \\~8%\r  \nTSLA: \\~6%\r  \nGOOG: \\~1%\r  \nSome Context:\r  \nI earned my MSFT shares during my career there and am pretty bullish on their future, hence the big slice of the pie they occupy. I added the TSLA in 2016 and sold a few when it had a big gain but again I'm bullish on them. Most of the stocks have been held for at least 3 years.\r  \n\r  \nSo, what are your thoughts?\r  \n\r  \nShould I rebalance these existing stocks?\r  \nShould I consider adding AAPL to diversify a bit within the tech sector?\r  \nOr should I just move it all into QQQ for ease of management?\n\n\r  \nJust seeking opinions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf I don't simplify now I will need to in the coming years. I have a couple of years of cash equivalents available and will rebalance annually.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm not keen to just put it all in in an S&P tracker or whatever as I believe tech will out perform for the foreseeable future. Also much of the rest of my retirement fund is well diversified in managed funds I can't touch yet due to tax/age.\r  \n\r  \nCheers!\r  \n\r  \n",

    "selftext": "My mother recently passed away, and I inherited two Fidelity accounts that she had. One of the accounts was her IRA account. The other was an individual investment account. After taking a look at both of them, I realized that she has a ton of money in bonds. This made sense for someone her age, but for me, I'd like to completely revamp these accounts since I'm 32 years with a much higher risk tolerance. \n\n\nShe also has a ton of different individual stocks (over 70 different individual stocks) that I'd like to consolidate and use mostly ETFs instead. I will post my portfolio plan of action below. My main question is, should I be focusing mainly on ETFs that are dividend driven for the IRA account? While focusing mainly on non-dividend ETFs for my investment account? I know that with IRA accounts, you do not get taxed on dividends as yearly income like you would for investment accounts. I plan on buying the following ETFs for my investment account.\n\n\n50% VOO (ETF)- Vanguard 500 Index Fund - 500 largest companies.\n\n15% VTI (ETF)- Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund - Overall stock market.\n\n10% AVUV (ETF)- Avantis US Small Cap Value -  US small-cap.\n\n10% QQQ (ETF) - Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 - Invesco QQQ - Technology, NASDAQ top 100....Apple, Google, Microsoft, ect.\n\n10% Individual Stocks - NVDA, META, AAPL, AMZN, MCD, TSLA, SHOP, etc.\n\n5% XXUS (ETF)- VXUS-Vanguard Total International Stock ETF - ETF with international exposure.\n\n\n\nShould I approach my IRA account any differently?

    "title": "Wouldn't it be much more logical to swing trade in Roth IRA's and long-term hold in regular accounts instead of the exact opposite?",
    "selftext": "Wait a second before you have a meltdown over this. Hear me out, then tell me that I'm a dumbass.\n\nIt's my belief that most people turn into the Boglehead types over time because of their experiences with paying taxes on short-term capital gains and long-term capital gains. Newer investors don't have the experience with dealing with their taxes as much, so they tend to swing for the fences with shorter-term positions.\n\nMore seasoned investors tend to buy and hold, but this is a learned behavior because they know that their absolute worst case tax scenario on a long-term gain is 20 percent (federally). Of course, you only pay the 20 percent on long-term cap gains if you're income is over like 492k or something. Most end up paying about 15 percent federal tax on their long-term cap gains. Short-term cap gains seem to be taxed almost double that amount, obviously it depends on your exact tax bracket situation, but you get the point.\n\nThus, it's been beaten into the heads of seasoned investors that it's just smarter in the long run to hold positions for at least a year, because your tax bill is often cut in half, or almost in half. You do this long enough, and it becomes ingrained in your investing personality.\n\nAll of this makes perfect sense to me.\n\nOk, now let's talk about Roth IRA's. With Roth IRA's, if you're doing things correctly, there's ZERO taxes on your earnings when you're taking your money out. Obviously you need to be 59 1/2 years old and you need to have passed the 5-year rule, etc., etc.\n\nBut if ultimately there's no tax implications whatsoever for investments that are under the Roth umbrella, why do most people tend to hold things for the long-term, and be ultraconservative?\n\n**WAIT!**\n\nI already know what you're going to say, but I'm going to argue that it's nonsensical. You're going to say because Roth IRA's are designed for retirement, and when you get up to that age you should be a lot more risk adverse, because you really need this money for your retirement and you can't be screwing around, taking penitentiary chances.\n\nHowever, here's my argument to that. Consider all of your investments, Roth and normal brokerages as this large bucket of water. Most ~~people~~ investors will have a Roth account and a regular brokerage account. Due the limitations on how much you can get into a Roth each year, it's likely that most people will have at least 5 to 6 times as much money in their regular brokerage accounts as their Roth accounts. For example.... Imagine somebody has 50k grand total in various Roth accounts. Maybe a standard issue Roth and a 401k Roth. But they have 250k in a \"normal\" brokerage account.\n\nIn this scenario, less than 17 percent of their overall investment money is in their Roth. So, the argument that they need to be ULTRA CAREFUL WITH THEIR ROTH MONEY is pretty illogical, because it's such a small percentage of their overall scenario.\n\n**Wouldn't it be tremendously more logical to actually trade that 17 percent of their account more aggressively, when it's the only 17 percent that isn't negatively affected by moving in and out of stocks?**\n\nThink about the guy that has Microsoft stock. Been holding MSFT for years. He knows the ups and downs. The peaks and valleys. He can probably tell you countless times he would have taken profits if only there wasn't a major tax consequence. So, he doesn't take profits when the stock gets ahead of itself, and then buy back in during a retracement. But his reasoning is tax implications. Inside a Roth, there's no tax implications. Thus, this same investor could sell out of MSFT when he thinks it's gotten ahead of itself, and then buy back in during a retracement and end up with more overall shares. All with no taxable implications whatsoever.\n\nNow obviously, nobody can predict the future and sometimes people are going to get it wrong. They'll sell MSFT when they think the stock has gotten way ahead of itself and then it continues to go on a tear and now he can't buy back in and still have the same number of shares.\n\nBut by the same token, just talk to any Amazon investor over the last three years. That shit has basically gone pretty much nowhere for a three-year period. So the whole buy and hold forever strategy hasn't worked out that great for AMZN holders. \n\nIt cuts both ways. Don't just cherry pick the example of it hurting.",

The major three indices, the S&P 500, the Nasdaq 100, and the Dow, inched 0.1% higher, while small caps in the Russell 2000 outperformed by rising 0.9%.

Notably, however, Tuesday brings us into August, which has been the weakest month of the year over the last 25 years.\n\n[**Broadening of the market.**](https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/Cj8RJI9cSQHXtbHDpHlEqQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTcwNQ--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-07/134ad610-2fe2-11ee-bf6f-1ffefac75b64)\n\nIn the table above, we can see that the three leading sectors until May were those that house the so-called Magnificent Seven stocks, as well as the growthier names that tend to be less cyclical.\n\nThe Tech sector is home to much of the artificial intelligence trade, including Microsoft (MSFT) and Nvidia (NVDA). Apple (AAPL), which is up some 50% so far this year, is also a member of the Tech sector.\n\nAlphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), along with Meta Technologies (META), is a member of the Communication Services sector.\n\nAnd even with the rally broadening in recent months, we can see Tech is still doing a lot of the heavy lifting. It may not be a surprise, then, to learn that both Apple and Meta have been positive each month this year. (For Meta, the streak of monthly wins extends all the way back to November 2022.)\n\nThrough May, Amazon (AMZN) and other e-commerce plays were primarily responsible for boosting gains in the Consumer Discretionary sector.\n\nIn the two months since, brick and mortar stalwarts like Kohl's (KSS) and Nordstrom (JWN) have joined the rally, with each up over 50% since the end of May.\n\nCyclical names \u2014 whose fortunes vary more alongside the state of the economy \u2014 dominate the components of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI).\n\nAnd inside the index we can also see the game of catch-up taking place.\n\nThe latest returns from June to July are reflected on the x-axis in the chart below, while prior gains through May are expressed vertically on the y-axis.\n\nIndustrial giant Caterpillar (CAT) is alone at the right edge of the chart \u2014 up 29% the last two months after sinking 14% earlier this year. Caterpillar will report earnings on Tuesday.\n\n3M (MMM) and Boeing (BA) are also among top recent returns, while rounding out the top five are banking giant JPMorgan (JPM) and retail leader Home Depot (HD).\n\nAlso noteworthy are the few laggards that haven't mustered much the entire year and are camping out in the lower left of the chart.\n\nConsumer Staples (XLP) company Walgreens (WBA) happens to be dead last on the year-to-date list, down 20%.

    "title": "Nasdaq 100 Plans Special Rebalance To Curb Dominance Of 'Magnificent Seven' (apple, meta, google, Microsoft, Tesla..)",
    "selftext": "From https://www.investors.com/news/nasdaq-100-plans-special-rebalance-to-curb-dominance-of-magnificent-seven/\n\n\n\nThe Nasdaq 100 index is set to adjust the weighting of its 100 components, with the \"magnificent seven\" stocks Microsoft (MSFT), Apple, Nvidia (NVDA), Tesla (TSLA), Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL), Meta Platforms (META) and Amazon.com (AMZN) currently accounting for more than half the index's weight.\n\nThe magnificent seven stocks largely fell Monday.\n\nThe Nasdaq 100 special rebalance will take place before the market open on Monday, July 24, to \"address overconcentration in the index by redistributing the weights.\"\n\nThe weighting changes will be announced on Friday, July 14. No stocks will be added or removed.\n\nThe Nasdaq 100 includes the 100 largest non-financial Nasdaq components.\n\n\nHow Is the Nasdaq 100 Weighted?\nThe Nasdaq 100 index is a modified market-capitalization index. Market valuation is the largest factor, but with methodology to limit overconcentration.\n\nThe seven-largest companies in the Nasdaq 100 account for 55% of the index. It seems likely that this combined weighting will be reduced. It's also likely that there may be notable weighting shifts within these seven giants.\n\nThe current weights show that market capitalization is the dominant factor, but it's not the only one.\n\nMicrosoft stock has the largest weight, at 12.9%, as of July 7. Apple stock has a 12.5% weight, despite having a $2.999 trillion market cap vs. Microsoft's $2.51 trillion.\n\nGoogle stock has a 7.4% weighting with the GOOGL and GOOG share classes combined.\n\nNvidia stock has vaulted to a 7% Nasdaq 100 weighting, thanks to its $1.05 trillion market cap. That's a slightly larger weight than Amazon stock (6.9%), even though the latter has a significantly higher valuation at $1.33 trillion.\n\nTesla stock and Meta Platforms round out the top-seven members, with weights of 4.5% and 4.3%, respectively.\n\nJust for reference, for the entire Nasdaq composite, Apple stock had an 11.4% weighting as of July 7 while Microsoft was at 9.5%. GOOGL stock is at 5.8% while Amazon and Nvidia are at 5.1% and 4%, respectively. TSLA stock has 3.3% share and META stock is at 2.8%.\n\nHow Much Will Nasdaq 100 Megacaps Be Cut?\nBased on Nasdaq 100 methodology, the combined weight of the five companies with the largest market caps will be set to 38.5%. The five-largest companies, Apple, Microsoft, Google, Amazon and Nvidia had a combined weight of 46.7%. That suggests some notable reduced weightings for these names.\n\nMeanwhile, no component outside the top-five market cap companies can have a Nasdaq 100 exceeding the lesser of 4.4% or the weight of the stock with the fifth-largest market valuation. That points to at least a slight decline in TSLA stock's weight.\n\nThe official reweightings should be released on Friday, perhaps after the close. That will also include stocks that will see increased weightings.\n\nMagnificent Seven Soar In 2023\nThe Invesco QQQ ETF (QQQ), which tracks the big-cap Nasdaq index, was up 37.5% in 2023 through July 7. The First Trust Nasdaq 100 Equal Weighted Index ETF (QQEW), which gives an equal weight to all 100 stocks, is up just 18.8%.\n\nThis largely reflects massive moves by megacaps this year. NVDA stock has nearly tripled (191%). META stock has soared 141% while TSLA stock is up 123%. AMZN stock has leapt 54.5%. AAPL stock has run up 47% and MSFT stock nearly 41%. Google stock is up a still-robust 35%.\n\nThere is some concern that this handful of names is distorting the health of the overall stock market, which is likely what's spurring the special rebalancing.\n\nWill Nasdaq 100 Special Rebalance Affect Stock Prices?\nThe Nasdaq 100 special rebalance will spur stock allocation shifts among ETFs such as QQQ and mutual funds that track the index. So there could be some one-off gains or losses, perhaps as the planned changes are announced on July 14.\n\nHowever, the impacts may be modest. For one, the big-cap Nasdaq index is going to adjust weightings, vs. a full addition or deletion. Also, far more money tracks the S&P 500, which is why S&P 500 component changes get a lot more attention than Nasdaq 100 moves.\n\nThe S&P 500 index, unlike the Nasdaq 100, is a pure market-cap weighted index.\n\nMost of the \"magnificent 7\" stocks retreated Monday. Nvidia stock fell just 0.8%, while Apple slipped 1.1%. more than 1% intraday. Microsoft stock retreated 1.6%, TSLA 1.8% and Amazon 2%. GOOGL stock sank 2.5%.\n\nThe one exception: META stock climbed 1.2%, as Meta's new Threads app topped 100 million sign-ups in less than a week.\n\nMegacaps weighed on the Nasdaq 100, which fell intraday before eked out a gain. The equal-weight QQEW jumped 1.8%.",

    "selftext": "I've been trading for a couple of years and lately I've been doing very well by paying attention to relationships and divergences among stocks/ETFs/commodities. Trying to understand and exploit the ebb and flow among sectors. Attempting to identify where long-term accumulation is taking place. First and foremost I watch SPY/QQQ/IWM, ES/NQ/RTY, VIX/VX, DXY/USD, and the 10Y. I also watch the SPDR Sector Funds like XLK, XLF, XLV, XLU, XLY, XLE, XLP, XBI, etc. Additionally, IWC (micro-caps) and IJH (mid-caps). \n\nAnd VTI (whole stock market ETF) and VT (whole world market ETF) I watch on the weekly chart to get a sense for where the world markets are trending in general. I haven't branched into other markets much, mainly focused on identifying \n\n1) where the current strength in the market is \n\n2) whether the market is remaining orderly/non-volatile \n\n3) how much divergence is taking place among sectors/stocks (e.g. last year felt like indiscriminate selling, this year the divergences are tremendous)\n\nFor individual stocks, I basically rifle through stocks with setups that interest me and I really lack organization for what I have on my charts during a trading day. I use Thinkorswim and typically have about 20 charts up across 3 monitors. It's been a challenge to manage my screen real estate and I still change things up all the time, haven't found a solid methodology I guess for what I have pulled up. Undoubtedly what you have pulled up can effect what you trade, how you perceive the market throughout the day, etc. \n\nA lot of times I have AAPL, TSLA, GOOG, AMZN, up at all times. From there I have a mix of stocks from other sectors, maybe a couple wildcards like a small cap/squeeze name. But generally my goal is to display to myself options that I'm unlikely to be severely wrong on, or end up taking a big loss on. I go through and adjust what I'm looking to every night, but admittedly I do need more organization, journaling, and operating more systematically.  \n\nSo what is your process for evaluating the market? Discovering stocks and setups. What do you have open during the trading day? How many charts? Do you purposefully limit what you see? Do you use any websites/tools to organize your watchlist(s)? Give me your wisdoms",

    "selftext": "Cathie Wood often invests in speculative companies with profits that are years away, though Tesla (TSLA) has been profitable for years. So has Shopify (SHOP), a top-10 Ark Invest holding. Thanks to a strategic shift, Shopify earnings growth is expected to skyrocket in 2023, with strong gains continuing next year. And SHOP stock is near a buy point.\n\n  \n**Shopify Logistics Sale**  \nShopify announced the sale of its fulfillment business to privately held Flexport on May 4, with the deal closing in June. The e-commerce software giant in recent years had sought to challenge Amazon.com (AMZN) in third-party fulfillment for online orders. But it turned out to be an \"expensive experiment.\"  \nShopify now holds a 13% stake in Flexport, but exiting logistics will mean the company can slash costs. Meanwhile, gross merchandise growth is picking up after slowing sharply following the coronavirus pandemic boom.\n\n**Shopify Earnings**\r  \nShopify earnings plunged to 4 cents a share in 2022 from 64 cents in 2021. The end of the pandemic meant a big slowdown in e-commerce growth.\r  \n\r  \nFirst-quarter earnings, reported May 4 along with the Flexport deal, tumbled 50% vs. a year earlier. Sales grew 25% to $1.51 billion.\n\n**Shopify Earnings**\r  \nShopify earnings plunged to 4 cents a share in 2022 from 64 cents in 2021.

Sales grew 25% to $1.51 billion.\n\n**SHOP Stock**\r  \nShopify stock gapped up 24% on May 4 following first-quarter earnings and the Flexport deal, blasting out of a cup-with-handle base. After peaking at a 52-week high of 65.54 on May 10, shares began to consolidate. SHOP stock briefly broke out to a fresh 52-week high in mid-June, but pulled back with the broader market.\r  \n\r  \nThis Cathie Wood stock has once again found support at the 21-day line. Investors could still use 65.64 as a place to start or add to a Shopify stock position. The risks would be elevated if the market pullback is still ongoing.\n\n**Ark Invest Stake**\r  \nArk Invest owns 0.68% of Shopify stock as of June 26. It's the 8th-largest holding across Cathie Wood's Ark ETFs, with a 3.85% weight overall.\r  \n\r  \nWhile SHOP stock has been a big winner for Ark Invest in 2023, its current position is still underwater. The ARKK, ARKW and ARKF funds have an average cost of $121.32-$128.27.\r  \n\r  \nThat's not uncommon. Ark Invest has a big profit in its current Tesla stock holdings. But the other top-10 Cathie Wood stock positions are losers right now, with some more than 75% below Ark's cost basis.\n\n[https://www.investors.com/news/cathie-wood-stock-top-ark-invest-stock-expected-to-deliver-772-earnings-growth/](https://www.investors.com/news/cathie-wood-stock-top-ark-invest-stock-expected-to-deliver-772-earnings-growth/)\n\n&#x200B;",

    "title": "Tesla just turned a huge financial burden into a $12.9 billion revenue opportunity.",
    "selftext": "* Tesla recently added two of the world's largest carmakers to its EV charging network.\n* Just weeks later, more automobile manufacturers are making -- or considering -- the move.\r\n* Some investors are viewing this as an opportunity comparable to Amazon's rollout of AWS.\n\n# \rThe electric vehicle maker might be having an \"AWS moment.\"\n\nThe past couple of years have been a bumpy ride for Tesla (TSLA). After rocketing to an all-time high in late 2021, the stock plunged more than 70% in the face of high inflation, rising interest rates, and the worst stock market downturn in more than a decade. But the tide appears to have turned over the past several months. Since bottoming in early January, Tesla shares have been on fire, gaining 149% as of this writing.  \nWhat caused this epic run? A rebound in the stock market and the recovering economy were no doubt contributors, but the biggest gains have come over the past few weeks in the wake of a few historic announcements. Several big-name automakers have ceded the high ground, joining the Tesla Supercharger network and adopting its North American Charging Standard (NACS) connector, which is now on the road to becoming the industry standard on the continent.  \nThis stampede of partnerships prompts the question: Is Tesla having an \"AWS moment\"?\n\n# The agreements driving Tesla stock higher\n\n\rLate last month, Ford announced that beginning early next year, Ford electric vehicle (EV) owners would gain access to more than 12,000 Tesla charging stations across the U.S. Ford's chief customer officer, Marin Gjaja, cited Tesla's \"large, reliable and efficient charging system\" as the incentive.\r  \n\r  \nJust weeks later, General Motors announced that it, too, would join the Tesla Supercharger network. On Tuesday, Rivian jumped on the bandwagon, joining the company's North American network, while Hyundai is considering a similar move. \n\nIn each case, the automakers have noted that after initially requiring an adapter, they would equip future EVs with an NACS charge port within the next couple of years, eliminating the need for adapters going forward.\n\n# \r\rThe cloud connection\n\n\rBack in 2000, Amazon (AMZN) was hamstrung by a number of growth-related issues, the biggest being the ability to scale its nascent operations. To address this challenge, the company developed a cloud infrastructure system that would form the foundation for its growing e-commerce business.\r  \n\r  \nAt the time -- and unbeknownst to Amazon executives -- the company had planted the seeds that would eventually become Amazon Web Services (AWS), its lucrative cloud computing service. After being used solely by Amazon employees for several years, the service debuted to the public in early 2006, and the company began renting out the cloud infrastructure it originally developed for in-house use. And the rest -- as they say -- is history. \r  \n\r  \nAWS quickly become one of Amazon's most lucrative enterprises, a paradigm that continues to this day. In 2022, AWS generated revenue of more than $80 billion, up 29% year over year. More importantly, the cloud computing business was responsible for just 15% of Amazon's total revenue but all of its operating income -- even subsidizing the losses from its e-commerce operations. \n\nThe company is still the leader in the cloud business it pioneered, closing out the first quarter with a 32% share of the cloud infrastructure market, which is as much as the shares of Microsoft and Alphabet combined, according to data supplied by research firm Canalys. \r  \n\r  \nThe parallel here is clear. Tesla originally developed the Supercharger network solely for use by its customers, but it appears to be transforming into a lucrative industry standard.\n\n# AWS moment?\n\n\rThe ability to take a substantial business costs and turn them into a hefty revenue generator is a rare thing, which is why some are calling this Tesla's \"AWS moment.\" Wedbush analyst Dan Ives is one such commentator. He notes that while the company is known for accelerating EV adoption around the globe, Tesla's Supercharger network is the hidden gem that will take the company -- and its stock -- to the next level: \r  \n\r  \nI believe \"what has changed\" for the Street over the last month is the recognition with the Ford and GM supercharger partnerships that Tesla's sum-of-the-parts valuation is now finally starting to get tapped into. This reminds us of when the Street started to realize the margin story and valuation at AWS for Amazon.\r  \n\r  \nHe goes on to estimate that the pacts with Ford and GM could add another $3 billion to Tesla's EV charging revenue \"over the next few years.\"\r  \n\r  \nPiper Sandler agrees and is more precise in its estimates, estimating that charging from non-Tesla customers could add $3 billion to revenue by 2030, surging to $5.4 billion by 2032. A greater number of EVs on the road -- from numerous automakers -- will no doubt accelerate this \"flywheel effect,\" enriching Tesla and its shareholders along the way. \r  \n\r  \nThe company is also vying for roughly $7.5 million in subsidies offered by the Biden administration to expand its Supercharger network if other automakers have access to its system. In all, this amounts to nearly $13 billion in additional financial incentives for Tesla to open up its network. \r  \n\r  \nIt's also worth noting that Tesla also has a significant advantage over its rivals with one of the most cost-effective chargers in the business. The company has been able to construct charging stations for as little as $42,000 per connector, compared to a range of $100,000 to $250,000 for its rivals, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Tesla can use the additional funds from non-Tesla customers to expand its Supercharger network, further fueling the flywheel. \r  \n\r  \nWhile it's still early days for these charging collaborations, this could eventually be a big revenue generator for Tesla.\n\n# \rThe fine print\n\n\rAs previously noted, Tesla's stock price has soared this year -- up nearly 50% in the past month alone -- as a result of the recent announcements, with a commensurate increase in its valuation. The stock currently has a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 77 and sells for over eight times forward sales -- a lofty valuation by any measure. For context, analysts expect the company to grow revenue by 22% and 29%, respectively, in 2023 and 2024. Value investors will no doubt balk at the stock's hefty price tag.\r  \n\r  \nThat said, Tesla is the undisputed leader in the U.S. EV market and is just beginning to flex its charging station muscles. If the company eventually adopts a similar strategy for batteries and energy storage solutions, Tesla's recent gains could be just the beginning for those with a long-term outlook.\r  \n",

    "title": "How Shopify ($SHOP) 'shape shift' made e-commerce firm attractive again",
    "selftext": "E-commerce software and services provider Shopify ($SHOP) suddenly looks a lot different to investors in the wake of a strategy shift. Canada-based Shopify in early June completed the sale of its fulfillment unit, easing investor angst over rising investments for SHOP stock.\r  \n\r  \nWith the move, Canada-based Shopify slashed capital spending and improved its financial outlook.\r  \n\r  \n\"Post the recent 'shape shift' where it exited the logistics business and reduced over 20% of the workforce, the company is free cash flow positive,\" said UBS analyst Kunal Madhukar in a recent report.\n\n  \n**Covid Emergency E-Commerce Boost**\r  \nFurther, Shopify stock has jumped 90% in 2023 as of June 14. Shopify stock has gained 42% since the company announced the sale of the fulfillment business to privately held Flexport on May 4. SHOP stock rebounded from a 2022 sell-off spurred by worries over growing investments and management turnover.\r  \n\r  \nShares are trading near a 14-month high, trying to clear a short consolidation forged after surging on May 4 following the first-quarter earnings report and the Flexport deal.  \n\"While SFN (Shopify Fulfillment Network) turned out to be an expensive experiment, we also must recognize that Shopify made a fast pivot \u2014 taking calculated risks can sometimes lead to strategic mistakes,\" said Baird analyst Colin Sebastian in a report. \"We still believe Shopify can be a trillion-dollar GMV (gross merchandise volume) platform with take rates expanding as the company widens in scope.\"\r  \n\r  \nIn 2022, Shopify's GMV growth slowed to 12% ($197.2 billion). GMV growth has been trending down since 2020 when it boomed 96% during the coronavirus pandemic. Consumers shifted to online shopping during the emergency. In addition, Shopify in 2022 accounted for roughly 18% of all U.S. e-commerce, says UBS.\r  \n\r  \nAccording to research firm Gartner, Shopify is the largest e-commerce software provider with about 15% global share, ahead of SAP (SAP) and Salesforce (CRM). Shopify garners nearly two-thirds of revenue from the U.S.\r  \n\r  \nShopify sets up e-commerce websites for businesses. It partners with companies such as Stripe to handle digital payments. Well-funded and fast-growing Stripe has put off an initial public offering.\r  \n\r  \nAmong merchants services is Shop Pay. It's an accelerated checkout option for stores on the Shopify platform. Shopify Capital provides loans to merchants. The new Shop Cash rewards program provides consumers with incentives, aiming to boost GMV through higher orders.\r  \n\r  \n**SHOP Stock: PayPal Friction?**\r  \nMeanwhile, Shopify has encroached on PayPal Holdings (PYPL), said Lisa Ellis, analyst at SVB MoffettNathanson in a report.\r  \n\r  \n\"PayPal and Shopify have a long-standing partnership and PayPal enjoys a privileged position on the Shopify platform,\" said Ellis in a report. \"However, many of Shopify's payments-related initiatives pose a competitive threat to PayPal.\"\r  \n\r  \nShe noted Shopify Payments, a payment processing service offered through Stripe. Ellis also noted a \"buy now, pay later\" consumer financing service that Shopify now offers through Affirm Holdings (AFRM).\r  \n\r  \nMeanwhile, to build up a logistics business that stored and shipped products for its merchant customers, Shopify had acquired Deliverr for $2.1 billion in 2022. In 2019 it bought startup 6 River Systems for $450 million.\r  \n\r  \nFlexport will be Shopify's logistics partner under a revenue-sharing arrangement. Shopify now holds a 13% equity interest in Flexport.\r  \n\r  \n**Shopify To Join Amazon Buy With Prime?**  \nAmid the sale, there's also speculation over a possible Shopify deal with e-commerce giant Amazon.com (AMZN).\r  \n\r  \nAmazon now offers its massive distribution network to merchants that do not sell goods on its website. Amazon's product fulfillment services are part of a program called Buy With Prime.\r  \n\r  \nAt UBS, Madhukar says Shopify could join the Buy With Prime program based on management comments on Shopify's first-quarter earnings call.\r  \n\r  \n\"The company said things are moving positively in their discussions with Amazon on BwP, which could suggest they may be closer to getting a deal done,\" Madhukar said. \"Although it is still unclear whether a deal will make SHOP whole on gross profit dilution, a resolution could result in a better merchant and consumer experience, and lead to higher volumes that may offset any potential dilution.\"\r  \n\r  \nAlso, Shopify rival BigCommerce (BGIC) uses Amazon's fulfillment services.\r  \n\r  \nStarted in 2006, Shopify recently hiked contract prices for merchants.\r  \n\r  \nIn the quarter ended March 31, Shopify earned one cent per share on an adjusted basis, down a penny from a year earlier. Revenue for SHOP stock rose 25% to $1.5 billion, the company said.\r  \n\r  \nAnalysts expected the Shopify earnings report to show a loss of 4 cents on revenue of $1.435 billion. Gross merchandise volume rose 15% to $49.6 billion, topping estimates of $47.75 billion.\r  \n\r  \nIn 2023, Wall Street analysts expect adjusted profit to boom to 33 cents a share from 4 cents last year. Shopify earnings per share is projected to rise 70% to 56 cents in 2024.\r  \nRevenue will rise 20% to $6.74 billion this year and 18% in 2024 to $7.93 billion, analysts predict.\r  \n\r  \nShopify Stock: Enterprise Marketing Push\r  \nTo spur GMV growth for SHOP stock, Shopify has partnered with Facebook (FB), Pinterest (PINS) and Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google in social media marketing.\r  \n\r  \nMeanwhile, analysts expect Shopify to target larger companies.\r  \n\r  \nIn May, Shopify launched a program called Commerce Components. It enables businesses to integrate Shopify's checkout and back-office services with their existing online platforms. Further, toymaker Mattel (MAT) is one early customer.\r  \n\r  \n\"Subscription pricing increase that rolled out at the end of April will be a key catalyst supporting topline growth and margins,\" said Evercore ISI analyst Mark Mahaney in a report. \"And Shopify continues to drive product innovations, especially for enterprise solutions. Commerce Components offers a lightweight solution for large enterprises without replacing the merchants' whole online infrastructure.\"",

    "title": "How US stocks rose 20% from their lows, and where they might be going",
    "selftext": "U.S. stocks have defied fears of a recession, a banking crisis and soaring Treasury yields to rise 20% from their October lows - one definition of a bull market.\r  \n\r  \nThe benchmark S&P 500 index closed at a low of 3,577.03 on Oct. 12, 2022, down 25% from its all-time high after the Federal Reserve unleashed a series of bruising interest rate increases to fight decades-high inflation.\r  \n\r  \nOn Thursday, it closed up 0.6% at 4,293.93, amid growing optimism over the economic outlook and a rate hiking cycle that appears to be nearing its end. Here are some features of the index's rally, and a look at where stocks might go from here.\n\nWhile markets seldom rise in a straight line, the S&P 500's journey from the bottom took 164 days - the longest 20% climb from a bear market low in five decades. Among the factors holding stocks back was a surge in Treasury yields to their highest levels in decades that dulled the allure of equities by offering investors the potential to earn attractive income in government-backed bonds.\r  \n\r  \nA crisis that saw the biggest bank busts since the Great Recession also shook investor confidence, as did worries over a potentially catastrophic fight over lifting the U.S. debt ceiling.\n\nThe narrow breadth of the S&P 500's rally has been a concern for some investors, with just seven stocks - Alphabet (GOOGL.O), Apple (AAPL.O), Microsoft (MSFT.O), Amazon (AMZN.O), Meta (META.O), Nvidia (NVDA.O) and Tesla (TSLA.O) - responsible for almost all of the index's gains this year. Many investors view these stocks as safe bets in uncertain times. Their gains were also driven by excitement over advances in artificial intelligence.\n\nMore recently, however, the market's gains have shown tentative signs of broadening out to other stocks.\n\nMeanwhile, volatility has subsided - not only in stocks, but in Treasuries and currencies.\r  \n\r  \nOne reason for the calm in markets is investors' belief that the Fed is unlikely to deliver many more of the rate hikes that shook asset prices last year.\r  \n\r  \nInvestors have also been encouraged by evidence showing that the U.S. economy continues to be resilient in the face of the central bank's monetary tightening, while inflation slowly cools. The U.S. Citigroup Economic Surprise Index (.CESIUSD) shows U.S. economic data has in aggregate topped market expectations, helped by stronger than expected numbers for employment and consumer spending.\r  \n\r  \nA 20% gain from bear market lows has in the past heralded further upside for stocks.\n\nIn four of the last six bear markets, the S&P went on to rise 20% or more in the six months after hitting this milestone.\n\n[https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/how-us-stocks-rose-20-their-lows-where-they-might-be-going-2023-06-09/](https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/how-us-stocks-rose-20-their-lows-where-they-might-be-going-2023-06-09/)\n\n&#x200B;",

They get banged up, but I like the asset and you can average down if you look at it that way. Pretty much everything I deal with has some type of return on it; some kind of dividend. If you look back a year ago, we had very low interest rates, like zero. So when you're looking at a stock and not only do you really like the asset, but then they're giving you a dividend, it\u2019s such a bonus. You're setting yourself up for potential stock growth, but you're also receiving 3% to 4% annually.\n\n> I really try to stay by the book: I like to buy companies at around 15 times price-to-earnings. I have a couple strong positions in Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL) and Apple (AAPL). I've been buying Apple forever; every time it goes down, I buy more Apple. I also buy JPMorgan (JPM), which pays about 3% dividend. Another company I really like, and have been invested in for a long time, is Blackstone (BX). The multiple doesn\u2019t fit in there because it's high, but I just like their whole portfolio of assets.\n\n> I\u2019m really pretty good about keeping diversified. But I really look at stocks that give you a good dividend. I look at a company that's not generating any cash, has no dividend and has this crazy high PE multiple, and I just stay away. I think it's for other people. It's not for me.\n\nHe considers himself a fairly conservative and by the book investor, so I was interested in learning more about how you guys evaluate a stock and what you think of his approach.\n\nFor example, one stock that I've been looking at off and on for quite a while now, but don't own, is POSCO (PKX).  They're currently at a 9.32 PE, which is below the 15x that Arte Moreno looks for, but they have a 3.90% dividend and they're generating cash. Is that info enough to make an investment or do you look for more?\n\nThank you for any help you can provide. I'm genuinely interested in learning more about investing. I have a couple funds for retirement, but I was considering adding another account at Vanguard to invest in maybe 4-5 companies I like once I learn more.",

    "selftext": " \n\n# Meta Platforms ($META)\n\nShares of social media giant Meta Platforms have rallied by a phenomenal 107% year-to-date. The company impressed investors by returning back to revenue growth in the first quarter (after three straight quarters of decline) despite subdued digital ad spending due to macro pressures.\n\nInvestors have also cheered the company\u2019s aggressive cost-cutting and streamlining efforts, including thousands of layoffs. Despite the distraction caused by regulatory matters, most Wall Street analysts remain optimistic about Meta\u2019s prospects.\n\nMeta\u2019s user base continues to expand, with daily active people (number of users who visited at least one of the family apps \u2013Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp in a day) growing 5% year-over-year to 3.02 billion (on average) in March. The company expects capital expenditure of $30 billion to $33 billion this year toward the build-out of its artificial intelligence (AI) capacity to support ads, Feed, and Reels as well as increased investment in generative AI initiatives.\n\n**Is Meta a Good Stock to Buy?**\n\nOn Tuesday, Piper Sandler analyst Thomas Champion reiterated a Buy rating on Meta Platforms stock with a price target of $270 after taking a deep look at the company\u2019s AI capabilities.The analyst sees the company leveraging AI to boost user engagement, develop better and more automated advertiser tools, and create an open-source AI ecosystem. Champion is also optimistic about Meta\u2019s positioning within the digital ads space.\n\n## Amazon ($AMZN)\n\nLike Meta, Amazon is also reducing its costs to navigate a tough business backdrop. The company\u2019s retail business has been under pressure due to the impact of macro challenges on consumer spending. Additionally, the slowdown in the growth rate of the higher-margin Amazon Web Services (AWS) business has also been concerning. Enterprises are moderating their IT budgets, which is weighing on AWS\u2019s growth.\n\nWall Street continues to be bullish on Amazon and sees solid potential in the retail and AWS divisions over the long term. Moreover, AMZN\u2019s rapidly growing advertising business is also expected to boost revenue in the years ahead. Despite macro pressures, Amazon\u2019s ad revenue increased 23% year-over-year to $9.5 billion in Q1.\n\n**Is AMZN a Buy, Sell, or Hold?**\n\nEarlier this week, Mizuho analyst James Lee increased his price target for Amazon to $160 from $145 and reiterated a Buy rating, calling the stock his top pick for the second half of 2023. The analyst expects multiple expansion as concerns about the company\u2019s AI market position \u201cdiminish.\u201d\n\nRecent channel checks by Lee\u2019s firm with a leading channel partner indicated that AWS\u2019s generative AI demand has been accelerating due to the ease of transition and product differentiation.\n\n\u201cCase studies show that AWS wins over clients on intelligence privacy and data security,\u201d said Lee. Further, he also highlighted that generative AI is priced meaningfully higher than conventional computing, so it is expected to be both revenue and margin accretive to AWS. Consequently, Lee believes AWS revenue growth will likely trough in Q2 before rebounding in the second half of the year.\n\n## Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX)\n\nNetflix\u2019s crackdown on password sharing has improved investor sentiment about the streaming giant. Password sharing has been a key concern for Netflix, especially as competition has become intense in the streaming space. Netflix had previously estimated that over 100 million households share accounts, representing 43% of its global user base. This week, Netflix rolled out its password-sharing crackdown to its home market.\n\nAside from the password-sharing crackdown, Netflix\u2019s business is expected to improve through its recent introduction of a cheaper, ad-supported tier.\n\n**What is the Price Target for Netflix?**\n\nOn Thursday, Oppenheimer analyst Jason Helfstein increased the price target for Netflix stock to $450 from $415 and maintained a Buy rating in reaction to the launch of paid sharing offering at $7.99 per additional household stream.\n\nPrior to the announcement, the analyst\u2019s firm conducted a survey of 1,800 U.S. Netflix consumers. The survey indicated a healthy propensity to pay for \u201cremote\u201d users, with certain abandoned users willing to pay for their own subscriptions.\n\nWhile 45% of respondents indicated a willingness to pay for \u201cremote\u201d users, 70% indicated an inclination for the $6.99 ad-tier plan. With pricing of the paid sharing option above the ad-tier, the survey suggests a significant portion of these users will be pushed toward the ad-based offer.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nWall Street is more bullish on Meta Platforms and Amazon compared to Netflix. Given the massive rally in Meta stock, Wall Street sees higher upside potential in Amazon stock from current levels. Analysts mainly see solid potential in Amazon\u2019s AWS cloud business, supported by solid demand for cloud computing and prospects for growth in the AI space.",

    "title": "Netflix (NFLX) DCF Analysis.",
    "selftext": "# INTRODUCTION:\n\nNFLX has come a long way since being rejected by blockbuster, its secret formula being the first to embrace change. It embraced DVD at a time where VHS was still the dominant mode of display. It embraced Streaming when the world started catching onto DVD. NFLX's edge was that it always pivoted quickly to the next big thing. But NFLX\u2019s massive progress may soon grind to a halt. From lackluster solutions to strong competitors and pure market saturation, NFLX has a tough road ahead.   \n \n\n**INVESTMENT THESIS 1:**\n\n*Overblown Growth Solutions*\n\nWhen NFLX lost subscribers for the first time in 10 years, people freaked out and started selling off NFLX. But it seems that when NFLX announced its plans and after 1 successful quarter with some results from Ad-Tier NFLX bounced back up almost doubling from when it first dropped due to the shock.   \n \n\nAd-Tier has some parallels to pirated sites. Both stream contents with Ads injected into the mix, either before the video plays or on the side of the screen. The main difference is that one is free and the other costs $6.99/month.\n\nThere are only so many people in the world that wants a YouTube equivalent as their streaming platform. The people who purchase Ad-Tier are usually \u201cseasonal\u201d fans, those that purchase cheaply so that they can watch their favorite series and unsubscribe afterwards. These subscribers have no longevity to them and temporarily bump up NFLX\u2019s numbers.  \n \n\nPaid-sharing, getting people to get off shared accounts and getting their own accounts. Depending on how NFLX goes about it paid sharing could be a game changer for NFLX. There is already an existing customer base from those that are sharing account, they show a liking for NFLX but whether these customers will convert is dependent on certain factors Effectiveness of Paid-Sharing, \u2018FOMO\u2019 factor and Piracy.\n\nEffectiveness of Paid-Sharing,   \nIs the net cast wide enough to catch all the paid-sharing users? What are the ways we go about catching Paid-Sharing?\n\n\u2018FOMO\u2019 factor,   \nJust how much are customers missing out will determine how they weigh the cost of monthly subscription and the ability to participate in the latest series.\n\nPiracy,   \nIs it easy to find alternatives that can provide what NFLX provides for free?\n\n**INVESTMENT THESIS 2:**\n\n*Strong Competitors & Lack of C.A.*\n\nThe usual suspects obviously include DIS, Hulu and AMZN prime. But, what about the less obvious ones?\n\nTikTok & Instagram reels. There\u2019s only so much entertainment needed in one\u2019s life. You can\u2019t possibly simultaneously watch TikTok while watching a NFLX series, your attention can only be paid in one direction. ([SOURCE](https://www.marketingdive.com/news/tiktok-netflix-gen-z-video-broadcast-app/634594/#:~:text=TikTok%20has%20jumped%20over%20Netflix,the%20sixth%20most%20popular%20service))\n\nOr AMZN with an all-inclusive ride on their AMZN prime with AMZN prime offering other benefits on their online retail store. They are \u201cOffer-Stacking\u201d creating an unbeatable offer that NFLX can\u2019t counter. \n\nDIS has a large vault of already created storyline that they have archived yet to be released onto Disney+ and the familiarity of DIS\u2019 brand name enhanced by their theme park creates a very strong branding fit for the entire family that NFLX can\u2019t parallel. ([SOURCE](https://www.statista.com/statistics/294111/leading-organizations-in-licensed-merchandise-worldwide/))\n\nNFLX has no differentiator other than it was the earliest entrant and is now the largest entrant. There are certain exclusive content on NFLX that may make it appealing, but these kinds of advantages are superficial and over the long run, these exclusive content may offer their rights to stream to competitors or may be pirated.  \n   \n \n\n**INVESTMENT THESIS 3:**\n\n*Market Saturation*\n\nNFLX can only grow so much.\n\nUCAN from FY21-22 only added 0.7M subscribers and LATAM added 3M. LATAM\u2019s market was already said to be 75% penetrated by NFLX ([SOURCE](https://labsnews.com/en/articles/technology/netflix-streaming-leader-latin-america-future/)).\n\nNFLX should focus on making its subscribers more valuable which management has said it will focus on now, but it has only so far laid out plans to attract new subscribers. \n\nEven if Linear Network loses most of its grounds in the next 10 years, NFLX may not gain much subscribers from Linear Network simply because Linear Network is mainly supported by the exact demographic that would not be on NFLX.  \n\n\n# REVENUE:\n\n***Model***\n\nI\u2019ve used a bottoms-up approach when modelling my revenue and forecasted using historical data and surveys done.\n\n***Revenue/Subscriber***\n\nNFLX applies third degree price discrimination in how it prices subscriptions/month for different regions. Regions where it has already established a presence and where NFLX integrated into their daily life, NFLX charges a higher subscription/month.  \n \n\nBut I don\u2019t think every region will eventually tend towards the UCAN cost. Certain regions may see subscription services as a luxury good.  \n \n\nOverall, with the implementation and wide rollout of the Ad Tier I project my average revenue/customer to be higher for every region as the Ad Tier generates higher revenue per subscriber monthly, according to management.\n\nAccording to 2021 US Bureau of Labor Statistics, an American with Annual income of $78,743 and expenditure of $66,928 spent 0.97% of that amount in entertainment and of that 0.97% only 18% goes towards \u201cFees and admissions\u201d so about 0.17% of $66,928 went towards NFLX. $654 represented the annual spending on subscription services + others. NFLX takes up 30% of this, most households have more than 1 subscription. So, NFLX is probably tethering at the limit at which it can raise prices.  \n \n\nComparing the cost per month of subscription between NFLX and its closest competitor DIS, Disney+ cost $4.80 compared to NFLX $15.86.  \n    \nSo, I forecast that the majority of increase in Revenue/Subscriber for the US will come from wider adoption of Ad-Tier subscription which yields a higher amount of Revenue/Subscriber rather than NFLX increasing prices.\n\nEuropean subscription is one of the highest cost to subscribe ([SOURCE](https://beebom.com/how-much-netflix-costs-each-country-worldwide/)) so, I'd say its unlikely EMEA will raise monthly subscription cost but rather EMEA is the region with the highest likelihood to group subscribe to lower subscription cost. So EMEA is more likely to add subscribers than revenue/subscriber. \n\n**OVERALL, I assume that the full effects of FOMO for Ad-Tier will only show up from 2025 onwards.**  \n \n\n***No. of Subscriber***\n\nFor Paid Sharing,   \nNFLX has stated that the potential market could be up to 100+M households. I do also believe that convincing people who were previously sharing accounts of purchasing their own account may take some time to catch on, as they will have large FOMO after being locked out of their old account and missing the latest shows. And since NFLX only intends on fully releasing Paid Sharing from 23Q2 onwards, I believe the substantial addition to subscribers will only show up from 2025 onwards with the FOMO effect in full and Paid Sharing being rolled out entirely.  \n \n\nFor fall of Linear Network, \n\n([SOURCE](https://morningconsult.com/2023/03/28/linear-tv-viewership-gen-z-millennials/))\n\nAlmost 40% of Linear Network supporters are baby boomers. As the baby boomers age and decrease in numbers Linear Network will start losing its main customers, freeing up market share for NFLX to take as the younger generations start being associated with Streaming services, streaming will become the new norm.  \n \n\nBUT, this cultural change will be one that takes time. It will not show up to a substantial amount in the time period of my forecast. So I opt for more granularity.    \n   \n**REVENUE MODEL: \\[**[INSERT](https://imgur.com/a/9c2expe)\\]\n\n# MARGINS:\n\nThe difficulty in figuring out margins is that there is no reliable historic data within the past 5 years. Margins were always extremely skewed by extreme conditions.\n\nE.g. from 2019 to 2020 margins jumped from 12% to 18% due to covid accelerating the adoption of NFLX.  \nOR in 2021 the marginal cost of acquiring content wrt to revenue being generated was the cheapest of the past 7 years at $0.5836 per $1 of revenue generated. Likely because people were embracing NFLX as tech adoption was accelerated prior year, margins peaking only a year later.\n\nSo, cost is broken down into 3 categories (Acquisition, Marketing and (Tech & Dev + G&A)). Tech & Dev + G&A are lumped together for more granularity instead of inaccurate forecasts.  \n \n\n***Acquisition***\n\nAs NFLX transitions into subscriber retention mode rather than attracting subscribers it inevitably will spend more on making its services more attractive so that existing customers will face a higher \u201cemotional\u201d switching cost, so churn rate is lowered. But acquisition will continue to take the largest portion of cost.  \n\n\n***Marketing***\n\nEventually the NFLX brand becomes more well-known or integrated into people\u2019s daily life that they spend less on marketing themselves and more on advertising new content. Marketing costs will start to tend downwards. BUT there must always be a baseline amount of marketing cost to advertise new content.  \n \n\n***Tech & Dev + G&A***\n\nTech & Dev + G&A is likely to remain elevated for the first few years as NFLX starts to roll out Ad-Tier and begin supporting a substantial amount of new subscribers from Ad-Tier. But eventually as the number of new subscribers dwindles down, NFLX gets more efficient and needs fewer employees. It will also implement new tech features e.g. AI tech support to lower the number of employees necessary. So at that point Tech & Dev + G&A will tend downwards.  \n\n\n**COST MODEL: \\[**[INSERT](https://imgur.com/a/yX54W9I)**\\]**\n\n# COST OF CAPITAL:\n\n***Cost of Debt***\n\nRFR (3M Average) = 3.53%\n\nRisk Spread (3M Average) = 1.71% ([SOURCE](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/BAMLC0A4CBBB))\n\nCost of Debt = 5.24%\n\n  \n\n***Timing of Debt***\n\n\\[[TABLE](https://imgur.com/a/CoSEpe2)\\]\n\nWeighted Average Timing of Debt = 1.57 Years.\n\nMV Debt = 19225M\n\n***Cost of Equity***\n\nMarket Beta = 1.27 ([SOURCE](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NFLX?p=NFLX))\n\nMarket Price(3M Average) = $341.52\n\nShares O/S = 445M\n\nMV Equity = 151976M  \n   \n 4105.02 = \\[4.58% x 4105.02\\] x (1+5%) / (1+R) + (\\[4.58% x 4105.02\\] x (1+5%)) x (1+3.417%) / R - 3.417% / (1+R) \\^2  \n R = 8.635%  \n RFR (US) = 3.417%  \n ERP = 5.218%\n\nCOE = 10.16%\n\n***Weightage***\n\n% Equity = 88.8%\n\n%Debt = 11.2%\n\n***WACC***\n\nCorporate marginal Tax Rate = 21%\n\nWACC = 9.49%  \n\n\n# CONCLUSION:\n\nUltimately, I\u2019ve valued NFLX at $174.62, I just don\u2019t believe in how astronomical growth could be, with all the changes that NFLX has introduced into the company. I believe that NFLX has set their priorities wrongly and are focusing on the wrong things, Subscriber growth shouldn\u2019t be the focus it should be making our subscribers more profitable. It\u2019s a good sign that they started caring and innovating again. But at the current trajectory I just don\u2019t see it working out.  \n\n\nDCF: \\[[INSERT](https://imgur.com/a/pCyLgNV)\\]",

    "selftext": " First-quarter earnings season is in full swing right now, with none bigger than last week's **Amazon.com** ($**AMZN**) numbers, which topped analyst estimates. The company is now responsible for a huge portion of the S&P 500's earnings performance.\n\n E-commerce giant Amazon is the largest contributor to earnings growth for the entire S&P 500 for the first quarter and 2023, according to John Butters, senior earnings analyst at FactSet Research Systems.\n\nIf Amazon were excluded, Butters says, the blended earning decline (reported plus expected results) for the S&P 500 in Q1 would grow to -5.1% from -3.7%. And the estimated earnings growth rate for the entire S&P 500 this year would fall to 0.2% from 1.2%.\n\nFactSet says that from a macro perspective, \"At the midpoint of the Q1 2023 earnings season, S&P 500 companies are recording their best performance relative to analyst expectations since Q4 2021. Both the number of companies reporting positive EPS surprises and the magnitude of these earnings surprises are above their 10-year averages.\"\n\nAmazon.com also is the largest contributor to earnings growth for the Consumer Discretionary sector. Excluding the company, the estimated 2023 earnings growth for the sector falls to 10.1% from 27.2%. \n\n \n\n## Amazon Earnings\n\nOn April 27, Amazon **reported strong first-quarter earnings and sales results** that topped Wall Street targets. Amazon earned 31 cents per share, up from the year-ago period's 38-cent loss. Meanwhile, revenue climbed 9% to $127.35 billion.\n\nHowever, management said Amazon Web Services is seeing slower growth in April vs. Q1. First-quarter sales for the cloud computing unit, Amazon Web Services, rose 16% to $21.4 billion, slowing from 37% growth in the year-earlier period. Analysts had projected AWS growth of 15% for the March quarter.\n\nThat spooked investors \u2014 $AMZN stock dropped 4% in response \u2014 because Wall Street analysts have expected **AWS revenue growth to trough** in the June quarter of 2023, then slowly reaccelerate. However, if the U.S. economy falls into a recession, the AWS slowdown could hit bottom later.\n\nLooking forward, Amazon's 2023 earnings are expected to swing to a $1.56 per-share profit from 2022's 27-cent loss. Annual earnings are expected to jump 65% in 2024.\n\n \n\n## $AMZN Stock Builds New Base\n\nAmazon stock continues to consolidate in a **cup-with-handle base** that has a 110.96 **buy point**. $AMZN stock is about 7% away from that entry, as it rallied 1% Wednesday. A key flaw is that the stock spent the entirety of the base below the **long-term 200-day moving average**.\n\nKeep in mind that Amazon is a longtime laggard, with a weak **relative strength line**. Plus, shares remain about 30% off their 52-week high, so there is plenty of **overheard supply** that could hinder the stock's rebound.\n\n[https://www.investors.com/research/amazon-this-is-what-sp-500-earnings-would-look-like-without-amzn/](https://www.investors.com/research/amazon-this-is-what-sp-500-earnings-would-look-like-without-amzn/)",

S&P 500 and Nasdaq-100 futures slipped 0.3% each.\n*****\n> Amazon shares were down about 1% after initially rising following the online retailer\u2019s first-quarter results. Meanwhile, Snap tumbled 18% in extended trading following a revenue miss. Pinterest shares fell 14% after issuing disappointing second-quarter revenue growth expectations.\n*****\n> The earnings season has been better than expected. Of the 261 S&P 500 companies that have reported earnings, about 80% have reported positive surprises, according to FactSet data.\n*****\n> Still, some traders expressed skepticism that this earnings season is strong.\n*****\n> \u201cIt doesn\u2019t take us out of an earnings recession. We\u2019re still in an earnings recession. And this calendar quarter, which we are in right now, we are going to see the most intense economic contraction and potentially the deepest earnings contraction of what will be a sequential three quarter decline,\u201d Virtus Investment Partners\u2019 Joseph Terranova said Thursday on CNBC\u2019s \u201cClosing Bell.\u201d\n*****\n> On the more positive side, Intel shares climbed more than 4% after the semiconductor firm beat estimates on the top and bottom lines.\n*****\n> Investors are coming off a strong trading session for the major averages, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 notching their best day since January. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite jumped 2%, posting its best day since March.\n*****\n> Those gains come after a better-than-expected report from Meta fueled a rally in tech stocks. Investors appeared to shake off light GDP data that could signal the Federal Reserve\u2019s rate-hiking campaign may soon come to an end.\n*****\n> On the economic front, traders will watch for the latest personal income and spending data, due out Friday before the open. Economists polled by Dow Jones are expecting core prices to have risen 0.3% in March from the prior month. That\u2019s in line with the prior reading.\n*****\n> The final reading of the April consumer sentiment data is also set to be released Friday at 10 a.m. ET. It\u2019s expected to show a reading of 63.5, which is the same as the previous readout.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n# YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/yO6MZOZ.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n# TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S S&P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/DvjRzgy.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/wp3661X.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#NEXT WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/SRaPOCA.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#NEXT WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/4enQJ8f.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#NEXT WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!]()**)\n(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/rmVhCFg.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/QjYVMsW.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS AFTERNOON'S AFTER-HOURS EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!]()**)\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES!]()**)\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES!](https://i.imgur.com/jCUShfv.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/Wdb10aZ.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/H1G5tV1.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/4aS5do7.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/mmu3TCT.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/28/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-premarket-snap-intc-fslr-xom.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n> **Capital One** \u2014 Shares were down 3.3% after disappointing quarterly earnings.

    "selftext": "Good Friday evening to all of you here on r/stocks! I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this week, and are ready for the new trading week ahead. :)\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning April 24th, 2023.\n\n# **Stocks end Friday\u2019s session little changed, Dow snaps 4-week win streak: Live updates - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/20/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)**\n*****\n> The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended little changed Friday and finished lower for the week as investors evaluated the latest earnings results and concerns of disappointing profits.\n*****\n> The 30-stock index added 22.34 points, or 0.07%, to end at 33,808.96, while the S&P 500 eked out a 0.09% gain to settle at 4,133.52. The Nasdaq Composite rose 0.11% to close at 12,072.46.\n*****\n> All major indices finished the week in the red, with the Dow falling 0.23% to snap a four-week win streak. The tech-heavy Nasdaq saw the biggest decline, falling 0.42%, while the S&P slipped 0.1%.\n*****\n> \u201cThere\u2019s the continued push-pull of the fact that the economy has been a lot more resilient than many people expected and corporate earnings have held up pretty well, all things considered,\u201d said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer at Independent Advisor Alliance.\n*****\n> Even so, he noted that the Federal Reserve has raised rates substantially over the last year. Zaccarelli said that even if the central bank hikes as anticipated in May, it will likely hold rates at a higher level than the market expects.\n*****\n> \u201cYou can kind of see the the bull and bear case really right there in a nutshell as far as resilient economy with stronger-than-expected corporate earnings versus a very hot, very restrictive monetary policy coming from the Fed,\u201d he said.\n*****\n> Earnings season continued Friday, with results from Procter & Gamble. The consumer products company gained 3.5% after beating expectations and lifting it sales forecast. As of Friday morning, 76% of S&P 500 companies reporting earnings so far have beaten analyst EPS estimates, according to FactSet.\n*****\n> Elsewhere, materials stocks were the worst performers, with Freeport-McMoRan falling 4.1%. Albemarle tumbled 10% as Chile said it would nationalize its lithium industry.\n*****\n> While companies broadly beat expectations this week, overall profit reports failed to boost stocks, with some investors fearing an earnings drop looms with a likely recession ahead.\n*****\n> \u201cSo far, earnings season is off to an uneventful start, with many companies meeting already reduced earnings expectations and that helps to explain the lack of movement in the major stock indices over the past few days,\u201d said Carol Schleif, chief investment officer at BMO Family Office, adding that she expects stocks to trade in a tight range for some time.\n*****\n> Earnings continue next week with results on deck from Big Tech companies Amazon, Alphabet, Meta Platforms and Microsoft.\n\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/X80CMcG.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE S&P SECTORS FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/2sXCFPp.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/6UXdyyt.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/HeS3rk3.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/g7rVv6a.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/LtSkkqz.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/yQ3Msa8.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/nhTH81a.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/trf5gkX.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/HOShbKh.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/fJRFTJ8.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/PfOt4BN.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/d6UNrjj.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/ZfzSKpV.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/Ii3RcFW.png))**\n\n\n*****\n\n> # Lithium: The Cycle Continues\n\n> If you haven't checked the price of lithium lately, you might be in for a surprise. Spot prices for lithium carbonate in China have collapsed by two-thirds since hitting record highs in November of last year. Prices have gone from $84k per ton to $25k per ton. That unwinds the vast majority of a spectacular surge that played out from 2020 to 2022. Lithium initially surged 1,279% from July 2020 to March 2022 as part of the broader explosion of commodity prices and booming demand for electric vehicles, eventually peaking up 1,387% from the post-COVID lows. It's easy to forget that this critical battery input had already gone through one such cycle. A 224% rally in 6 months during late 2015 and early 2016 before a long, slow bear market that saw prices down 78% over several years.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/04/042123-Lithium-1.png))**\n\n> In the equity market, the price cycle hasn't been as dramatic in percentage terms, but there has still nonetheless been a double cycle of surging stock prices in 2016 followed by a grinding bear market, and then an even more dramatic surge through late 2022 that is now sliding into reverse. On Thursday, Chile's government announced reforms to its lithium extraction policy. While existing contracts with firms that operate in the rich lithium brine deposits of the Chilean Atacama desert will be honored, the market is looking at weaker lithium prices and the fact that existing contracts will be replaced by less favorable ones 10+ years down the line and hitting lithium players. SQM is off 21% today while ALB is 10% lower.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/04/042123-Lithium-2.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # April 2nd Half Strength After Tax Deadline\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/afa92ac85fc99643437fa5847f722d56/0e5336993d97da50-d7/s500x750/141da6a316fe62016dc5b44732a14607f4c27019.jpg))**\n\n> 1st half of April used to outperform the second half, but since 1994 that has not been the case. Traders are more focused on Q1 earnings and guidance during April than the Tax Deadline nowadays.\n\n> Expectations are low for earnings season and next week is a big week with 35% of S&P 500 stocks reporting next week including AMZN, GOOGL, META & MSFT, compared to less than 12% this week and 2% last week (Hat tip @ScottSchnipper @CNBC @CNBCPro). Better than expected results and upbeat guidance could rally stocks into month-end.\n\n> These 2 charts show how April is tracking usual performance over the last 21 years as well as during pre-election years. April is clearly weaker than normal, yet the market is still tracking the directional trends.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/9891a2da9b4d408133b986892263f446/0e5336993d97da50-20/s500x750/bb0e2c55fd3110169aa2d9addbe34683f918d2b7.jpg))**\n\n\n\n*****\n\n> # Jobless Claims Nearing New Highs\n\n> Jobless claims have continued to weaken with this week's release, rising by 5K to 245K versus expectations of no change from last week's upwardly revised 240K print. At current levels, claims sit at the high end of the range since the start of 2022 and only a couple thousand below last month's high.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/04/042023-Claims-1.png))**\n\n> Prior to seasonal adjustment, claims have essentially come in right inline with the reading for the same week last year and the few years prior to the pandemic. As shown in the second chart below, claims tend to experience a little bit of a bounce around this point of the year before resuming a move lower through the late spring.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/04/042023-Claims-2.png))**\n\n> Continuing claims were equally disappointing this week rising to 1.865 million, 40K above expectations. Although the increase to initial claims has not resulted in a new high, the 61K increase for continuing claims leaves the indicator at the highest level since late November 2021.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/04/042023-Claims-3.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Homebuilders Breaking Out Like It's...\n\n> It's hard to get over how well the homebuilder stocks have been performing lately. As shown in the charts below of stocks in the S&P 1500 Homebuilder group, these names are nearly universally in steep six-month uptrends and breaking out as we type.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/04/builders1.png))**\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/04/builders2.png))**\n\n> Below is another way to see just how crazy the run has been for the S&P 1500 Homebuilder stocks lately. Most names are now up 30-40% year-to-date after rallying 5-10% over the last week. This has pushed them ~10% above their 50-DMAs, and many are trading more than two (or even three for some) standard deviations above their 50-DMAs in extreme overbought territory.\n\n> \"Mr. Market\" has either lost its mind or it's predicting that all the current worries about housing in the months and quarters ahead are misguided.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/04/buildersuse.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Sell in May and go away \u2013 Maybe, it depends\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.stocktradersalmanac.com/UploadedImage/AIN_0523_20230413_4-yr_cycle_worst_months_table.jpg))**\n\n> In the above table the \u201cWorst Months\u201d performance of DJIA, S&P 500, and NASDAQ have been separated by year of the four-year-presidential-election cycle going back to 1951 for DJIA and S&P 500 and 1971 for NASDAQ. NASDAQ\u2019s \u201cWorst Months\u201d are July through October compared to May to October for DJIA and S&P 500. Even though pre-election years have historically been the best performing year of the four-year cycle, performance during the \u201cWorst Months\u201d has not been the least bit impressive. In 18 pre-election year \u201cWorst Months\u201d periods, DJIA has averaged a meager 1.14%. S&P 500 is only slightly better +1.81% while NASDAQ\u2019s average is under 1%. Frequency of gains or percentage of time higher in pre-election years \u201cWorst Months\u201d is only slightly better than 50-50.\n\n> Because of the elevated level of risk that has been historically observed during the \u201cWorst Six Months\u201d of the year and its historically tepid returns, reducing long exposure and developing a defensive strategy is the approach taken in the Almanac Investor Stock and ETF Portfolios. We do not merely \u201csell in May and go away.\u201d Instead, we take some profits, trim or outright sell underperforming stock and ETF positions, tighten stop losses and limit adding new long exposure to positions from sectors that have a demonstrated a record of outperforming during the \u201cWorst Months\u201d period.\n\n> For those with a lower risk tolerance or a desire to take a break from trading, the \u201cWorst Months\u201d are a great opportunity to unwind some longs and move into the relative safety of cash, Treasury bonds, gold and/or some combination of traditional defensive assets. For the first time in over a decade, cash can currently earn something other than zero. Preservation of capital may be more important than growth and with historical averages and frequency of gains reduced; the \u201cWorst Six Months\u201d are a good time to simply step aside if you prefer. August, September and/or October have provided some excellent buying opportunities over the years and could do the same again this year.\n\n*****\n\n> # Sector Breadth All Over the Place\n\n> In terms of price, the Industrials sector remains 5.75% below its high from January of last year and has yet to even take out the highs from earlier this year, but breadth has been more constructive recently. Just yesterday, the cumulative advance/decline line hit a new all time high.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/04/041823-Sectors-1.png))**\n\n> Although that measure of breadth is making promising moves, other breadth measures have not exactly echoed that strength. In spite of the record high in the cumulative A/D line Monday, only 37% of the sector's stocks finished above their 50-DMAs. As shown below, of all other instances of a record high in the cumulative AD line, there has never been such a low reading in the percentage of stocks above their 50-DMAs. In fact, no other readings have even crossed into the 30% range! For the vast majority of previous highs, the percentage of stocks above their 50-DMAs has sat at 70% or more.\n\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/04/041823-Sectors-2a.png))**\n\n> All that is to say that most Industrials sector stocks are moving higher, but have not yet moved above potential resistance at their 50-DMAs. And even though the reading on the percentage of stocks above their 50-DMAs is low at the moment, that is not to say it is not improving rapidly. As shown below, it has risen sharply from the low of 19.18% on April 6th. Furthermore, whereas Monday's close only saw 37% of the sector finish above their 50-DMAs, as of mid-morning Tuesday the reading is already up another 8.2 percentage points to 45.2% as the average stock in the sector trades just 7 bps below its 50-DMA.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/04/041823-Sectors-3.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Volatility Is The Toll We Pay\n\n> \u201cIt\u2019s a proprietary strategy. I can\u2019t go into it in great detail.\u201d \u2013 Bernie Madoff\n\n> Although Bernie Madoff was quite vague when asked how he had a strategy that printed money month after month when no one else could match it, as investors we know one thing and that is markets don\u2019t always go straight up.\n\n> Burt White, our Managing Director and Chief Strategy Officer, likes to say that volatility is the toll we pay to invest. No one wants to pay a toll, but sometimes you just have to do it to get where you are going. When I lived in Charlotte and would drive back up to Ohio for holidays, I\u2019d have to pay the great state of West Virginia $4.25 three different times on I-77. I didn\u2019t like it, but Santa brought the kids presents up there and I had to do it.\n\n> Getting back to the stock market, volatility is that toll that we pay for enjoying longer-term returns. Below is a great chart that sums it up and thanks to our friends at Ned Davis Research for helping us with the data.\n\n> Here\u2019s what you need to know regarding the S&P 500:\n\n> Each year sees more than seven different 3% percent dips.\nMore than three times a year do stocks correct 5%.\nAbout once a year on average sees a 10% correction.\nA 15% major correction happens every year-and-a-half.\nA 20% bear markets happens about every three years.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/blog-1-1-800x301.png))**\n\n> Another quote I like is from Regis Philbin when he said, \u201cI\u2019m involved in the stock market, which is fun, but sometimes very painful.\u201d Well, this year has been fun for investors, but last year was quite painful.\n\n> After more than a 120% rally off the March 2020 lows, maybe the bear market we saw last year shouldn\u2019t have caught as many investors off guard like it did? We didn\u2019t quite see a 25% bear market happening last year, but we expected as much as a 15% correction at some point. With the historically aggressive Fed, inflation soaring, China lockdowns, the war, and supply chains in disarray, it was a perfect cocktail for a bear market.\n\n> The truth though is we get spoiled by the good times and when the rough times hit, we are almost surprised that bad times ever happen. Well, they do happen and it is all part of investing, or the toll we pay to invest. Just know this, volatility and bear markets have happened before and will happen again. The good new though is after this bad times, likely better times will be coming!\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending April 21st, 2023** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED.)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 4/23/23** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED.)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> (*$AMZN $MSFT $META $FRC $KO $BA $VZ $GOOGL $UPS $ENPH $CLF $HAL $MCD $GM $GE $MMM $PEP $XOM $SPOT $INTC $AAL $V $ROKU $RTX $NEE $PHG $CAT $CVX $SNAP $LLY $VLO $LUV $BOH $MA $CROX $SIFY $JBLU $CMG $DOW $MO $ABBV $NOW $DHR $DX $NET $HUM $HLT $MRK $BMRC $PACW*)\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/HOShbKh.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/ZDMLgN9.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/vUijTz5.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # (T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n**(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)** (T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.).\n\n> #([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://charts.finviz.com/chart.ashx?t=SPY&ty=c&ta=st_c,sch_200p,sma_50,sma_200,sma_20,sma_100,bb_20_2,rsi_b_14,macd_b_12_26_9,stofu_b_14_3_3&p=d&s=l))\n\n*****\n\n# DISCUSS!\n\nWhat are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?\n\n*****\n\nI hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great trading week ahead r/stocks. :)",

    "selftext": "Arguably the two earliest starters in e-commerce to survive the tech bubble bursting, both Amazon (AMZN) and eBay (EBAY) positioned themselves well enough to thrive in Web 2.0. However, while Amazon today has become a behemoth ($1 trillion market cap and controlling an undisputed majority of online retail), eBay just kind of stagnated ($23.6 billion market cap, only about 10-15% of online retail despite being in second place to Amazon).\n\nTo be fair to eBay, nobody was going to match Amazon\u2019s ambitions of expansion and world domination. That said, what was once a competitive rival for Amazon is now more of an afterthought than a challenger. I\u2019m genuinely curious about how these two early starters grew so far apart.",

    "title": "Shopify ($SHOP) stock upgraded, claws above 50-day moving average",
    "selftext": " **Shopify** ($**SHOP**) is the **IBD Stock of the Day** as the e-commerce firm popped above its **50-day moving average** Wednesday following an analyst upgrade. Shopify remains a controversial stock amid stiff competition.  \n\nStarted in 2006, Canada-based Shopify sets up e-commerce websites for small businesses and partners with others to handle digital payments and shipping.\n\n It competes with **Amazon.com** ($**AMZN**), **PayPal Holdings** ($**PYPL**), **Wix** ($**WIX**), **BigCommerce** ($**BIGC**), and several others.\n\nOn the\u00a0**stock market today**, Shopify was up more than 4% at one point but gave back some of those gains as the market fell. Shares ended the trading day 1.2% higher to 45.30. Shares have climbed 30.5% in 2023 versus the Nasdaq's 14% gain in the wake of last year's downturn.\n\nIn a period of consolidation, Shopify stock has a traditional **entry point** of 54.76.\n\n## Earnings Due For Shopify Stock\n\nMore aggressive investors could consider taking a position at 48.36 amid a handle still in formation. The handle would be in the lower half of the base, which is a flaw.\n\nEarnings for Shopify stock are due in early May. \u00a0Investors may want to be cautious ahead of the earnings report. One strategy around earnings would use **call options**.\n\nAt JMP Securities, analyst Andrew Boone on Wednesday upgraded Shopify to market outperform from market perform with a price target of 65.\n\nFurther, Shopify is building a U.S. distribution network to store and ship products for its merchant customers. Rising investments for the distribution network have been one overhang on the stock.\n\n## Amazon Ramps 'Buy With Prime' For Merchants\n\nIn addition, Amazon has launched a new initiative. Amazon is offering its massive distribution network to outside merchants. Merchants who do not sell goods on\u00a0its website can use Amazon's product fulfillment services for delivery and returns as part of a program called Buy With Prime.\n\n## SHOP Stock Gained During Pandemic\n\nAt MoffettNathanson, analyst Lisa Ellis also views Shopify as a market share taker.\n\n\"Selling shovels to miners in an e-commerce gold rush is the perfect business,\" Ellis said in a note. \"Shopify seized the opportunity of the (coronavirus) pandemic and now powers 10% of all U.S. e-commerce. The gold rush has slowed. Shopify's multiple has contracted as investors digest a secular growth story transitioning to one of increased capital intensity and questions on profitability.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Shopify stock holds an IBD **Composite Rating**\u00a0of 85 out of the best possible 99, according to\u00a0**IBD Stock Checkup**.\n\nIBD's Composite Rating combines five separate proprietary ratings into one easy-to-use rating. Also, the best growth stocks have a Composite Rating of 90 or better.\n\nFurther, Shopify stock has an Accumulation/Distribution Rating of B. That rating analyzes price and volume changes in a stock over the past 13 weeks of trading. Its current rating indicates more funds are buying than selling.\n\n## Shopify Stock: 2023 Revenue Outlook Missed\n\nThe rating, on an A+ to E scale, measures the institutional buying and selling of stock. A+ signifies heavy institutional buying; E means heavy selling. Think of the C grade as neutral.\n\nFor the period ended Dec. 31, Shopify said it earned 7 cents per share on an adjusted basis, down 50% from a year earlier. Also, revenue for Shopify stock rose 26% to $1.7 billion, the company said.\n\nAnalysts expected the Shopify earnings report to record a loss of 1 cent on revenue of $1.65 billion. A year earlier, Shopify earned 14 cents per share on revenue of $1.38 billion.\n\nFor the first quarter of 2023, the company predicted revenue growth in the \"high teens.\" Analysts had projected more than 20% revenue growth. And in January, Shopify hiked contract prices for merchants.",

The transformation usually takes the shape of improved supply chain discipline as well as streamlining business operations in order to achieve better operating margins.\n\nFor the oil and\u00a0[natural gas](https://oilprice.com/admin/articles/Energy/Natural-Gas/Natural-Gas-A-Comprehensive-Guide-To-The-Worlds-Most-Crucial-Fuel.html)\u00a0industry, the moment of truth arrived a few years ago after years of weak benchmark prices, shrinking margins and massive capital flight forced the sector to seriously rethink the way it does business with energy companies increasingly turning toward tech heavyweights for help in cutting costs and streamlining operations.\u00a0\n\nA good case in point is\u00a0[a partnership](https://www.hartenergy.com/news/halliburton-teams-advance-digital-capabilities-microsoft-accenture-188653)\u00a0struck between\u00a0**Haliburton Co.**\u00a0(NYSE:HAL),\u00a0**Microsoft Inc.**\u00a0(NASDAQ:MSFT) and\u00a0**Accenture Plc.**\u00a0(NYSE:ACN) in 2020. For years, Haliburton, one of the world\u2019s largest oilfield services companies, has been plagued by shrinking margins and chronic underperformance. The company eventually made a deal with the two cloud giants to migrate its existing data centers to cloud and enhance digital offerings.\n\n Halliburton is hardly alone.\n\nAfter years of dilly-dallying, oil and gas companies are now rapidly moving their IT infrastructure out to the Cloud as well as adopting Business Process Management (BPM) systems. This frequently results in a leaner, more agile organizational model whilst delivering significant cost savings.\n\nBarclays estimates that the upstream market digital services industry will grow from less than $5 billion in 2020 to a more than $30 billion annual tab by 2025, thus enabling $150 billion in annual savings for oil producers. Opportunities for cost savings include cutting capital expenditures (capex) as well as selling, general and administrative (SG&A) costs and transportation operating costs.\n\nAccording to Barclays, the digital age is finally dawning for the energy sector with the market poised to erupt over the next five years. Over the past few years, Microsoft has struck cloud partnerships with several Big Oil companies including\u00a0**ExxonMobil**\u00a0(NYSE:XOM),\u00a0**Chevron Inc**. (NYSE:CVX) and Haliburton while Google\u2019s parent company\u00a0**Alphabet Inc.**\u00a0(NASDAQ:GOOG)[\u00a0has significantly expanded](https://www.slb.com/newsroom/press-release/2019/pr-2019-0513-slb-google-cloud)\u00a0its partnership with\u00a0**Schlumberger Ltd.**\u00a0(NYSE:SLB), another oilfield services giant. Meanwhile,\u00a0**Amazon Inc.**\u00a0(NASDAQ:AMZN) offers digital services to the industry through Amazon Web Services[\u00a0oil and gas division](https://aws.amazon.com/), and counts\u00a0**BP Plc**. (NYSE:BP) and\u00a0**Shell Plc**\u00a0(NYSE:SHEL) among its top clients.\n\n \n\nIn many cases, Big Oil\u2019s digital makeover is quite extensive.\n\nFor instance, Halliburton kicked off multiple digital transformation projects during the pandemic. Thailand\u2019s PTT Exploration and Production and Kuwait Oil Company were among the notable oil and gas companies that were awarded Halliburton contracts to implement digital transformation and enhance efficiency and production at their oilfields.\u00a0\n\nFor years, Big Oil has been using tech companies\u2019 enterprise software in their highly complex operating systems--including\u00a0 rig management operations and precise drilling techniques. However, they have traditionally been somewhat reluctant to hand over their treasure troves of valuable data mainly on cyber security concerns as well as the need to maintain competitive advantages, preferring instead to develop most of their software developed in-house or by companies within the oilfield services sector such as Haliburton.\u00a0\n\nHowever, this is now changing as they look for ways to improve operational efficiencies in a bid to squeeze higher cash flows and profits from their existing operations.\u00a0\n\nIs the new approach working? The evidence seems to suggest so, with shale drilling costs on an encouraging downtrend.\u00a0**J.P. Morgan**\u00a0estimates that Permian's Delaware Basin oil drillers now require oil prices of just \\~$33/bbl to break even down from $40/bbl in 2019.\u00a0",

    "selftext": "From [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/apple-to-spend-billions-more-on-entertainment-7370447)\n\n\"Apple Inc. (AAPL), the world's most valuable company, is mulling a billion-plus dollar foray into movie theaters and sports streaming in an attempt to drive subscriber growth for its Apple TV+ streaming platform.\n\nKEY TAKEAWAYS Apple could spend more than $1 billion a year to ramp up its movie releases and sports streaming.\n\nThe company is reportedly in talks with film studios to partner on theatrical releases of movies by Martin Scorsese and Ridley Scott.\n\nPreviously, Apple has devoted most of its $6.5 billion film and TV budget to television programs.\n\nThe move could help to drive viewers to Apple's streaming platform, Apple TV+, which lags far behind competitors like Amazon and Netflix.\n\nApple is expected to spend $1 billion a year to produce movies for theatrical release.\n\nThe company is reportedly in talks with movie studios to partner on the releases of upcoming movies by Martin Scorsese, Ridley Scott, and others.\n\nThe company is also reportedly considering bidding on the streaming rights to English football games.\n\nThe new plans constitute a significant increase in Apple's entertainment spending that could be part of an effort to draw more interest in Apple TV+, which lags behind rivals in subscriptions. Apple TV+ has an estimated 40 million subscribers, compared with at least 200 million each for Amazon's (AMZN) Prime Video and Netflix (NFLX).\n\nApple also lags behind rivals in content spending. The company spent about $6.5 billion on movies and television in 2021, while Amazon and Netflix spent $9 billion and $17 billion respectively.\n\nSo far, Apple's greatest streaming success has been in television, with the acclaimed series Ted Lasso. The business of releasing movies for wide theatrical distribution may be more complex, particularly given theater chains' struggles to rebound from COVID-19 and fend off competition from streaming services. Movie ticket sales are about a third below 2019 levels. Chains like AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. (AMC) have attributed the sluggish sales to a shortage of available films.\n\nApple's distribution agreements may help boost ticket sales, and it is not the only tech company entering theaters. Amazon acquired major studio Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer for $8.5 billion last year and now plans to make up to 15 movies for theatrical release each year.\n\nIn each case, Apple and Amazon may attempt to drive streaming viewership by later releasing those films on their respective platforms.\n\nApple's interest in adding English football games to its streaming platform follows last year's $2.5 billion 10-year streaming deal with U.S. Major League Soccer. Terms of a potential deal between Apple and the UK's Premier League have not been disclosed.\"\n\nPersonally, this sounds like the kind of move that more streamers (looking at you, Netflix) need to make. They aren't going to be throwing ridiculous money at it, but the content they are looking to produce is starting to look more like HBO level quality. If they have acclaimed directors like Scorsese and Ridley Scott on board, they could get their films in with a big theatrical release, make a shit tonne of money, THEN bring it onto streaming (much like Paramount did with Top Gun Maverick) for a bigger subscriber gain. Sounds like a win win win to me and we all know Apple has $billions in pocket change to throw at this.",

    "selftext": "Good Friday evening to all of you here on r/stocks! I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this week, and are ready for the new trading week ahead. :)\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning March 27th, 2023.\n\n# **Stocks close higher Friday as investors try to shake off latest bank fears: Live updates - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/23/stock-futures-are-up-slightly-as-investors-weigh-bank-troubles-fed-decision.html)**\n*****\n> Stocks rose Friday, reversing their earlier session declines as Deutsche Bank shares pared back some losses.\n*****\n> The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 132.28 points, or 0.41%, closing at 32,238.15. The S&P 500 rose 0.57%, while Nasdaq Composite ticked up 0.3%. The major indexes all had a winning week, with the Dow gaining 0.4% week-to-date as of Friday afternoon, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq gained 1.4% and 1.6%, respectively.\n*****\n> Deutsche Bank\u2019s U.S.-listed shares slid 3.11% Friday, rebounding from a 7% drop earlier in the trading session. A selloff of shares was triggered after the the German lender\u2019s credit default swaps jumped, but without an apparent catalyst. The move appeared to raise concerns once again over the health of the European banking industry. Earlier this month, Swiss regulators forced a UBS acquisition of rival Credit Suisse. Deutsche Bank shares traded off their worst levels of the session, which caused major U.S. indexes to also cut their losses.\n*****\n> \u201cI think that the market overall is neither frightened nor optimistic \u2014 it\u2019s simply confused,\u201d said George Ball, president at Sanders Morris Harris. \u201cThe price action for the last month-and-a-half, including today, is a jumble without any direction or conviction.\u201d\n*****\n> Ball added that Deutsche Bank is \u201cvery sound financially.\u201d\n*****\n> \u201cIt could be crippled if there\u2019s a big loss of confidence and there\u2019s a run on the bank. There is, however, no fundamental reason why that should occur, other than nervousness.\u201d\n*****\n> European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde tried to ease concerns, saying euro zone banks are resilient with strong capital and liquidity positions. Lagarde said the ECB could provide liquidity if needed.\n*****\n> Investors continued to assess the Fed\u2019s latest policy move announced this week. The central bank hiked rates by a quarter-point. However, it also hinted that its rate-hiking campaign may be ending soon. Meanwhile, Fed Chair Jerome Powell noted that credit conditions have tightened, which could put pressure on the economy.\n*****\n> On Thursday, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said regulators are prepared to take more action if needed to stabilize U.S. banks. Her comments are the latest among regulators attempting to buoy confidence in the U.S. banking system in the wake of the Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank closures.\n*****\n> \u201cRetail [and] institutional investors are both looking at the banking system, but now internationally. That\u2019s dangerous,\u201d Ball added. \u201cBanks exist because of confidence in their stability, and that confidence can be eroded as we now see, via social media and technology in a matter of minutes.\u201d\n\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/kYFZ0mb.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE S&P SECTORS FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/sa1yxWq.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/QsHW7no.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/OGQZBeP.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/uIef67v.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/kr3YfHV.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/JiYUEBP.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/CKcDnul.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/vsFHgKf.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/mconM20.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/H7KFVcz.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/ymKQozZ.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/TsJcX1J.png))**\n\n\n*****\n\n> # Best and Worst Stocks Since the COVID Crash Low\n\n> We are now three years out from the COVID Crash low, and even with the past year's weakness, most assets continue to sit on solid gains. For major US index ETFs, the S&P Midcap 400 (IJH) is up the most having slightly more than doubled while the S&P Smallcap 600 (IJR) is not far behind having rallied 95.9%. Value has generally outperformed growth, especially for mid and small-caps although that has shifted somewhat this year. For example, while its gains have been more middling since the COVID crash, the Nasdaq 100 (QQQ) has been the strongest area of the equity market in 2023 thanks to the strength of sectors like Tech (XLK) and Communication Services (XLC). Although those sectors have posted strong gains this year, they have been the weakest over the past three years while Energy (XLE) far and away has been the strongest asset class. Paired with the strength of energy stocks has been solid runs in commodities (DBC)more broadly with the notable exception being Natural Gas (UNG) which has lost over 40%. Bond ETFs are similarly sitting on losses since the COVID Crash lows. As for international markets, Mexico (EWW) and India (PIN) have outpaced the rest of the world although Emerging Markets (EEM) as a whole have not been particularly strong; likely being dragged on by the weaker performance of China (ASHR) which holds a large weight on EEM.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/032423-COVID-Low.png))**\n\n> Taking a look at current S&P 500 members, nearly half of the index has more than doubled over the past three years. As for the absolute best performers, Energy stocks dominate the list with four of the top five best-performing S&P 500 stocks coming from that sector. Targa Resources (TRGP) has been the absolute best performer with a nearly 900% total return. Other notables include a couple of heavy weight stocks: Tesla (TSLA) and NVIDIA (NVDA) with gains of 563.9% and 412.9%, respectively.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/032423-COVID-Low-2.png))**\n\n> On the other end of the spectrum, there are currently 25 stocks that have posted a negative return since the COVID Crash low. The worst has been First Republic Bank (FRC) which has been more of a recent development. Whereas today the stock has posted an 83.1% loss, at the start of this month it would have been a 65% gain. Another standout on the list of worst performers has been Amazon (AMZN). Most other mega caps have more than doubled since the March 2020 S&P 500 low, however, the e-commerce giant has hardly offered a positive return.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/032423-COVID-Low-3.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Sector Performance Experiences a Historical Divergence\n\n> The first quarter of 2023 is coming to a close next week, and checking in on year to date performance, there has been a big divergence between the winners and losers. Although the S&P 500 is up 2.84% on the year as of yesterday's close, only three of the eleven sectors are higher. Not only are those three sectors up on the year, but they have posted impressive double digit gains only three months into the year. Of those three, Consumer Discretionary has posted the smallest gain of 10% whereas Technology and Communication Services have risen 17.2% and 18.1%, respectively. The fact that these sectors are home to the main mega cap stocks -- like Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), and Alphabet (GOOGL), which have been on an impressive run of late -- helps to explain how the market cap weighted S&P 500 is up on the year without much in the way of healthy breadth on a sector level.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/032423-Sector-1a.png))**\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/032423-Sector-1.png))**\n\n> One thing that is particularly remarkable about this year's sector performance is just how rare it is for a sector to be up 10%+ (let alone 3) while all other sectors are lower. And that is for any point of the year let alone in the first quarter. As we mentioned in yesterday's Sector Snapshot and show in the charts below, going back to 1990, there have only been two other periods in which a sector has risen at least 10% YTD while all other sectors were lower YTD. The first of those was in May 2009. In a similar instance to now, Consumer Discretionary, Tech, and Materials were the three sectors with double digit gains back then. With those sectors up solidly, the S&P 500 was little changed on the year with a less than 1% gain. As you can see below, though, by the end of 2009, every sector had pushed into positive territory as the new bull market coming out of the global financial crisis was well underway.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/032423-Sector-2.png))**\n\n> The next occurrence was much more recent: 2022. Obviously, it was a tough year for equities except for the Energy sector which had a banner year. Throughout most of the year, the sector traded up by well over 20% year to date even while the rest of the equity market was battered.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/032423-Sector-3.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # The Fed Expects Banking Stress to Substitute for Rate Hikes\n\n> The Federal Reserve raised the federal funds rate by 0.25% at their March meeting, bringing it to the 4.75-5.0% range. This is the ninth-straight rate increase and brings rates to their highest level since 2007. However, the most aggressive tightening cycle since the early 1980s, which saw them lift rates all the way from near zero to almost 5%, is near its end.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Blog-2023-03-23-Fed-target-rate-601x800.png))**\n\n> Up until early February, Fed officials expected to raise rates to a maximum of about 5.1% and hold it there for a while. However, since that time, we\u2019ve gotten a slew of strong economic data, including elevated inflation numbers. This pushed fed officials to give \u201cguidance\u201d that they expected to raise rates by more than they estimated back in December.\n\n> Market expectations for policy also moved in conjunction. Prior to February, markets expected the Fed to raise rates to 5% by June, and subsequently lower them by about 0.5% by the end of the year. But strong incoming data and Fed guidance pushed expectations higher, with the terminal rate moving up to 5.6% and no cuts in 2023.\n\n> # The Silicon Valley Bank crisis changed everything\n> The bank crisis that erupted over the last couple of weeks resulted in a significant shift, both in expectations for policy and now the Fed as well. See here for our complete rundown on SVB and the ensuing crisis.\n\n> Market expectations for Fed policy rates immediately moved lower. Markets expected the stress in banks to translate to tighter credit conditions, which in turn would lead to slower economic growth and lower inflation.\n\n> This was nicely articulated by Professor Jeremey Siegel, one of the foremost commentators on financial markets and fed policy, in our latest episode of the Facts vs Feelings podcast, Prof. Siegel said that tighter credit conditions, as lending standards become more strict, are de facto rate hikes.\n\n> Fed Chair Powell more or less said exactly the same thing after the Fed\u2019s March meeting. The 0.25% increase was an attempt to thread the needle between financial stability and fighting inflation. Fed officials also forecast the fed funds rate to hit a maximum of 5.1%, unchanged from their December estimate. This is a marked shift from what was expected just a few weeks ago, with Powell explicitly saying that tighter credit conditions \u201csubstitute\u201d for rate hikes.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Blog-2023-03-23-Fed-rate-expectations-600x800.png))**\n\n> # There\u2019s a lot of uncertainty ahead\n> While the recent bank stresses are expected to tighten credit conditions and thereby impact economic growth and inflation, there are a couple of open questions:\n\n> * How big will the impact be?\n\n> * How long will the impact last?\n\n> These are unknown currently. Which means future policy is also unknown.\n\n> Fed officials expect to take rates to 5.1%, i.e., one more rate increase. And then expect to hold it there through the end of the year. In short, they don\u2019t expect rate cuts this year.\n\n> Yet investors expect no more rate increases and about 0.6% of rate cuts in the second half of 2023. Markets expect the policy rate in June to be at 4.8%, while expectations for December are at 4.2%.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Blog-2023-03-23-implied-policy-rate-differential-600x800.png))**\n\n> There\u2019s clearly a huge gulf between what the Fed expects versus what investors expect. This will have to reconcile in one of two ways:\n\n> * Market expectations move higher \u2013 if economic/inflation data remain strong and credit conditions don\u2019t look to be tightening significantly.\n\n> * Fed expectations move lower \u2013 if the banking sector comes under renewed stress, credit conditions could tighten significantly and eventually lead to weaker data.\n\n> Things are obviously not going to go in either direction in a straight line. It\u2019s going to be a bumpy ride as new data points come in, not to mention news/rumors of renewed problems in the banking sector.\n\n*****\n\n> # Seasonality Keeps Claims Below 200K?\n\n> Initial jobless claims remained healthy this week with another sub-200K print. Claims fell modestly to 191K from last week's unrevised reading of 192K. That small decline exceeded expectations of claims rising up to 197K. Given claims continue to impress, the seasonally adjusted number has come in below 200K for 9 of the last 10 weeks. By that measure, it has been the strongest stretch for claims since last April when there were 10 weeks in a row of sub-200K prints. Prior to that, from 2018 through 2020 the late March and early April period similarly saw consistent readings under 200K meaning that some of the strength in the adjusted number could be on account of residual seasonality.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/032323-Claims-1.png))**\n\n> In fact, this point of the year has some of the weeks in which claims have the most consistently historically fallen week over week. Taking a historical median of claims throughout the year, claims tend to round out a short-term bottom in the spring before an early summer bump. In other words, seasonal strength will begin to wane in the coming months.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/032323-Claims-2.png))**\n\n> While initial claims improved, continuing claims worsened rising to 1.694 million from 1.68 million the previous week. Albeit higher, that remains below the 2023 high of 1.715 million set at the end of February.\n\n*****\n\n> # A Fed Day Like Most Others\n\n> Yesterday's Fed decision and comments from Fed Chair Powell gave markets plenty to chew on. As we discussed in last night's Closer and today's Morning Lineup, there have been a number of conflicting statements from officials and confusing reactions in various assets over the past 24 hours. In spite of all that uncertainty, the S&P 500's path yesterday pretty much followed the usual script. In the charts below we show the S&P's average intraday pattern across all Fed days since Powell has been chair (first chart) and the intraday chart of the S&P yesterday (second chart). As shown, the market's pattern yesterday, especially after the 2 PM ET rate decision and the 2:30 PM press conference, closely resembled the average path that the market has followed across all Powell Fed Days since 2018.\n\n> The S&P saw a modest bounce after the 2 PM Fed decision and then a further rally right after Powell's presser began at 2:30 PM. That initial post-presser spike proved to be a pump-fake, as markets ultimately sold off hard with a near 2% decline from 2:30 PM to the 4 PM close.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/032323-Fed-Comp-1a.png))**\n\n> So what typically happens in the week after Fed days? Since 1994 when the Fed began announcing policy decisions on the same day as its meeting, the S&P has averaged a decline of 10 basis points over the next week. During the current tightening cycle that began about a year ago, market performance in the week after Fed days has been even worse with the S&P averaging a decline of 0.99%. However, when the S&P has been down over 1% on Fed days (like yesterday), performance over the next week has been positive with an average gain of 0.64%. As always, past performance is no guarantee of future results.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/032323-Fed-Comp-3.png))**\n\n***** \n\n> # What Now? An Update on Recent Bank Stress.\n\n> It\u2019s been less than 2 weeks since Silicon Valley Bank\u2019s stunning 48-hour collapse, and a few more banks have been caught in the fray. New York regulators closed the doors on Signature Bank on Sunday, March 12. A week later, US banks injected $30 billion into First Republic Bank to keep it afloat, and UBS acquired rival Swiss bank Credit Suisse in a government-brokered deal. In the midst of the chaos, your Carson Investment Research team was there for you with client-facing content, professional advice, and investment solutions. In fact, we think this event presents an opportunity to invest in the more stable large-cap financial companies and recently upgraded the sector to overweight in our House Views Advice.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Mar22_1-1600x927.png))**\n\n> # Why is this happening?\n> The rapid hike in interest rates caused an asset and liability mismatch for banks. Due to many years of low-interest rates, banks invested assets in interest-earning loans and bonds that would be repaid over the next five-plus years, which at the time was a logical way to earn a higher yield. Regulators considered government bonds to be among the safest ways a bank could invest its capital. As interest rates rose, bond values dropped. Interest rates rose at the fastest pace in history, and the safe assets that banks invested in lost value to the tune of more than $620 billion in unrealized losses as of the end of last year. This decline in value left weaker banks underwater and, when coupled with depositors pulling money out, caused them to collapse or seek costly capital raises.\n\n> # Why this matters to investors?\n> The weakness in the banking sector will likely lead to tighter lending standards, potentially slowing economic growth. The reason we\u2019re in this mess, to begin with, is that the Fed hiked interest rates to slow the economy because inflation was rising too quickly. Perhaps the 16% drop in oil prices over the past two weeks reflected this slower growth and bodes well for continued falling inflation. Thus, the Fed is closer to achieving its goal.\n\n> Maybe it\u2019s an overreaction as \u201cbanking crisis\u201d headlines stir painful memories of 2008. Either way, an environment with slower growth and lower inflation isn\u2019t a bad time to invest. Bonds and stocks could both perform well, especially stocks of companies with the ability to grow earnings. We also reiterate our House Views Advice overweight on the large-cap Financials sector. The largest US banks are well-capitalized and are gaining market share from the smaller regional banks. We believe this calamity provides an opportunity for stronger banks and investors to capitalize on.\n\n*****\n\n> # FANG+ Flying\n\n> As we noted in today's Morning Lineup, sector performance has heavily favored areas like Tech, Consumer Discretionary, and Communication Services in recent weeks. Playing into that sector level performance has been the strength of the mega-caps. The NYSE FANG+ index tracks ten of the largest and most highly traded Tech and Tech-adjacent names. In the past several days, that cohort of stocks is breaking out to the highest level since last April whereas the S&P 500 still needs to rally 4% to reach its February high.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/032223-FANG-1.png))**\n\n> Although FANG+ stocks have been strong recently, that follows more than a full year of underperformance. As shown below, relative to the S&P 500, mega-cap Tech consistently underperformed from February 2021 through this past fall. In the past few days, the massive outperformance has resulted in a breakout of the downtrend for the ratio of FANG+ to the S&P 500.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/032223-FANG-2.png))**\n\n> More impressive is how rapid of a move it has been for that ratio to break out. Below, we show the 2-month percent change in the ratio above. As of the high at yesterday's close, the ratio had risen 22.5% over the prior two months. That comes up just short of the record (22.6%) leading up to the pre-COVID high in February 2020. In other words, mega-cap Tech has experienced near-record outperformance relative to the broader market. However, we would note that this is in the wake of last year when the group had seen some of its worst two-month underperformance on record with the worst readings being in March, May, and November.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/032223-FANG-3.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # March Seasonality Prevails, Banking Fiasco Be Damned\n\n> It\u2019s encouraging typical March seasonal patterns have overcome recent bank failures, recession talk and fearmongering. The early March pullback was steeper than normal, but the usual mid-month rebound appears to be materializing.\n\n> Last week\u2019s gains could be an indication we have seen the worst of the banking fallout and the end of the pullback. Triple Witching Weeks have tended to be down in flat periods and dramatically so during bear markets. Positive March Triple Witching weeks in 2003 and 2009 confirmed the market was back in rally mode.\n\n> The week after March Triple Witching is notoriously nasty. S&P is down 27 of the last 40 year \u2013 and frequently down sharply. Positive or flat action this week would be constructive.\n\n> In the old days March used to come in like a bull and out like a bear. Nowadays March has evolved into an inflection point where short-term trends often change course. The market is clearly at an important juncture and it\u2019s a good time to remember Warren Buffet\u2019s wise words to \u201cBe greedy when others are fearful.\u201d\n\n> Bank failures are never a good thing, but the swift actions of regulators likely prevented further damage to the industry. At the least, the banks are likely to be under even greater scrutiny going forward. In the near-term we expect more volatile trading. Further out we expect the market, and the economy will recover like they both have historically done.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/5fe6f3377343f819ff93c97e8aeb8ffc/1258a39f06bd18c7-63/s500x750/303b38d927e1a424f5dc254dd086678978f2cc12.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Nasdaq Leaves the S&P in the Dust\n\n> Looking at the major US index ETF screen of our Trend Analyzer shows just how disconnected the Nasdaq 100 (QQQ) has become from other major index ETFs recently. As shown below, as of Friday's close, QQQ actually finished in overbought territory (over 1 standard above its 50-DMA) whereas many other major index ETFs were oversold, some of those to an extreme degree. On a year to date basis, the Nasdaq 100 (QQQ) has rallied more than 14% compared to low single digit gains or losses for the rest of the pack.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/usindexqqq.png))**\n\n> Historically, the major indices, namely the S&P 500 and Nasdaq, tend to trade at similar overbought and oversold levels. In the chart below we show the Nasdaq 100 and S&P 500's distance from their 50-DMAs (expressed in standard deviations) over the past five years. As shown, typically the two large cap indices have seen similar albeit not identical readings. That is until the past few weeks in which the two have diverged more significantly.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/032023-SPX-NDX-2.png))**\n\n> On Friday there was more than 2 standard deviations between the Nasdaq's overbought 50-DMA spread and the S&P 500's oversold spread. As shown in the chart below, that surpassed recent highs in the spread like the spring of 2020 to set the highest reading since October 2016.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/032023-SPX-NDX-2.png))**\n\n> Going back to 1985, the spread between the Nasdaq and S&P 500 50-DMA spreads diverging to such a degree is not without precedent, but it is also not exactly common. Friday marked the 16th time that spread eclipsed 2 standard deviations for the first time in at least 3 months. Relative to those prior instances, the current overbought and oversold readings in both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq are relatively middling. However, only the instance in early 2000 similarly saw the Nasdaq technically overbought (trading at least a standard deviation above its 50-DMA) while the S&P 500 was simultaneously oversold (at least one standard deviation below its 50-DMA).\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/mconM20.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/B9lJ6yg.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/kQxLMVP.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # (T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n**(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)** (T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.).\n\n> #([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://charts.finviz.com/chart.ashx?t=SPY&ty=c&ta=st_c,sch_200p,sma_50,sma_200,sma_20,sma_100,bb_20_2,rsi_b_14,macd_b_12_26_9,stofu_b_14_3_3&p=d&s=l))\n\n*****\n\n# DISCUSS!\n\nWhat are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?\n\n*****\n\nI hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great trading week ahead r/stocks. :)",

    "title": "Keep portfolio / Sell portfolio and put all into Term Deposits. What would you do?",
    "selftext": "Hi guys! I'm looking for some advice / points of view on something. For the last couple of weeks i've been thinking and thinking what i should do with my portfolio / investment strategy. So, I'm from Europe, and i currently have some money invested into the US market + some spare money (I'll show the percentages below). Right know, i have some spare money and i have the possibility to it into some Term deposits with maturity from 1 month, up to 3 years, which i think pays out quite good or just keep DCA into the market.\n\nOk so first, my portfolio right now is still positive overall and it looks like this: VOO - 25%, QQQ - 18%, NVDA - 12%, AAPL - 11%, MSFT - 10%, GOOGL - 7%, RKLB - 3%, UNH - 3% and the rest 11% split into V, ASTS, MA, HD, AMZN, TGT, DIS, BA and TSLA. For the past year or so, i didn't add anything to individual stocks and just DCA into VOO/QQQ every month.\n\nNow, the banks right now have these interests (i've selected from different banks, the best ones for each maturity period): 1 month - 5.7%, 3 months - 7.3%, 6 months - 7.5%, 1 year - 8.2%, 2 years - 8.45%, 3 years - 8.7%. But before you say holy s\\*\\*t, these are good returns, right now, here, the inflation rate is at 15% (which in reality i think it's even worse), so it's not that great if you look at it that way.\n\nLooking at the market right now, 7.5% or 8.2% seems pretty good. I know the market average return is around 8% to 9% but I'm not sure the market is gonna have these kind of returns (at least the next few years?). But i could be right, i could be wrong of course. I just don't feel like it's gonna do great next period, that's all.\n\nSo now back to my dilemma... As i said, for the past year i just DCA each month into VOO/QQQ. Besides what's already invested, i have some spare cash i would like to deploy right now and i see these scenarios.\n\n\\- Sell the portfolio, and put it all + spare money + new money each month into term deposits (6 months or 1 year maturity)\n\n\\- Keep portfolio as it is and put spare money + new money each month into term deposits\n\n\\- Keep portfolio and put the spare money into it + DCA each month as usual and ignore the term deposits\n\nIf i missed something, maybe a better option or some information that i missed and might be really important to take into consideration, please tell me. Right now i'm something like 60/40 into second scenario. Just don't touch the portfolio, but put the rest of the money into these deposits (i was thinking the 1 year one may be the best one ?), until the market stabilizes a bit. Also, im in my twenties, so my investment hold period is long. I don't need the money any time soon (that's 1 of the reason why i think the option to keep DCA into the market may be better because of the compound interest?).\n\nI could really use some advice on this guys. What would you do in this situation? Sorry if some terms are not right or something, as im not from US, some things related to investing may be different and i might wrongly translate them. Thanks a lot guys!\n\nTLDR: You have spare money right now. How you choose to use it? Sell portfolio and put everything into Term deposits (at least for the next couple of years) / Keep portfolio and put rest into Term deposits / Ignore the Term deposits and keep DCA into the market as usual.",

    "selftext": "We have some vested AMZN RSUs that have been pretty stagnant but I\u2019m bullish on the company and we\u2019re plenty diversified so we\u2019re holding. \n\n\n\n\nAbout a month ago I was reading some covered call strategies and AMZN stood out as a decent company to sell covered calls on. So I tried it weekly for the last month, on Friday I\u2019d sell a CC for the next Friday from $130-248 each. After rolling the cost and putting aside some money for the tax man I came out with about $440. That\u2019s just under 2% return for the month. \n\n\n\nIf I do this every month and let the cash sit in a money market or reinvest I come out with a pretty healthy profit. Now I just have the 100 shares so it is a bit of effort for just $440/mn but we have more vesting soon and once we get 200-300 shares that\u2019s not bad. \n\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s where it\u2019s free money:\n\n\n1. I\u2019ll get this out of the way: I\u2019m completely fine if these get called and I have to sell. It\u2019s been an underperformed and was \u201cfree\u201d to begin with. I\u2019m not expecting amzn to have a crazy week and I miss out on a double. \n\n\n\n\n2. I\u2019ve been selling 232.5 and 235 calls. Amazon has struggled to pass the $240 and only a few times in the last year did it get to $235+ making it fairly unlikely for it then to be called.\n\n\n\n3. AMZN shouldn\u2019t have many unexpected upside moves, it\u2019s just not historically likely. Making it somewhat safe. However it does tend to float between $215-230 meaning this should be a fairly sustainable approach for me to keep doing every week or two.\n\n\n\n\nI\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m missing something obvious? Like the biggest risks are losing out on future gains of the shares if it gets called and taxes right? But the taxes are factored in and the return is still decent and the future gains I\u2019m just not particularly worried about and it seems I\u2019d be able to buy back in. I\u2019m genuinely open to advice if I\u2019m fucking something up, but I don\u2019t think I am and it seems like a solid strategy. ",

    "selftext": "I\u2019m looking for a gut-check on a simple plan. I have an IRA (\\~$80k) and a taxable brokerage (\\~$267k) with Morgan Stanley. Both are managed accounts. Right now about 60% of the portfolio equity is effectively tied to big tech/AI (mag7). I\u2019d like to cut that concentration, move to a fund-only setup, and keep costs low. Also somewhat of a hedge towards AI bubble burst.\n\nTarget mix (household level)\n\n* 75% U.S. large cap\n   * 50% core (S&P 500 or total market: VOO/VTI or equivalents)\n   * 25% \u201ctop-7 light\u201d allocation to reduce reliance on AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, AMZN, NVDA, META, TSLA (leaning XMAG; open to RSP if that\u2019s cleaner)\n* 25% diversifiers\n   * 10% value (VTV or IWD)\n   * 5% mid cap (VO or IJH)\n   * 4% small cap (VB or IJR)\n   * 6% international (VXUS or IXUS)\n\nHow I\u2019d implement\n\n* IRA: start with XMAG only (no S&P/total market in IRA) to cut the mega-cap tilt fast with no tax hit. \n* Taxable: keep the S&P/total-market core (VOO/VTI) and systematically exit all single-stock positions, prioritizing the big tech names first. Do it tax-sensitively with about $10\u201315k per year in realized gains, have dividends go to cash to fund the new ETFs, and aim to finish in roughly three years.\n\nMy rationale for this vs just holding S&P 500?\n\n* Keeps broad U.S. exposure but dials down single-name risk.\n* XMAG (or equal-weight) helps with the current top-heavy market.\n* The diversifier slice is pretty boilerplate imo. \n\nQuestions:\n\n1. Does this combo (core + XMAG + value/mid/small/international) seem like a sensible way to cut big-tech exposure? Not a full divestment (though I'd like to - it's too risky of a bet), but a reduction in overexposure.\n2. For placement, would you park value/mid/small in the IRA and leave international in taxable for the foreign tax credit, or is that not worth optimizing?\n3. Is \\~$10\u201315k per year in realized gains and a \\~3-year glidepath a reasonable way to unwind single stocks in taxable?\n4. End stage I'd like to remove the \"managed\" signifier from these two accounts entirely. Has anyone had luck asking for a reduced brokerage fee or flat/retainer model for the advisors? How would you recommend I broach this full strategy with them?\n5. Should I deploy something similar with my 403b (if the available funds allow)?\n6. Anything else I'm missing?",

I look at VOO, which has great consistency with 15% gains over that time, but it's obviously not as good as AMZN has performed.\n\nI know past performance does not equate to future gains, but I have a hunch AMZN has a lot of growth ahead with their investment in AI, robotics, satellites, etc. \n\nWhat would you do?

    "selftext": "A lot is being said about the high valuations and long outperformance of the tech stocks and how risky and overvalued they are as a bunch. But there's an enormous difference just among the top 10 tech stocks by size.\n\nTSLA is trading at a PE of 177 which doesn't make the remotest bit of sense based on the business that they are in (cars) and could be in (robotaxis, robots, and AI), even if they were wildly successful in new business areas (in which they face stiff competition) there is no way to justify the current valuation.\n\nPLTR's PE is over 600 not much more I need to say about that.\n\nGOOG is trading at a PE of 21. Its core search business is going to be disrupted by AI but it is still entrenched and they have the time and resources to adapt. Meanwhile they own the largest streaming platform in YouTube, and arguably the most actually successful robotaxi business in Waymo. If they were ever split up the parts would be worth far more than the sum.\n\nAAPL's heyday is behind it since their growth is anchored in devices and they will probably never acquire significantly more market share in phones meanwhile they have to create a new Fortune 500 sized business every year just to try to keep the growth going.\n\nAMZN on the other hand is not bound by any particular industry or market. They are getting into satellites, pharmaceutical delivery, health care, and can pick any large market they want to address.\n\nMSFT's new leadership after the atrocious Ballmer has brought the company into huge new markets and they are well positioned to capitalize on AI, with a PE of 39 they are not cheap but by far not the most expensive with solid growth prospects.\n\nI personally think that social media is a scourge upon the earth and is destroying the minds of young and old people alike, but META has essentially monopolies that will not be disrupted. \n\nMeanwhile these companies are investing nearly $300 billion in cap ex per year and have returned nearly $1 trillion to shareholders in buybacks and dividends over the past 5 years. These aren't unprofitable \"dot com bubble\" stocks but entrenched cash cows.",

    "selftext": "About a year ago, I took over my traditional IRA which had been professionally managed for a good while. It has a wide range of individual stocks like AAPL, AMD, AMZN, AVGO, AXP, BRKB, COST, CRM ... V, WBA, WMT (28 stocks and funds) for example, with share quantities ranging from 1 to 20+ for the individual stocks. Most, have really nice returns, but the quantity of each tends to be so small I question whether it would be wise to sell most and invest in a mix of SCHD, FXAIX, SCHG, FTEC, and FBGRX. I've already cleaned up a bunch of small quantity positions, but there are still a ton of them. I reinvested the proceeds into the funds above.\n\nWould it make sense to sell most of these remaining small positions and concentrate those funds in selected ETFs and MFs as mentioned above? I've pretty much settled other Roth and IRA accounts into a mix of S&P 500, dividend ETFs, and growth funds. But this one account remains to be cleaned up and is worth around $135k-ish currently. \n\nI'm not generally a fan of bond funds, but do have about 6% in FXNAX. I've consolidated other stocks I sold into FXAIX and SCHD, about 27% and 29% respectively. And I put some in several growth funds too like FBGRX and FTEC, about 16% between them. So the remaining 20+ stocks comprise maybe 20-25% of the account. While I kinda like having BRKB, MSFT, NFLX, NVDA, META, etc., the share quantities are so low that I wonder if I would be better off selling them and reinvesting them in my core ETFs and MFs above. \n\nFor the record, our current income is from Social Security, RMDs, and my wife who will likely work for 6 to 8 more years. I've been retired for years. The majority of our funds are in different Roth and 403b Roth and 403b IRA accounts. The account in question above is a rollover from a job years ago.",

In the short term, trading correlations may make the portfolio move together, longer term cash flows and profits will drive the stock and diversification will come from diversifying those cash flows.\n",

The goal was to understand how regularity and patience could yield results. I confess that I rebalanced twice, but I can\u2019t remember when exactly (oops!).\n\nThis wasn\u2019t my only investment, and its sole purpose was to see how it would perform over the course of a year. It\u2019s not an allocation I plan to keep in the future.\n\n**Results**:\n\n* I invested a total of\u00a0**\u20ac520**\u00a0throughout the year.\n* The current portfolio value is\u00a0**\u20ac706.80**, which means a profit of\u00a0**\u20ac186.80**\u00a0(+35.92% return).\n\n**Key Takeaways**:\n\n* **Consistency works:**\u00a0Investing small amounts regularly helps avoid timing the market. DCA (Dollar-Cost Averaging) for the win!\n* **Stock selection matters:**\u00a0The \"Magnificent 7\" are heavily exposed to the tech sector, which had a strong year, but that also means higher volatility.\n* **Patience is key:**\u00a0I didn\u2019t touch the investments throughout the year, and that was crucial for these results.\n\nThis was a personal experiment that helped me learn more about the impact of regular investing and how the market can reward those who stick to a disciplined strategy.\n\nIt\u2019s just my experience\u2014not right, not wrong\u2014just mine, and I wanted to share it with you!\n\n**Discussion**:  \nHas anyone else here tried investment \"experiments\" like this?

    "selftext": "Hope everyone had a great week and a great start to the New Year! I was able to contribute another $1,000 to my brokerage account this week. Here's the key highlights.\n\n**December 30 Balance:** $129,157.32  \n**January 3 Balance:** $134,381.97  \n**Weekly Contribution:** $1,000\n\nThis week was a roller coaster. My account dropped as low as $127,242.76 before rebounding on Friday. I try not to check my account every day to avoid the temptation of panic selling. The volatility can be tough to watch, but I try to stay focused on the long-term prospects of my holdings.\n\nWhen I had my cash available, I purchased more MSTR since it took a substantial dip. I lowered my cost average down to $417.78, which is a realized loss of 18.7%. I will continue adding to this position as long as it is lower than my cost average. I now hold 49.138 shares.\n\nI am also going to explore write some covered calls against a few of my holdings. I do this in my retirement account regularly, but I haven't done it much in my brokerage account because of tax implications. I will post updates if I decide to do that. I would love to generate some extra cash to begin buying some non-tech stocks and diversify the portfolio. As many of you stated last week, I certainly felt the effects of not diversifying when the NASDAQ was hammered in the middle of the week. I like some of the ideas people proposed last week, and I have added them to my watch list. If you have any other ideas that look good for 2025, please let me know in the comments.\n\nIt's also becoming very tempting to sell my LUNR contracts. They are up 650% since I purchased them, but I am trying to hold them through the launch later this month. We will see if that actually happens, or I might sell off two of my contracts to lock in gains and let the other two ride.\n\nHere's an overview of my holdings. The only change was adding more MSTR this week.\n\n**Current Holdings:**  \n\\- QQQ: 101.714 shares worth $52,832.41  \n\\- AMZN: 101.565 shares worth $22,769.85  \n\\- MSTR: 49.138 shares worth $16,690.21  \n\\- PANW: 80 shares worth $14,660.00.  \n\\- NVDA: 100.374 shares worth $14,501.03  \n\\- LUNR Call: 4 contracts (March 2025, $6 strike) worth $6,300  \n\\- CRWD: 10.753 shares worth $3,860.54  \n\\- META: 3.867 shares worth $2,338.10  \n\\- TGTX Call: 3 contracts (February 2025, $37 strike) worth $429.00\n\nDate\tAccount Balance (USD)\n\nNov 8. 2023\t$42,657.61\n\nDec 1, 2023\t$49,538.85\n\nJan 2, 2024\t$55,890.56\n\nFeb 1, 2024\t$64,396.23\n\nMar 1, 2024\t$67,122.01\n\nApr 1, 2024\t$70,912.97\n\nMay 1, 2024\t$71,600.58\n\nJun 3, 2024\t$83,827.81\n\nJul 1, 2024\t$91,752.40\n\nAug 1, 2024\t$91,752.40\n\nSep 3, 2024\t$98,283.78\n\nOct 1, 2024\t$105,701.36\n\nNov 1, 2024\t$115,481.05\n\nDec 2, 2024\t$127,155.13\n\nJan 3, 2025     $34,381.97\n\nLooking forward to seeing how the next few weeks unfold.

    "selftext": "NuBank ($NU)\n\nWith Brazil\u2019s macroeconomic conditions stabilizing, this is my most confident investment for the next five years. Currently, ARPAC is $11, dragged down by customer acquisition costs in Mexico and Colombia. Over the next 3\u20135 years, ARPAC should surpass $25, with customer numbers growing at an annual rate of 15\u201320%.\n\nTransMedics($TMDX)\n\nFourth-quarter flight data for $TMDX shows the expected seasonal decline. With an enterprise value/EBITDA ratio of 25.6x and EBITDA expected to grow at over 50% annually, this growth rate and valuation multiple are hard to ignore. Management has also announced plans to expand into international markets, offering massive growth potential.\n\nLemonade ($LMND)\n\nI haven\u2019t talked much about $LMND before, so here\u2019s a quick breakdown:\n\n1) Growth spending increased by 40%\n\n2) Positive free cash flow inflection point\n\n3) EBITDA breakeven expected before 2026 \n\n$LMND is nearing a turning point, and its true strength will soon become evident.\n\nPayPal ($PYPL)\n\nI\u2019ve been buying $PYPL since early 2024. Management is laser-focused on sustainable profitability. If they achieve $10 billion in EBITDA by 2027, at 15x enterprise value/EBITDA, the company would be valued at $150 billion\u2014about 70% higher than its current valuation.\n\nSoFi Technologies ($SOFI)\n\nWhile there\u2019s less buzz around $SOFI now compared to when its stock traded at $7\u2013$8, it still has significant growth and efficiency potential. A key difference since August is that institutional investors have started buying this stock in bulk. I believe a $40 price target for $SOFI is reasonable.\n\nAIX ($AIFU)\n\nAs the largest insurance brokerage in China, $AIFU\u2019s market cap is only about $60 million. Its September 18 half-year report shows $110 million in cash and short-term investments, meaning its market cap is just 60% of its cash holdings\u2014a clear undervaluation. Additionally, the recent transaction with pharmaceutical company $BGM, securing control of a listed company, is expected to boost net profits by at least $58 million. A short-term rebound to $2 seems very achievable.\n\nAmazon ($AMZN)\n\nThe valuation of AWS alone should nearly equal the company\u2019s current total valuation. With its proprietary chips and robotics, $AMZN has immense efficiency-boosting potential. Profit margin expansion, strong AWS growth, and a high free cash flow core business make this a solid investment case.\n\nASML ($ASML)\n\nAs $ASML transitions its business toward EUV technology, one of the world\u2019s largest monopolies will only grow stronger. If $ASML hits $60 billion in revenue by 2030 (upper estimate) with a 40% EBITDA margin, that\u2019s $24 billion in EBITDA. At 25x enterprise value/EBITDA, its valuation could reach $600 billion\u20142.2x its current level. A high-confidence opportunity.\n\nMercadoLibre ($MELI)\n\nBy 2027, the Latin American e-commerce market is projected to reach $350 billion. With a 30% market share, $MELI\u2019s e-commerce business alone could represent a $105 billion market opportunity. Currently, $MELI\u2019s entire market cap is just $90 billion. Add Mercado Pago, advertising, and logistics, and it\u2019s clear $MELI is deeply undervalued.\n\nHims & Hers ($HIMS)\n\nCategory and international expansion present huge opportunities, while LLMs will enhance efficiency, improve cross-selling, and optimize the overall business model. While the GLP-1 narrative drives short-term price action, it\u2019s only a small part of the long-term thesis.",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone!   \n  \nI am a longtime lurker, but I am hopeful people may feel inspired by financial journey over the last year or so.   \n  \nFor background, I\u2019m an assistant principal at a local elementary school, and my wife runs her own tutoring and education consulting business. Together, we\u2019ve been focused on building a secure financial future while balancing busy lives. This post is part of my ongoing journey of consistent investing. As of November 13, 2023, I began contributing $1,000 weekly to my brokerage account. Previously, I had dabbled in investing since 2021 but without consistency.  I deposited a little extra money here and there, but I wasn't consistent in my approach and didn't prioritize it. This is my story and an update on where I stand today.\n\n**Portfolio Snapshot as of December 2024:**  \n  \nStarting Balance (November 13, 2023): $44,403.12  \nCurrent Balance (December 26, 2024): $131,615.84\n\n**Monthly Contributions:** $4,000 - $5,000 (depending on the number of weeks per month)\n\n**Current Holdings:**  \n\\- QQQ: 101.714 shares worth $53,151.66  \n\\- AMZN: 101.565 shares worth $22,725.16  \n\\- MSTR: 45.279 shares worth $14,942.07  \n\\- PANW: 80 shares worth $14,894.40  \n\\- NVDA: 100.374 shares worth $13,752.24  \n\\- LUNR Call: 4 contracts (March 2025, $6 strike) worth $5,000  \n\\- CRWD: 10.753 shares worth $3,817.20   \n\\- META: 3.867 shares worth $2,319.46  \n\\- TGTX Call: 3 contracts (February 2025, $37 strike) worth $825.00\n\n**Table of Progress:**\n\n|Date|Account Balance (USD)|\n|:-|:-|\n|Nov 8. 2023|$42,657.61|\n|Dec 1, 2023|$49,538.85|\n|Jan 2, 2024|$55,890.56|\n|Feb 1, 2024|$64,396.23|\n|Mar 1, 2024 |$67,122.01|\n|Apr 1, 2024|$70,912.97|\n|May 1, 2024|$71,600.58|\n|Jun 3, 2024|$83,827.81|\n|Jul 1, 2024|$91,752.40|\n|Aug 1, 2024|$91,752.40|\n|Sep 3, 2024|$98,283.78|\n|Oct 1, 2024|$105,701.36|\n|Nov 1, 2024|$115,481.05|\n|Dec 2, 2024|$127,155.13|\n\n**Lessons Learned:**\n\n\\- **Compounding Takes Time but Works:** I\u2019ve started noticing compounding effects really kick in. Some months, my portfolio\u2019s growth outpaced my monthly salary, which is both surreal and inspiring.\n\n\\- **Volatility is Real:** Watching significant swings in my portfolio value is tough. To manage this, I\u2019ve adopted a \"set it and forget it\" mindset and avoid checking my account daily.\n\n**- Stay Consistent:** It\u2019s easy to get caught up in market trends and daily life, but staying consistent with contributions has been the most rewarding strategy.\n\n**Why I\u2019m Sharing:**\n\nI hope to inspire others who might be hesitant about investing. I realize $1,000 isn't possible for everyone - I'm extremely lucky to be able to do this - but I think starting with even $50 a week or a month can be impactful. Financial independence is achievable with consistency, discipline, and patience. \n\nFor transparency, I focus solely on my brokerage account in these posts, even though I also fully fund my Roth IRA, 403(b), and my wife\u2019s self-directed 401(k). We also maintain a hands-off Acorns account with about $60,000. I\u2019ve thought about moving that money to Fidelity but appreciate the safety and simplicity it offers.\n\n**Looking Ahead:**\n\nStarting in January, I plan to post each week to give a closer look at my journey. I\u2019ll share more details on my strategy and lessons as they unfold.\n\nIf you have questions about my approach, portfolio, or anything else, feel free to ask! Thanks for following along, and good luck on your own investing journeys!",

I'm also working on a\u00a0self-funded AI startup, which keeps me in the loop on AI.\n\nReturns have been strong and continue to give me the runway to work on my startup and support my family after leaving my corporate tech job.

This approach is considered risky, but I have strong conviction in their relative valuation, defensibility, and long-term prospects.\n\nIn this case I believe that 'diversification' among AI stocks would do more to dilute my returns than mitigate my risks. Particularly because they're all highly correlated and despite its market cap, Nvidia has the most reasonable valuation all things considered. We'll see if the bet pays off.\n\nTo clarify, I am confident in the long-term prospects of Palantir, Tesla, and others, but I'm just not comfortable with the valuations. I may reassess in the future when I have new information or valuations change.\n\nMeta is the only other stock I held onto, given my bullish view on their AI and hardware strategy combined with their attractive valuation.\n\n# Unrealized (current investments)\n\n* **Meta (META):**\u00a0\\+367.97%\n* **Nvidia (NVDA):**\u00a0\\+117.05%\n\nNvidia's performance here is understated since I recently increased my holdings, but it's up \\~200% since I initially purchased it last year after\u00a0dithering for months.\n\nThese returns are less impactful without the values or relative weights, but I\u2019d like to maintain some anonymity around it.\n\n# Rate of return (IRR)\n\nMy annual return (IRR) for this portfolio (Jun 2022 to Dec 2024) is\u00a0**73.6%**.\n\n# Investment thesis\n\nSee a summary of my investment thesis in a\u00a0[previous update](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/17mzc07/15_year_followup_on_buying_the_dip_on_pandemic/).\u00a0**TL;DR:**\n\n>\u201c\u2026AI is another secular trend like PCs (Windows, Mac), the internet (browsers, search, social) and mobile (iOS, Android, wearables). The difference is that new technology like AI can now spread faster than ever before and get used in new ways. Every new epoch uniquely benefits from the past, potentially bending the growth curve in new ways.\n\n>The other difference is that Nvidia has a monopoly position on the core technology driving this innovation. Therefore, the \\~350% run up over the last 12 months doesn\u2019t make NVIDIA the stock of the last year, but rather it\u2019s the stock of the next decade. The recent 3X gain will be a blip compared to what\u2019s coming thanks to NVIDIA\u2019s CUDA (moat), among\u00a0[other things](https://stratechery.com/2023/nvidia-on-the-mountaintop/).\u201d\n\n>\\- [1.5 year follow-up on buying the dip on pandemic stocks](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/17mzc07/15_year_followup_on_buying_the_dip_on_pandemic/), Nov. 2023\n\n# Nvidia's dominance\n\nI'm still working through my thoughts here, but my strong conviction around Nvidia comes in part from these observations:\n\n* Nvidia is\u00a0[founder-led](https://www.amazon.com/Nvidia-Way-Jensen-Huang-Making/dp/1324086718/)\u00a0and focuses on accelerated computing while remaining broad enough to allow for innovation and insight across industries where it can apply its core competencies.\n* It's unprecedented to have such dominance in such a fast-growing, valuable industry while maintaining such a long-term sustainable advantage.\n* This advantage is due to unreasonable investments (research, hardware, software, ecosystem, relationships) over decades, making it hard to copy.\n* AI will consistently make software\u00a0easier to create, thus reducing the moats of software companies and make them less attractive than hardware companies (for now).\n* Despite their impressive growth, Nvidia is still supply constrained, which is fundamentally easier to predict than demand constraints.\n\n# We still underestimate the AI opportunity\n\nMost importantly, we\u2019ve barely scratched the surface of AI\u2019s opportunities and benefits. Even the most ambitious targets underestimate it because the better and cheaper AI gets, the more use cases we'll find.\n\nWe have a habit of confusing the limits of our imagination with the limits of reality. Our imaginations are trained on what happened before, but there has never been anything like this before.\n\n# Final thoughts\n\nI'm still well within the '*maybe I'm just lucky*' phase since it's only been a couple years. Towards the end of [my last update](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1d758m7/2_year_followup_on_buying_the_dip_on_pandemic/)\u00a0I also shared a few ways my investment approach has changed, which I\u2019m still benefiting from.\n\nI expect my next update to be the 3-year update in mid 2025.\n\n**UPDATE:** Thanks for mentioning I should have included indexes for benchmark context. Indexes like QQQ and S&P 500 also had good returns during the same period (June 2022 - Dec 2024). For an apples to apples comparison, the IRR of QQQ and S&P 500 respectively during this period were \\~24% and \\~16%.",

    "selftext": "I don't know how technical I should get in this OP, but a lot of \"traditional investors\" are still too biased against bitcoin because they don't understand the technology. They are the same kind of people who said don't invest in AMZN because no body will want to buy books on these new fangled \"online stores\".\n\nWhat is the Byzantine General's problem? It's probably one of those most valuable problems in human civilization, if we were to put monetary value on it. It is a problem where one person can't trust the others in a group. It's typically encountered in complex organizations or where technology requires fidelity (Ai).\n\nSo Bitcoin can both enforce fidelity and fault tolerance across the Ai spectrum and across human civilization.\n\nThe US DoD also publishes papers on another application of Bitcoin which is cryptography, which is why almost all of the global mining is expectedly split between China, Russia and US, each controlling about 30% share. Because the three super powers recognize that a bitcoin wrapper around data effectively puts a price tag on that data.\n\nLastly, how does the mining \"subsidy work\"? Subsidy is pulled from the white paper, it's not a miner's reward, it's a subsidy.\n\nThe subsidy puts a price floor on Bitcoin by ensuring that transaction fees are not prohibitively expensive until bitcoin is large enough to make meaningful transactions.\n\nIf we think of the subsidy in terms of bitcoin only then when it first began the transaction fee was something like 50 bitcoin. Four halvings later and it went to 25, 12.5, 6.25 and now 3.125 bitcoin.\n\nSo it costs 3.125 bitcoin to transact right now, and is entirely subsidized. Think of transactions as a bank with limited teller windows and you auction aka bid the highest price for use of that teller window.\n\nTransactions take place on the Lightning network and companies like AMZN are building their own Lightning networks which are basically like owning your own credit card company where you take a fee for the use of the credit card. So companies are already branching into this.\n\nSo let's recap the technology to see how it's not a speculation at all, it's the next Ai or Internet or etc.\n\n1. It solves Byzantine General's problem solving one of the most valuable problems in human history by allowing Ai and organizations to have fidelity between systems.\n2. It is a massive cryptographic engine that puts a price tag on the value of whatever is being protected. A hacker has to spend that much money to defeat the encryption.\n3. It has aguaranted floor in price that is inverse-proportional to the cost of the transactions as measured in the Bitcoin subsidy given to miners. The fewer coin used in transaction cost at greater power usage (fiat cost) then the greater the fiat value of Bitcoin.\n4. The Lightning network is the off-chain payment method that Bitcoin uses and that generates fees for the operators of the nodes and those fees are like credit card fees generating revenue for the operators of the ecosystem.\n\nIf you ever worried about investing in Bitcoin because it's a \"Gamble\", it's no more a gamble than investing in Coca-Cola or a power plant.",

    "title": "Investment Advice- Rebalancing?",
    "selftext": "I am looking for some advice on my current portfolio and savings plan.\n\nI'm a fairly recent immigrant to this country (36m) so started my retirement/ savings from scratch in my early 30's. Currently live in a very HCOL city on the west coast, making around 100-150k/ year running my own business as an S corp, where I pay myself a W2 salary thats roughly 60% of my income, which i adjust regularly to stay ahead of taxes. The nature of my work is project based and freelance so every month is different. This year I am paying myself approx 6k gross per month on w2. The remainder of the income from the business and other 1099 income I usually manage to write off completely as I invest it back into the business.\n\nMy main expense is rent and utilities, other than that I have no other debt (paid off car, no student debt) aside from small credit card bills (under 3k that I pay off monthly- no interest)\n\n  \n**Current Accounts and Savings:**\n\n  \nPersonal Checking Account- $3k, keep this empty for monthly expenses only. Zero interest. I view this as a pass through account- salary in, bills out.\n\nBusiness Checking Account- $20k, this account fluctuates a lot depending on cash flow, I usually try to keep it around $20k- thinking I could/ should move at least 50% into an account that accrues some interest. \n\nSEP IRA (Deductible)- 25k, I max out the contribution yearly, 25% of my w2 income (started this in 2022) I divide that total amount by 12 and make 12 monthly DCA buys into VTI. That's it. Could possibly just start dropping a lump sum?\n\nROTH IRA- 18k, Maxing this out every year. $500 monthly DCA buys into VTI (50%) VOO (40%) and 10% cash.\n\nM1 Investment Account- $3k, started this is March of this year to start putting some money into some individual stocks and slightly more speculative plays. $100 weekly DCA buys into a basket of stocks MSTR, TSLA, NVDA, AMZN, AAPL, V, LLY  etc. I like to own individual names and regular DCA just keeps the guesswork out.\n\nRegular Brokerage Account- $1.5k, use this for the occasional weekly/ monthly option contract. Any gains over 1.5k just get emptied into the ROTH. I regularly generate 400-500 per month from this account, so most months i don't even need to fund my ROTH from my personal account.\n\nChase Investment Account- $14k, $400 monthly contribtions, this was a Chase Auto Invest account (mid risk) that yielded about 10%, so below avg market returns. Chase has ended this auto investment service so the money is 80% invested into various funds but the new contributions will just be cash unless i Manually buy new funds. As this has been underperforming the market, i'm thinking about splitting this up over a few of my other accounts to streamline.\n\n  \nCrypto- $20k, been buying $100 of BTC weekly for years. Occasionally add bigger lumps on big dips. Will continue this DCA strategy.\n\n  \nSo my currently contributions to all my accounts are :\n\n  \nSEP IRA- 1k monthly DCA into VTI  \nROTH IRA- $500 monthly DCA into VTI/ VOO  \nM1- $400 monthly DCA into various QQQ type stocks  \nChase Invest- $400 monthly DCA into money market  \nCrypto- $400 DCA into BTC  \n\n\nI don't really ever sell stocks or funds, unless they become seriously overweight, or I need the cash, which hasn't happened so far.\n\nI'm fairly happy with the amount that I am able to save and invest monthly, just wondering if anyone had advice on how I could streamline this approach, or if there are other account types or assets I should consider. The monthly DCA strategy just works for me because it means I really don't worry too much about market movements, I actually prefer to see prices go down so i can buy more cheaper. \n\nTLDR: Please critique my current investment strategy, are there any other account types i should be contributing to regularly to build wealth for the future and how could i manage my regular buys/ DCA/ contributions more effectively?",

    "selftext": "hey all, sharing what i'm calling my \"frontier tech\" portfolio, broken down by percentages. i'm looking for valuable input, feedback, and discussion around it. and, if it happens to be helpful to anyone, even better. i do want to clarify a few things:\n\n* i'm focused on AI, bitcoin, and space. investment vehicles or not, i simply think each are tech frontiers that hold tons of promise, are poised for massive growth, and will bring immense amounts of value to the world over the next few decades. let's just call this a \"frontier tech\" portfolio, to give it a name i can reference.\n* i'm not looking for feedback that just disagrees with that thesis. whether you think AI is all hype, or you are anti-Bitcoin and think it's a ponzi scheme, or you think space is a waste of resources, or anything along these lines - that's ok, i respect that perspective, but i'd like to avoid arguing about it. we just disagree about some fundamental things, and you won't convince me i'm simply wrong.\n* i AM looking for feedback on blind spots, poor/missing assumptions, overconfidence, things i'm not considering, or any other constructive input that falls within the framework of the overall thesis. i'm not just looking for people to agree with me (though that is interesting input as well) - i just want feedback that can be applied within my overall investing philosophy.\n* yes, i'm missing some key areas of what many would call \"frontier tech\" - biotech, green / nuclear energy, cybersecurity, to name a few - but i just don't have the same level of confidence in specific areas of those. i prefer to stay relatively focused on the categories where i'm most confident and able to stay up to date.\n* i'm trying to keep my language somewhat appealing to a wide audience. not looking to get too bogged down in technical details or language that would alienate someone reading this stuff who's less familiar with one or any of the spaces/categories.\n* my primary goal is a portfolio of funds and stocks that i can invest in with *strong long-term confidence in growth.* not stuff i trade frequently. and not stuff i love the idea of or that seems interesting / sexy but that i don't know enough about (SMCI, PLTR, altcoins as some good examples). i also generally prefer companies whose leadership i trust and/or admire.\n\nok, with that out of the way, let's dive in:\n\n**30% AI** - 10% NVDA, 5% SOXQ, 15% balanced mixed of NOW, MSFT, AAPL, GOOGL, META, AMZN\n\n* HIGH LEVEL: to me, this category is ABSOLUTELY going to change our world in fundamental ways over the next several decades. AI's potential is not chatGPT, or smarter versions of it. it's far beyond what we're seeing from LLMs today. if you listen to the engineers and operational leaders within the AI space, listen to not what they \"believe\" is gonna happen, but to what they know is coming because they've already used the tech, usually 1-2 years before the public even sees it, these people are overwhelmed, amazed, terrified, enchanted, bewildered. to me, that's just very interesting. i believe what some others do - that we're in the midst or on the verge of another technological revolution. i'm not bothered much that AI isn't monetizing in demonstrable, repeatable ways. i think there's been and continues to be enough fundamental, increasing advancement in this field that the value creation will absolutely surpass what most people think. as for the individual stocks, i'll do a quick dive here. to be clear, I don't think these are groundbreaking choices and many are very obvious. but, seems useful to give my favorite things about each:\n* 10% NVDA - these guys are and will continue to be at the center of the whole thing. their moat is extensive. it's not just GPU / blackwell demand. it's their CUDA programming language and universe, and stickiness of it. it's the long-term horizon required for their data centers that makes 5-10 year customers out of everyone who buys their stuff. it's CEO jensen pushing them and already looking for the \"next big thing.\" just a lot of confidence here.\n* 5% SOXQ - i like this semiconductor ETF a little more than SMH because it's more diverse (SMH is like 25% NVDA, which is great if i didn't already allocate so much there), and it's got a low expense ratio (0.19%). i love this exposure because the AI industry is driven by these companies (e.g. TSMC, Micron, Broadcam, Qualcomm, AMD, AMAT).\n* 15% mix of these...\n   * NOW - excellent leadership and integrated heavily with NVDA tech; will benefit hugely from AI boom with AI-driven automation\n   * META - founder-run and with a clear vision; demonstrating enormous resources and focus on building AI models, meeting consumer needs, being pioneers in tech at large\n   * AAPL - will probably benefit the most from consumer-facing AI products and implementation; strong leadership\n   * AMZN - AWS is a profit monster that will be huge for AI tools and services and data centers; logistics and ecom will be big AI beneficiaries; strong leadership\n   * MSFT - deeply embedded in the AI revolution with its investment in OpenAI + AI integration into Azure and Microsoft 365; excellent leadership\n   * GOOGL - AI pioneer with DeepMind / Brain; they still own search; have enormous amount of data; questionable leadership but I'm holding for now\n* No TSLA??? no. i just don't trust elon musk enough at this point. and i need confidence in a company's leadership for me to invest in its stock. there's a big chance i'm missing out (their robotics division might be incredible), but I'm able to sleep OK with that.\n* i'm also missing plenty of other AI picks. i know that. these are the ones i can invest in with the most confidence.\n\n**30% Bitcoin** - 25% Bitcoin itself (cold storage or an ETF), 5% MSTR\n\n* HIGH LEVEL: why Bitcoin? books have been written about it, but to shortly summarize my perspective - it's quite volatile and risky short-term, and quite growth-oriented and (thus far) safe long-term. excellent store of value. wonderful technology, math/code based, and may or may not upend some portion of the financial system. limited supply that's only decreasing over time. immutable. now adopted by many big institutions. goes on giant bull runs every 4 or so years. some days, it's hard to justify NOT putting more into this one, but for now i'm convinced that\u00a0 diversification is the better long-term play.\n* 20% Bitcoin - many would argue that holding actual Bitcoin, ideally off exchanges and on cold storage is the smartest play here. but there are also arguments for FBTC or IBIT (helpful in tax-advantaged accounts; trusting an ETF seems safer to some - very debatable). i do some cold storage, and some FBTC (they self-custody their Bitcoin, which not everyone does). either way, just Bitcoin. it's the only crypto play where my confidence level is very high.\n* 5% MSTR - this is a leveraged Bitcoin play. strong chance it outpaces BTC growth rate during bull runs. i may shift some MSTR profits to Bitcoin over time if it starts to really offset my 4:1 BTC:MSTR ratio.\n\n**30% Space** - 10% ASTS, 10% RKLB, 5% LUNR\n\n* HIGH LEVEL: the tech for space finally seems to match the potential that's been talked about for decades and decades. for a while, space-x really proved this out, almost single-handedly. but we clearly have some strong other players either in or entering the category. my favorites are these three. here's why:\n* 10% ASTS - you should read the kook report (google it) for a true deep dive, but to hit my high level points: they are pre-revenue but with the potential for MASSIVE growth. effectively, their satellite system aims to offer a global cellular network. think starlink but more b2b and generally better tech. they own tons of patents. they are 5+ years ahead of what many think will be a winner-takes-most race. their partners already include AT&T, Verizon, Vodafone, Rakuten, American Tower, Bell Canada, and more. they have excellent leadership. i find this a risky-ish play as they have tons to still accomplish, but the potential growth is enormous.\n* 10% RKLB - effectively, a space-x competitor on smaller rockets, with a fraction of the market cap and a huge runway for growth. i think still heavily undervalued today. nerdy/awesome leadership. vertically integrated. as telecom, defense, and general research spending expands to space economy, RKLB is positioned very, very well.\n* 5% LUNR - i've spent less time researching them than the other two, but my confidence level in the risk/reward is still pretty high. key player in the lunar economy - one of few companies that can deliver payloads to the moon. very niche but valuable moat. huge potential, good amount of risks ahead.\n\n**10% cash** - ...to buy them juicy dips.\n\nok, that's my \"frontier tech\" portfolio summary. to repeat - this is what i can confidently invest in for what i believe will be better-than-average returns over the next 10+ years. i recognize that this discussion didn't even really touch share price, EPS, P/E, profitability, revenue, or other key details. this just isn't the place where i'm getting into that. i can say that i'm comfortable with the financial metrics and details regarding these companies. but this discussion is mainly focused on what categories i think are poised for the most growth, and what companies/stocks/assets in those categories seem to be most positioned to lead that growth. thanks for reading.\n\n*\\*\\*\\*The information provided is for educational and informational purposes only and should not be considered financial advice.

I dedicate about 90% of my income (\\~$2100/month) towards savings goals and investments as I have a paid off car, no debt, \\~$200 bills/month, and I have a fully funded a 12 month emergency fund.\n\nRoth IRA:\n\n* Total Market Index (FZROX) - 70%\n* International Index (FTIHX) - 23%\n* US Bond Index (FXNAX) - 1%\n* Bitcoin Index (FBTC) - 6%\n\nTraditional 401(k):\n\n* S&P 500 Index (VIIIX) - 100%\n\nTraditional IRA (rollover):\n\n* Total Market Index (SWTSX) - 70%\n* International Index (SWISX) - 30%\n\nHSA:\n\n* Total Market Index (FZROX) - 70%\n* International Index (FTIHX) - 30%\n\nTaxable Account(s):\n\n* Total Market Index (VTI/SCHB) - 9.85%\n* International Index (VXUS) - 6.5%\n* S&P 500 Index (VOO/SPLG) - 21.7%\n* Nasdaq 100 Index (QQQM) - 7.15%\n* Individual Equities (MSFT, AAPL, BRKB, JPM, AMZN, etc.) - 54.8%\n\n% of Total Portfolio:\n\n* Roth IRA: 52.4%\n* Traditional 401(k): 8.7%\n* HSA: 2.2%\n* Traditional IRA: 1.5%\n* Taxable Account(s): 35.2%\n\nI obviously understand the risks associated with my \\~3% position in FBTC as well as my \\~15% position in stocks across my accounts, I'm certain that I'd like to get my crypto position to around 1-2% and my stocks to around 5% over the next 6 months. Apart from that, I do have a few questions regarding my portfolio:\n\n1. Would it be beneficial to wait until LTCG takes effect next year and sell my individual equities in order to rebalance into my index funds or bite the bullet and just sell them off now?\n2. Should I concentrate all of my bond allocation inside of my 401(k) to leave more room in my IRA for index funds? Should I have bonds at all?\n3. Should I revert back to my original investment strategy within my 401(k) of the Vanguard 2070 TDF, or remain with my S&P 500 Index?\n4. Should I reduce my 12 month emergency fund into a 6 month emergency fund and lump-sum the difference in order to rebalance?\n5. Should I just go 100% VOO in my taxable account? 50%/50% VOO/VTI? Do I need to diversify with International within this account?\n6. Should I cut back on my savings/investments and focus more on myself/education?\n\nI will be doing some rebalancing on Jan 1st and around Tax Day, so any input is appreciated on how I should move things around. Thanks for any and all advice!",

    "selftext": "Well, I am Brazilian and use a bank that still do not offer Treasury and Bonds for investing, also, we cannot access all Fixed Income ETFs at the moment. I have no will of moving away from this bank, so the question is:\n\nI am planning of investing up to US$ 5000,00, I already got around US$ 300,00 invested, varying among:\n\nFixed Income ETF: SGOV\n\nStocks: AAPL, AMZN, BRK.B\n\nETFs: DIV, SDIV (both for dividends), IVV, VOO, VTI.\n\n  \nI'm not worried about oscillating the value of those US$ 300,00, but I am about the new US$ 5000,00. If we could already invest in treasury bonds I would do so. Anyways, so what would you invest in to have the least negative oscillation possible?\n\nI was thinking about a big part in SGOV, then split a little between VOO, VTI and IVV, what do you think?\n\n  \nPS.: I just want suggestions, I am not asking for you to create a wallet for me",

    "title": "Tax implications question regarding capitol losses/gains",
    "selftext": "My RSUs and ESPP shares will be forced to sell as my company is being acquired by another (new company is not public). The price it is being sold at will leave me with an overall capitol loss of \\~20K (most long-term with some short-term shares being sold). Since this is going to happen, I'm thinking of also selling most of my other shares in which I have made long-term capitol gains (NVDA +10K, GOOG +1K, AMZN +1K, etc) and then buying all these shares back since I would like to hold onto them longer. Therefore the \\~20K in losses that I'm forced to take is somewhat \"offset\" by selling shares I've earned gains from, wiping out my capitol gains tax and having a better tax situation. Then buy back the shares I've sold from NVDA, GOOG, AMZN, etc, and I no longer have to worry about a bigger tax bill on the capitol gains when I finally do decide to sell.\n\nI don't know much about the taxing on capitol losses/gains and buying back stocks you've recently sold for a profit. So am I missing something here, is it as simple as I have stated to avoid a much higher tax bill in the future by doing this or am I way off? Also, selling shares for a profit and then buying them back the next day to lower the taxes I would pay on capitol gains tax is allowed? Or is there some rule/law that says you can't do that? Sorry for the basic questions, but this is new to me. Thanks for any help, much appreciated!",

    "selftext": "[5 years ago I wrote a list of 20 stocks](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/coz3u7/strike_it_big_stocks_for_the_next_decade_a/)\u00a0I believed were high-risk/high-reward investments into new technology for the future. I think there are some interesting lessons to learn from this. Here's where they stand now:\n\n|| || |#Ticker|2019-08-12|2024-08-12|%| |GH|$98,63|$29,00|29%| |FLXN|$11,37|$8,50|75%| |VRTX|$179,84|$468,70|261%| |OMER|$18,41|$4,12|22%| |PCRX|$40,39|$12,74|32%| |HXL|$79,89|$62,16|78%| |FMC|$85,57|$61,15|71%| |MELI|$623,55|$1.883,16|302%| |MSFT|$159,03|$406,20|255%| |AMZN|$1.784,92|$3.341,80|187%| |SHOP|$366,73|$692,90|189%| |CRM|$140,72|$252,53|179%| |SQ|$62,63|$62,14|99%| |AYX|$131,08|$48,52|37%| |PYPL|$102,72|$64,72|63%| |TTD|$255,08|$993,00|389%| |ZM|$92,16|$56,10|61%| |MDB|$143,51|$235,40|164%| |OKTA|$130,50|$89,00|68%| |ZS|$83,21|$174,00|209%| |TWLO|$131,49|$60,37|46%|\n\nAverage return: 34%  \nAverage return on \"new tech\": -19%  \nAverage return on \"efficient tech\": 60%\n\nIf you invested in SPY in the same period: 80% Edit: it's 100%\n\nSo, you could dismiss this exercise by saying \"just invest in S&P 500\". But there's this one peculiar thing: the pricing of FMC and HXL doesn't make sense.\n\nHXL grew their revenue by 23% and their EBITDA by 74%. In contrast, FMC shrank their revenue by 13% and shrank their EBITDA by a whopping 60%!  And in this period their respective stock prices performed more or less the same. One could argue that it's because investors have more trust in the future of FMC's agrucultural products than in the future of HXL's advanced materials. But I don't think this is the case, both are somewhat boring technical products that investors don't have that much insight into.\n\nNo, I think the real difference is that FMC is in the S&P 500 and HXL is not and their stock performance is propped up by investors blindly shipping capital into S&P 500 ETFs. The P/S ratio of the S&P 500 has grown by 30% since 2019 meaning you are paying 30% more for the earnings the companies generate.\n\nIt will be interesting to keep track on this effect. I think it's still on the upswing as more and more young people are entering passive investing. But I wonder what the long term effects will be. I'll look at these stocks again in 5 years.\n\nEdit: wow, reddit really chewed up my table, I'll try to fix it later in the day...",

    "title": "Analyzing the Analysts: Using average analyst price target to identify possible buying opportunities amongst the top 100 companies in the S&P",
    "selftext": "Hello everyone,\n\nI'm a lazy investor and don't like to do much due diligence, but I do like to make money. Unfortunately these two things about me are often at odds as I've lost money in the past for not doing my DD. As such, I continue to be lazy but I try and find ways to work around doing due diligence and hopefully finding loop holes.\n\nOne such way that I have been thinking about recently is using analyst ratings, reviews and price targets as a surrogate for due diligence. In essence, I try to just have these analysts do the work for me. An idea I had is that much in the same way that with those who believe in technical analysis hold that everything you need to know about a stock is baked into it's price action, and so when something good happens the stock price goes up and when something bad happens the stock price goes down, thus all you need is to analyze trends in stock price and you'll be analyzing everything about the stock by proxy, I have a thesis (or theory) that perhaps you can do the same or something similar with analyst price targets of companies.\n\nNow I know that anyone who has read this far, already thinks I'm an idiot. Many experienced individual investors probably find market analysts to be stupid and therefor I'm stupid for following their lead, but I would argue to the contrary for a few reasons. As much as I have put in a lot of effort to learn about how the market operates (been investing for the last 6 years, started learning actively about it as much as I could a couple years prior to that), there is still much I don't know as I don't have a finance or economics degree. Moreover, as bad as you may think an analyst is, they are at least competent enough to keep their job as an analyst at the investment firm that allows them to make stock price target selections. Lastly, and most importantly, what I am about to discuss below uses the aggregate of several analyst price targets so I'm not relying on a single analyst but several (probably between 10 and 40 per company). I think if two-dozen analysts are strongly in favor of a company, it is unlikely that my novice investor wisdom would have researched the company and found a flaw that they all missed.\n\nSo what I did yesterday evening was go through the top 100 S&P 500 companies by market cap and find the current average price target for them on Yahoo Finance. I then divided the current stock price (at the close on 7/31) by that price target and expressed it as a percentage to see how far off the company was from the average price target analysts were aiming for.

on this table above, I tried to identify some companies that met a few criteria. I wanted to identify companies that had at least 25% of their analyst ratings be 'Strong Buys', to have at least 20 analyst ratings available and for the current stock price to be at 90% or less of the average price target. This lead me to the following 11 companies:\nMicron Technologies (MU), Boston Scientific (BSX), Abbot Laboratories (ABT), Merck Scientific (MRK), Stryker (SYK), The Cigna Group (CI), Broadcom (AVGO), Comcast (CMCSA), Honeywell International (HON), Analogue Devices (ADI), and Intuit Inc. (INTU)\n\nI have about $5,000 I'd like to invest right now and I have half a mind to just put it equally weighted into these 11 companies and just watch it for the next year or two. I'll either do that or put it all in VOO, but I have a feeling that these 11 companies might beat the S&P 500 over the next 24 months.\n\nWhat do you guys think?",

For example, we shop at Kroger (KR), bank with Bank of America (BAC), and use apps like DraftKings and Robinhood. Would a portfolio composed of the top 10 things you use daily, each linked to a publicly traded company, be a good strategy? Naturally, this would involve keeping up with the companies by reading reports, 10-Ks, and other necessary information.\n\nHere's a potential portfolio based on my daily use:\n\n1. Visa (V)\n2. Kroger (KR)\n3. ExxonMobil (XOM)\n4. Amazon (AMZN)\n5. Robinhood (HOOD)\n6. Hims & Hers Health (HIMS)\n7. Toyota (TM)\n8. Wells Fargo (WFC)\n9. Google (GOOGL)\n10.

    "selftext": "I had a managed brokerage account for a few years when I was employed but when I retired in 2016 I decided I had the time to learn about investing and manage my own portfolio (I also have a 401k that is 65% of my total retirement egg but I can no longer contribute to it). I have come up to reasonable speed on stocks but I don't quite understand how bonds work. I do understand the (arguable, it seems) premise that bonds are generally less volatile than stocks and so are a balancing force in a portfolio. However, my question is: specifically -- 2 big chunks (30%) of my brokerage account are bond funds -- MTBIX and WMBIX. For the past 10 years at least these fund shares gone up and down by only a couple dollars (e.g. $8 to $10), as does their total gain/loss, however every month I get a non-taxable distribution from them which I've set up to reinvest. Is that basically how bonds work - you hold them and get regular (tax free) distributions from them? \n\nWhat I'm really trying to determine is should I keep these funds or sell them off to invest more in some basic ETFs instead. The rest of my brokerage portfolio is 60% in popular ETFs like VOO, SPYG, QQQ, SMH, and the rest in a handful of large-cap tech stocks -- AMZN, MSFT, NVDA, APPL. I should mention my 401k is quite broadly diversified across asset classes with 50% in equities the rest in fixed, guaranteed, bonds, REITs. \n\nI'm fairly comfortable I have enough cheddar in my combined brokerage and 401k accounts to fund my remaining retirement even through volatile market periods, but I'm just not clear if these 2 bond funds fit into my more risky brokerage account beyond just added stability and tax benefits, given my 401k is already fairly conservative and 65% of my overall investments.\n\nAny thoughts or education on this most appreciated!

Insight\u00a0\n2. Conviction\u00a0\n3. Patience\n\n**Insight**\n\nI\u2019ve learned to largely ignore headlines and talking heads, which seem more reactionary than insightful and optimizing for entertainment (clicks/views).\u00a0\n\nBen Graham\u2019s quote rings true:\u00a0\n\n>\u201cIn the short run, the market is a voting machine but in the long run, it is a weighing machine.\u201d\n\nPerhaps counterintuitively, I\u2019ve found it more useful to read/listen to tech/business analysts who focus on strategy and how that interacts with macro trends (along with financials) than solely financial analysts and stock pickers.\u00a0\n\nFinancials are a good indicator of fundamentals, but are backward-looking. However, valuation is forward-looking, thus driven by strategy x trends x structural advantages, so we must consider both.\u00a0\n\n# Math\n\nIn 2023 I also started\u00a0practicing math daily\u00a0(243 days straight\u00a0as of this morning) in order to better understand the mathematics behind AI. As part of that, I had to take remedial coursework to build my foundations since it had been so long since I\u2019d done any meaningful math.\u00a0\n\nI\u2019m not sure how much, but it\u00a0*feels*\u00a0like it helped with the reallocation decisions I made in late 2023 and early 2024. I felt more confident and deliberate in making trades. The math journey has been quite challenging, but personally rewarding, whether it has helped or not.\u00a0\n\n**Conviction**\n\nA big part of this is just a better understanding of myself and what kind of investor I am. I invest in what I believe in long-term.\u00a0\n\nHowever, someone trading on volatility with a much shorter timeline may not care about conviction. You must understand what investment philosophy aligns with your psychology and your strengths.\u00a0\n\nConviction investing works for me because, even when building products (my day job), I\u2019ve always been strong with product vision/strategy and always building for the future, so it makes sense that I invest the same way. I\u2019m not sure why it took me so long to connect those dots, but I\u2019m happy I did.\u00a0\n\nA big part of this is also timing. AI seems to be a once-in-a-generation opportunity. Whereas 5 years ago I might have tried to force myself to believe crypto was the next big thing in the absence of anything substantial.\u00a0\n\nThis is another reminder that success (in investing or otherwise) is all about timing and opportunity. When opportunities arise,\u00a0you must seize them.\n\n**Patience**\n\nAs a result of my convictions, I\u2019m much more patient in my investing these days and don\u2019t react to the day-to-day.\u00a0\n\nI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if I don\u2019t make another trade for the rest of 2024.\n\n**UPDATE:**\n\nA commenter asked about benchmarks, which I failed to include since I don't pay attention to them, so I had to look it up:\n\nI opened my portfolio in June 2022. Since then the cumulative S&P return is \\~28% (\\~39% for Nasdaq). My cumulative return for that same period is around \\~215%. The annual rate of return (per my Vanguard dashboard) is 77.9% as mentioned in the original post. I would expect my returns to revert to the mean over time.",

    "selftext": "Update: After reading some articles and examples Daily ETP have Stop-Loss in them unfortunately... This means that long ETP would trigger a SL if the underlying stock drops \\~16.6% in a single day. So that's how the ETP originators earn money.  \n\nHello Everyone,\n\nWhy are retail traders not completely ignoring CFD trades and going all in on low priced leveraged ETPs (pennies)?\n\nExample is GraniteShares 3x Long AMD Daily ETC (3LAM.L) currently just 2.74$\n\nWe all know that chances are AMD will be more valuable in a year compared to now, as the AI hype wouldn't die in a year. There is too much market share to be taken away from Nvidia and the market doesn't even have too - the demand is currently way higher than the supply, so it's only a plus! The issue with futures and CFDs are that you pay fees, have stop loss and need to know very precisely how much and in which direction the market will move between the opening and closing of your position. With ETP you don't care, as you don't have daily fees or stop loss and inflation is your friend, as generally more money will be put into the profitable stocks sooner or later due to rising expenses and thus prices.\n\nThis ETP has made 20.1% in a day while AMD 5.25%\n\nThe NVDA equivalent has made from 6$ to 150$ in just a year. Using x5 leverage maybe could provide that return, but at a MASSIVE risk. How likely was it to lose money from NVDA 1 year ago by buying this ETP at just 6$? Similar ETPs for the other tech companies are already trading at far higher ranges than just 2-3$.\n\nFor some reason this Google ETP 3LAL hasn't reach it's ATH although currently GOOG is trading around ATH. I guess it has to do with when the ETP starts trading on the market or maybe it doesn't monitor stock splits/dillutions.\n\nI am wondering who is on the other sides of those ETP trades? You cannot convince me that people are shorting 3LAM while it's at a silly 2.74$ (was around 0.3$ when AMD was 80$) and AMD just recently started it's AI hyped bull run. Sure it already made around 300% in a year, but so did NVDA and AMD started from way lower market cap! I was actually shorting NVDA around 500-600$ range, as I didn't do any due diligence on it's main product behind everything :( - the Tensor A100 and how many orders were for it etc.\n\nPlease try to give me arguments why 3LAM would be a bad investment to buy and hold for 1 year if AMD - besides AMD getting priced less than 202$ per share? The fees is around 0.3% per trade without any daily fees from what I could tell.\n\nAnother example is 3LVW if you think Volkswagen will recover (I do) :). It has massive debt, but pays 8% in dividends.\n\nDisclaimer - I put have put my money where my mouth is, but I stay open to corrections about my understandings, as I have been proven very wrong recently about AMZN and why it's valued this high.\n\nWhy is math not working in some cases? Microstrategy did around x10 increase in a single year. The ETP did around 10 000 times increase?!\n\n3LMI went from 0.01$ to 337.71$ - it seems like the starting price is the biggest factor, as this is not just x30 times increase (due to the x3 leverage), but an insane 3 377 000% - good luck for any crypto to beat that!\n\nI couldn't find a single ETP in GraniteShares portfolio of products that achieved the opposite - starting from 1-10$ range and going down to 0.00001$ etc.",

I will probably have the Roth IRA managed by my retirement company once I exit those positions so I don\u2019t have to worry about it. I\u2019ll also be getting quite the tax harvest from the selling the positions in my brokerage account. \n\nWith all the losing positions I sell in my brokerage, I\u2019ll have ~40k of cash to do whatever with. The other ~$63k is invested in TSLA, Google, Microsoft, Apple, AMD & AMZN. I have a $30k position in TSLA, so that\u2019s most of it. \n\nI\u2019m thinking about taking the $40k I get from my losses and putting it in a HYSA, but not sure that would be the best thing to do. I think it would certainly be much less stressful than investing over $100k myself, but I also don\u2019t think I\u2019ll need the money very soon. \n\nI\u2019m single and currently live in Denver (I hate it here), and would love to be able to go to a warmer place, potentially San Diego if I can afford it.

TSLA may also see a small downward weighting. Smaller stocks should see a small increase in the weight.\n\nETFs/mutual funds that try to follow the Nasdaq 100 (such as $QQQ) will need to adjust their holdings accordingly. So you should expect them to sell the largest stocks and buy the smaller ones -- perhaps they already have -- and that will affect the prices of those stocks accordingly.\n\nIt also means that those ETFs/mutual funds will not accurately reflect the relative weight of the largest stocks. So if you wish to be weighted according to actual market cap, you would need to supplement those holdings.\n\nNormally the index rebalances every quarter. But the largest stocks are dominating the index and funds that follow the index need to maintain compliance with a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rule on fund diversification. On July 3, the largest six stocks saw their combined weight reach 50.9% of the index.\n\nRead more in this [Reuters \"Explainer\"](https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/what-is-nasdaqs-special-rebalancing-its-impact-2023-07-11/) or [Bloomberg article](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-10/big-tech-s-dominance-in-stock-market-hits-breaking-point-for-nasdaq-100) (paywall) or Matt Levine's [Money Stuff newsletter](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2023-07-11/matt-levine-s-money-stuff-elon-musk-blames-the-lawyers) (paywall/signup)",

    "selftext": "With AI being the new hot topic out there, we see so many companies investing a lot of resources in R&D hoping for a big breakthrough. While it is normal to see emerging companies being innovative and investors looking for opportunities, it can also be seen that companies such as MSFT, GOOGL, AAPL, AMZN are heavily invested into the idea, particularly MSFT with its continuous investment into OpenAI.\n\nI don't see AI being an investment fad, for a lack of a better term, like it can be argued that blockchain, cryptocurrencies or NFTs were at some point. With that, I am mostly referring to ordinary investors that would invest in such assets on a long-term basis rather than traders looking for large returns with any of the financial instruments at their disposal.\n\nGiven the fact that the companies mentioned above already represent a fair share of the S&P 500 index, is it safe to assume that any potential global breakthrough in AI is going to affect the value of any relevant ETFs since we do not know which of those major companies is going to be the first/best to reap the benefits of AI? Or the more risky approach of picking stocks like MSFT and emerging companies is more likely to be more profitable?\n\nSome may argue that a breakthrough in AI R&D is imminent but that it might actually result in a dot-com bubble-like crash because the current market prices have already factored in the expectation of larger returns which may or may not actually happen with AI.\n\nIn a nutshell, can S&P 500 ETF investing reap the benefits of a potential AI revolution or investors still have to take the risk and pick individual stocks? Can a crash of S&P 500 value be expected because some sectors could potentially lose value with AI or the prices are already too ambitious with some expectations on AI?",

    "selftext": "From [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/apple-to-spend-billions-more-on-entertainment-7370447)\n\n\"Apple Inc. (AAPL), the world's most valuable company, is mulling a billion-plus dollar foray into movie theaters and sports streaming in an attempt to drive subscriber growth for its Apple TV+ streaming platform.\n\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\nApple could spend more than $1 billion a year to ramp up its movie releases and sports streaming.\n\nThe company is reportedly in talks with film studios to partner on theatrical releases of movies by Martin Scorsese and Ridley Scott.\n\nPreviously, Apple has devoted most of its $6.5 billion film and TV budget to television programs.\n\nThe move could help to drive viewers to Apple's streaming platform, Apple TV+, which lags far behind competitors like Amazon and Netflix.\n\nApple is expected to spend $1 billion a year to produce movies for theatrical release. \n\nThe company is reportedly in talks with movie studios to partner on the releases of upcoming movies by Martin Scorsese, Ridley Scott, and others.\n\nThe company is also reportedly considering bidding on the streaming rights to English football games.\n\n\nThe new plans constitute a significant increase in Apple's entertainment spending that could be part of an effort to draw more interest in Apple TV+, which lags behind rivals in subscriptions. Apple TV+ has an estimated 40 million subscribers, compared with at least 200 million each for Amazon's (AMZN) Prime Video and Netflix (NFLX).\n\n\nApple also lags behind rivals in content spending. The company spent about $6.5 billion on movies and television in 2021, while Amazon and Netflix spent $9 billion and $17 billion respectively.\n\n\nSo far, Apple's greatest streaming success has been in television, with the acclaimed series Ted Lasso. The business of releasing movies for wide theatrical distribution may be more complex, particularly given theater chains' struggles to rebound from COVID-19 and fend off competition from streaming services. Movie ticket sales are about a third below 2019 levels. Chains like AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. (AMC) have attributed the sluggish sales to a shortage of available films.\n\nApple's distribution agreements may help boost ticket sales, and it is not the only tech company entering theaters. Amazon acquired major studio Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer for $8.5 billion last year and now plans to make up to 15 movies for theatrical release each year. \n\nIn each case, Apple and Amazon may attempt to drive streaming viewership by later releasing those films on their respective platforms.\n\nApple's interest in adding English football games to its streaming platform follows last year's $2.5 billion 10-year streaming deal with U.S. Major League Soccer. Terms of a potential deal between Apple and the UK's Premier League have not been disclosed.\"\n\nPersonally, this sounds like the kind of move that more streamers (looking at you, Netflix) need to make. They aren't going to be throwing ridiculous money at it, but the content they are looking to produce is starting to look more like HBO level quality. If they have acclaimed directors like Scorsese and Ridley Scott on board, they could get their films in with a big theatrical release, make a shit tonne of money, THEN bring it onto streaming (much like Paramount did with Top Gun Maverick) for a bigger subscriber gain. Sounds like a win win win to me and we all know Apple has $billions in pocket change to throw at this.",

Any suggestions on stocks or routes to take would be appreciated, as my only resources / research (if you can call it that) are from reddit and YouTube.",

    "title": "Covered Calls - Risks for a long term investor",
    "selftext": "Hey all, new to options. I'm a longterm investor, and I don't really plan on ever going outside of my comfort zone of choosing positions that I believe in the long term (so nothing outside of covered calls really). I am still confused on just some aspects about covered calls regarding risk and theory.\n\nI have two questions:\n\n1.) When I own 100 shares of AMZN at price 95 (long position). Say my strike price is 102. However within the timeframe of the option, the stock price went DOWN to 89. The option is definitely worthless and will not be exercised. Here, I can collect that premium I got. However, there really is no risk here right? I never planned to sell my AMZN shares in the first place would it have gone down (and instead would have just dollar cost averaged over time). So I collect the premium for free right?\n\n2.) Choosing a strike price that is way OTM. Meaning I have 100 shares of AMZN at 95. What is stopping me from choosing a strike price that is ridiculously high so that I can feel comfortable that it wont really necessarily reach that within the expiration date? Say a strike price of 120. I do understand that the premium that I get would be drastically lower, but what really is the risk to this or con? Something has to give right? I think what I am trying to understand is, someone has to choose to buy the option, and if there is no buyer, then I get no premium however little it is, and I'm only just out 65 cents of the option writing fee right? Or say the premium is absurdly low where it's below even the 65 cents fee were somehow someone actually bought it and i just pay the difference in the premium and the 65 cent fee? This is the theoretical bit I'd like to know. Obviously with covered calls, there is no point if you don't get a premium. \n\nI really appreciate anyone helping me on this. I'm a long term investor so I don't mind the downside of a stock going down, but I would really like for me to minimize the chance for the call to be exercised (although I definitely know it happens). If it were to be exercised it's not the end of the world for me either.",

    "title": "Tech growth stock portfolio reallocation and diversification out of Apple",
    "selftext": "I'm looking to create a portfolio with relatively safe tech growth stocks. I know that sounds like a bit of an oxymoron, but I'm looking to diversify out of my AAPL position. 77% of my portfolio is in the s&p 500. The rest is in AAPL.\n\nI don't think AAPL is going anywhere, and they obviously have a loyal customer base and I think Apple TV is putting out some great content. I also love how vertically integrated they are. That being said, I think they've reached market saturation in most areas and it seems the pace of innovation has slowed. I'm thinking about selling 50%+ of my AAPL position because over the years it has grown to represent 23% of my portfolio and that just seems like too much for any one individual stock.\n\nI'm considering divesting and reallocating into the following positions:\n\nGOOGL\nMSFT\nAMZN\nTSM\nNVDA\nMETA\nTSLA\n\n1. Google needs no introduction, but the stock is at super low p/e ratios and they continuously try (mostly unsuccessfully) to innovate across multiple sectors. Ads are obviously the bread and butter, but YouTube is the biggest threat to cable and streaming services. YouTube content is vast, high quality, and free!\n\n2. Microsoft is also at pretty low p/e ratios. Azure is #2 cloud service. Gaming sector is growing and Sony/PlayStation is falling behind. Biggest thing for me is their investment into AI tech such as OpenAI (aka chatGPT). Overall they have diverse revenue streams and continue to innovate.\n\n3. Amazon is not just ecommerce, but at absolute logistics giant. #1 cloud service. Decent streaming service. And they continuously reinvest into the company. They're also down more than others on this list in the past year.\n\n4. Taiwanese Semiconductor is the world's leading chip manufacturer. P/e is low, but partly because of inflated chip prices. Biggest fear is Chinese government interference, but the $40 billion investment into the Arizona factory is encouraging.\n\n5. Nvidia makes the most powerful chips in the world and has great partnerships with other leaders in tech. Also one of the leaders in AI technology. Downside is sky high p/e and it's down the least over the last year, so not the best value.\n\n6. META for me is the hardest to evaluate. On one hand Facebook and Instagram are absolute social media giants that print money, but on the other hand I don't see nearly as much potential for growth. VR technology is cool, but it's a long way away from being mainstream. If that ever happens, there's no guarantee that META will be the ones to do it.\n\n7. Tesla has obviously been hammered the most on this list, but I'm not sure it's totally warranted. Whatever Musk is doing at Twitter shouldn't really affect Tesla as much as it has. P/e ratio is back to reality somewhat and they continue to lead ev sales. Other manufacturers are struggling to catch up, it's happening, but much slower than anyone expected. If Tesla continues to keep it's foot on the gas and continues to improve it's qc and manufacturing processes, I see them remaining a leader in the ev field for years to come.\n\n\nSo Reddit, what do you think of my choices? And are there any other companies you think I missed and should look into? What percentage would you allocate into the above companies?",

    "title": "Meta and Amazon Earnings: Time to Buy these Beaten-Down Tech Stocks?",
    "selftext": "Breaking down Meta Platforms, Inc. (META) and Amazon (AMZN) ahead of their upcoming earnings results to see if investors might want to finally buy these beaten-down tech stocks.\n\n**The Nasdaq climbed again through mid-afternoon trading on Friday, alongside the wider market as Wall Street continues to buy tech stocks**\n\n>meta exclusive news\uff1a[https://www.reddit.com/r/TopInvestment\\_CA/comments/10an9pr/us\\_stock\\_marketdow\\_futures\\_steady\\_after\\_cpi\\_eases/](https://www.reddit.com/r/TopInvestment_CA/comments/10an9pr/us_stock_marketdow_futures_steady_after_cpi_eases/)\n\nThe market faced a big test mid-week and the bulls won out, for now, helping push the S&P 500 back above its 50-day and 200-day moving averages and the 4000 level.\n\nMore importantly, the Nasdaq jumped above its 200-day moving average for the first time in roughly a year. The market has bought up Tesla since its report, with the stock up 10% in back-to-back sessions. Microsoft stock has already erased its post-earnings pullback to extend its bullish start to 2023.\n\n**The broadly upbeat start to the busy part of quarterly earnings season suggests that Wall Street thinks the earnings downturn is already mostly priced in. If the outlook for earnings does indeed hold up, the market could easily extend its recent bullishness.**\n\nPlus, Wall Street feels the Fed is all but certain to roll out a 0.25% rate hike when its FOMC meeting concludes on February 1. Investors also appear convinced that a Fed pivot is on the horizon sooner than later.\n\nThis upbeat market backdrop likely has more and more investors wondering if it is time to dive back into the beaten-down tech titans, with Meta Platforms (META) and Amazon (AMZN) as the primary examples.\n\nMeta, formerly Facebook, reports its Q4 FY22 financial results on February 1. The social media giant posted its second consecutive revenue drop in Q3, while its metaverse bet is off to a brutal start.\n\nMeta\u2019s growth days are no doubt over for now. But Wall Street spent a long time beating down the stock to help it more accurately reflect where Meta is in its lifecycle.\n\nMeta's valuation is looking enticing and let\u2019s not forget that it still reached 3.7 billion people a month across Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp and nearly 3 billion daily. Meta stock has soared around 70% off its November lows, as investors start to dive back into the company for its ability to play a dominant role in a crucial area of the digital economy and venture into new areas with a balance sheet that\u2019s still very impressive.\n\n**Like Meta, Amazon stock has suffered a massive fall from grace as it too made big bets and faces a major slowdown from its days of huge growth.**\n\nAmazon is set to release its Q4 fiscal 2022 results on February 2. AMZN, under the guidance of CEO Andy Jassy, is fighting to cut costs where it can as it aims to slim down a business that expands from e-commerce and cloud computing to an online pharmacy and movie and TV production.\n\nAmazon\u2019s growth is slowing, but it is still projected to expand its top line by roughly 9% in FY22 and Y23, which is no easy task for a firm set to pull in $510 billion in revenue in fiscal 2022. Amazon is still down over 40% from its peaks, including its nearly 25% climb in January.\n\n&#x200B;",
